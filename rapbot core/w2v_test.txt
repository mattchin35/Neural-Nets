    with fearful bloody issue arbitrate <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  our strong possession and our right for us

                     brother

    what men are you
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  your faithful subject i a gentleman
    born in northamptonshire and eldest son
    as i suppose to robert faulconbridge
    a soldier by the honourgiving hand
    of coeurdelion knighted in the field <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  what art thou
  robert <SENTENCE-END>  the son and heir to that same faulconbridge <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  is that the elder and art thou the heir
    you came not of one mother then it seems <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  most certain of one mother mighty king
    that is well known and as i think one father
    but for the certain knowledge of that truth
    i put you oer to heaven and to my mother <SENTENCE-END> 
    of that i doubt as all mens children may <SENTENCE-END> 
  elinor <SENTENCE-END>  out on thee rude man thou dost shame thy mother
    and wound her honour with this diffidence <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  i madam no i have no reason for it  
    that is my brothers plea and none of mine
    the which if he can prove a pops me out
    at least from fair five hundred pound a year <SENTENCE-END> 
    heaven guard my mothers honour and my land
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  a good blunt fellow <SENTENCE-END>  why being younger born
    doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  i know not why except to get the land <SENTENCE-END> 
    but once he slanderd me with bastardy
    but wheer i be as true begot or no
    that still i lay upon my mothers head
    but that i am as well begot my liege
    fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
    compare our faces and be judge yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
    if old sir robert did beget us both
    and were our father and this son like him
    o old sir robert father on my knee
    i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
  elinor <SENTENCE-END>  he hath a trick of coeurdelions face
    the accent of his tongue affecteth him <SENTENCE-END>   
    do you not read some tokens of my son
    in the large composition of this man
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  mine eye hath well examined his parts
    and finds them perfect richard <SENTENCE-END>  sirrah speak
    what doth move you to claim your brothers land
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  because he hath a halfface like my father <SENTENCE-END> 
    with half that face would he have all my land
    a halffacd groat five hundred pound a year
  robert <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious liege when that my father livd
    your brother did employ my father much
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  well sir by this you cannot get my land
    your tale must be how he employd my mother <SENTENCE-END> 
  robert <SENTENCE-END>  and once dispatchd him in an embassy
    to germany there with the emperor
    to treat of high affairs touching that time <SENTENCE-END> 
    th advantage of his absence took the king
    and in the meantime sojournd at my fathers
    where how he did prevail i shame to speak
    but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
    between my father and my mother lay  
    as i have heard my father speak himself
    when this same lusty gentleman was got <SENTENCE-END> 
    upon his deathbed he by will bequeathd
    his lands to me and took it on his death
    that this my mothers son was none of his
    and if he were he came into the world
    full fourteen weeks before the course of time <SENTENCE-END> 
    then good my liege let me have what is mine
    my fathers land as was my fathers will <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  sirrah your brother is legitimate
    your fathers wife did after wedlock bear him
    and if she did play false the fault was hers
    which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
    that marry wives <SENTENCE-END>  tell me how if my brother
    who as you say took pains to get this son

    and for amends to his posterity

    to spread his colours boy in thy behalf
    and to rebuke the usurpation
    of thy unnatural uncle english john <SENTENCE-END> 
    embrace him love him give him welcome hither <SENTENCE-END>

    the rather that you give his offspring life
    shadowing their right under your wings of war <SENTENCE-END> 
    i give you welcome with a powerless hand  
    but with a heart full of unstained love
    welcome before the gates of angiers duke <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  a noble boy who would not do thee right
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
    as seal to this indenture of my love
    that to my home i will no more return
    till angiers and the right thou hast in france
    together with that pale that whitefacd shore
    whose foot spurns back the oceans roaring tides
    and coops from other lands her islanders
    even till that england hedgd in with the main
    that waterwalled bulwark still secure
    and confident from foreign purposes
    even till that utmost corner of the west
    salute thee for her king <SENTENCE-END>  till then fair boy
    will i not think of home but follow arms <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  o take his mothers thanks a widows thanks
    till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
    to make a more requital to your love
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords  
    in such a just and charitable war <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  well then to work our cannon shall be bent
    against the brows of this resisting town
    call for our chiefest men of discipline
    to cull the plots of best advantages <SENTENCE-END> 
    well lay before this town our royal bones
    wade to the marketplace in frenchmens blood
    but we will make it subject to this boy <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  stay for an answer to your embassy
    lest unadvisd you stain your swords with blood
    my lord chatillon may from england bring
    that right in peace which here we urge in war
    and then we shall repent each drop of blood
    that hot rash haste so indirectly shed <SENTENCE-END>

  chatillon <SENTENCE-END>  then turn your forces from this paltry siege
    and stir them up against a mightier task <SENTENCE-END>

    an ate stirring him to blood and strife
    with her the lady blanch of spain
    with them a bastard of the kings deceasd
    and all th unsettled humours of the land
    rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
    with ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens
    have sold their fortunes at their native homes
    bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
    to make a hazard of new fortunes here <SENTENCE-END> 
    in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits  
    than now the english bottoms have waft oer
    did never float upon the swelling tide
    to do offence and scathe in christendom <SENTENCE-END>              drum beats
    the interruption of their churlish drums
    cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
    to parley or to fight therefore prepare <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  how much unlookd for is this expedition
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  by how much unexpected by so much

    our trumpet calld you to this gentle parle
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  for our advantage therefore hear us first <SENTENCE-END> 
    these flags of france that are advanced here
    before the eye and prospect of your town
    have hither marchd to your endamagement
    the cannons have their bowels full of wrath
    and ready mounted are they to spit forth
    their iron indignation gainst your walls
    all preparation for a bloody siege
    and merciless proceeding by these french
    confront your citys eyes your winking gates
    and but for our approach those sleeping stones
    that as a waist doth girdle you about
    by the compulsion of their ordinance
    by this time from their fixed beds of lime  
    had been dishabited and wide havoc made
    for bloody power to rush upon your peace <SENTENCE-END> 
    but on the sight of us your lawful king
    who painfully with much expedient march
    have brought a countercheck before your gates
    to save unscratchd your citys threatned cheeks
    behold the french amazd vouchsafe a parle
    and now instead of bullets wrappd in fire
    to make a shaking fever in your walls
    they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
    to make a faithless error in your cars
    which trust accordingly kind citizens
    and let us inyour king whose labourd spirits
    forwearied in this action of swift speed
    craves harbourage within your city walls <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  when i have said make answer to us both <SENTENCE-END> 
    lo in this right hand whose protection
    is most divinely vowd upon the right
    of him it holds stands young plantagenet
    son to the elder brother of this man  
    and king oer him and all that he enjoys
    for this downtrodden equity we tread
    in warlike march these greens before your town
    being no further enemy to you
    than the constraint of hospitable zeal
    in the relief of this oppressed child
    religiously provokes <SENTENCE-END>  be pleased then
    to pay that duty which you truly owe
    to him that owes it namely this young prince
    and then our arms like to a muzzled bear
    save in aspect hath all offence seald up
    our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
    against th invulnerable clouds of heaven
    and with a blessed and unvexd retire
    with unhackd swords and helmets all unbruisd
    we will bear home that lusty blood again
    which here we came to spout against your town
    and leave your children wives and you in peace <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if you fondly pass our profferd offer
    tis not the roundure of your oldfacd walls  
    can hide you from our messengers of war
    though all these english and their discipline
    were harbourd in their rude circumference <SENTENCE-END> 
    then tell us shall your city call us lord
    in that behalf which we have challengd it
    or shall we give the signal to our rage
    and stalk in blood to our possession
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  in brief we are the king of englands subjects
    for him and in his right we hold this town <SENTENCE-END>

  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  that can we not but he that proves the king
    to him will we prove loyal <SENTENCE-END>  till that time
    have we rammd up our gates against the world <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  doth not the crown of england prove the king
    and if not that i bring you witnesses
    twice fifteen thousand hearts of englands breed
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  bastards and else <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  to verify our title with their lives <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  as many and as wellborn bloods as those
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  some bastards too <SENTENCE-END>   
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  stand in his face to contradict his claim <SENTENCE-END> 
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  till you compound whose right is worthiest
    we for the worthiest hold the right from both <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  then god forgive the sin of all those souls
    that to their everlasting residence

  french herald <SENTENCE-END>  you men of angiers open wide your gates
    and let young arthur duke of britaine in
    who by the hand of france this day hath made
    much work for tears in many an english mother
    whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
    many a widows husband grovelling lies
    coldly embracing the discoloured earth
    and victory with little loss doth play
    upon the dancing banners of the french
    who are at hand triumphantly displayed
    to enter conquerors and to proclaim
    arthur of britaine englands king and yours <SENTENCE-END> 

         enter english herald with trumpet
  
  english herald <SENTENCE-END>  rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells
    king john your king and englands doth approach
    commander of this hot malicious day <SENTENCE-END> 
    their armours that marchd hence so silverbright
    hither return all gilt with frenchmens blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    there stuck no plume in any english crest
    that is removed by a staff of france
    our colours do return in those same hands
    that did display them when we first marchd forth
    and like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
    our lusty english all with purpled hands
    dyd in the dying slaughter of their foes <SENTENCE-END> 
    open your gates and give the victors way <SENTENCE-END> 
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  heralds from off our towrs we might behold
    from first to last the onset and retire
    of both your armies whose equality
    by our best eyes cannot be censured <SENTENCE-END> 
    blood hath bought blood and blows have answerd blows
    strength matchd with strength and power confronted power
    both are alike and both alike we like <SENTENCE-END>   
    one must prove greatest <SENTENCE-END>  while they weigh so even
    we hold our town for neither yet for both <SENTENCE-END> 

    enter the two kings with their powers at several doors

  king john <SENTENCE-END>  france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
    say shall the current of our right run on
    whose passage vexd with thy impediment
    shall leave his native channel and oerswell
    with course disturbd even thy confining shores
    unless thou let his silver water keep
    a peaceful progress to the ocean <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  england thou hast not savd one drop of blood
    in this hot trial more than we of france
    rather lost more <SENTENCE-END>  and by this hand i swear
    that sways the earth this climate overlooks
    before we will lay down our justborne arms
    well put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear
    or add a royal number to the dead
    gracing the scroll that tells of this wars loss  
    with slaughter coupled to the name of kings <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  ha majesty how high thy glory towrs
    when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
    o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel
    the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
    and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
    in undetermind differences of kings <SENTENCE-END> 
    why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
    cry havoc kings back to the stained field
    you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
    then let confusion of one part confirm
    the others peace <SENTENCE-END>  till then blows blood and death
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  whose party do the townsmen yet admit
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  speak citizens for england whos your king
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  the king of england when we know the king <SENTENCE-END>

    and till it be undoubted we do lock
    our former scruple in our strongbarrd gates
    kingd of our fears until our fears resolvd
    be by some certain king purgd and deposd <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings
    and stand securely on their battlements
    as in a theatre whence they gape and point
    at your industrious scenes and acts of death <SENTENCE-END> 
    your royal presences be ruld by me
    do like the mutines of jerusalem
    be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
    your sharpest deeds of malice on this town <SENTENCE-END> 
    by east and west let france and england mount
    their battering cannon charged to the mouths
    till their soulfearing clamours have brawld down
    the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city <SENTENCE-END> 
    id play incessantly upon these jades
    even till unfenced desolation
    leave them as naked as the vulgar air <SENTENCE-END> 
    that done dissever your united strengths  
    and part your mingled colours once again
    turn face to face and bloody point to point
    then in a moment fortune shall cull forth
    out of one side her happy minion
    to whom in favour she shall give the day
    and kiss him with a glorious victory <SENTENCE-END> 
    how like you this wild counsel mighty states
    smacks it not something of the policy
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  now by the sky that hangs above our heads
    i like it well <SENTENCE-END>  france shall we knit our powrs
    and lay this angiers even with the ground
    then after fight who shall be king of it
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  an if thou hast the mettle of a king
    being wrongd as we are by this peevish town
    turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
    as we will ours against these saucy walls
    and when that we have dashd them to the ground
    why then defy each other and pellmell
    make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  let it be so <SENTENCE-END>  say where will you assault  
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  we from the west will send destruction
    into this citys bosom <SENTENCE-END> 
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  i from the north <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  our thunder from the south
    shall rain their drift of bullets on this town <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>   aside  o prudent discipline from north to south
    austria and france shoot in each others mouth <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill stir them to it <SENTENCE-END> come away away
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
    and i shall show you peace and fairfacd league

    that here come sacrifices for the field <SENTENCE-END> 
    persever not but hear me mighty kings <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  speak on with favour we are bent to hear <SENTENCE-END> 
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  that daughter there of spain the lady blanch
    is niece to england look upon the years
    of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid <SENTENCE-END> 
    if lusty love should go in quest of beauty
    where should he find it fairer than in blanch  
    if zealous love should go in search of virtue
    where should he find it purer than in blanch
    if love ambitious sought a match of birth
    whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
    such as she is in beauty virtue birth
    is the young dauphin every way complete
    if not complete of say he is not she
    and she again wants nothing to name want
    if want it be not that she is not he <SENTENCE-END> 
    he is the half part of a blessed man
    left to be finished by such as she
    and she a fair divided excellence
    whose fulness of perfection lies in him <SENTENCE-END> 
    o two such silver currents when they join
    do glorify the banks that bound them in
    and two such shores to two such streams made one
    two such controlling bounds shall you be kings
    to these two princes if you marry them <SENTENCE-END> 
    this union shall do more than battery can
    to our fastclosed gates for at this match  
    with swifter spleen than powder can enforce
    the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
    and give you entrance but without this match
    the sea enraged is not half so deaf
    lions more confident mountains and rocks
    more free from motionno not death himself
    in mortal fury half so peremptory
    as we to keep this city <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  heres a stay
    that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
    out of his rags heres a large mouth indeed
    that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
    talks as familiarly of roaring lions
    as maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
    what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
    he speaks plain cannonfire and smoke and bounce
    he gives the bastinado with his tongue
    our ears are cudgelld not a word of his
    but buffets better than a fist of france <SENTENCE-END> 
    zounds i was never so bethumpd with words  
    since i first calld my brothers father dad <SENTENCE-END> 
  elinor <SENTENCE-END>  son list to this conjunction make this match
    give with our niece a dowry large enough
    for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
    thy now unsurd assurance to the crown
    that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
    the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit <SENTENCE-END> 
    i see a yielding in the looks of france
    mark how they whisper <SENTENCE-END>  urge them while their souls
    are capable of this ambition
    lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
    of soft petitions pity and remorse
    cool and congeal again to what it was <SENTENCE-END> 
  citizen <SENTENCE-END>  why answer not the double majesties
    this friendly treaty of our threatned town
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  speak england first that hath been forward first
    to speak unto this city what say you
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  if that the dauphin there thy princely son
    can in this book of beauty read i love
    her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen  
    for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers
    and all that we upon this side the sea
    except this city now by us besiegd
    find liable to our crown and dignity
    shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
    in titles honours and promotions
    as she in beauty education blood
    holds hand with any princess of the world <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  what sayst thou boy look in the ladys face <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  i do my lord and in her eye i find
    a wonder or a wondrous miracle
    the shadow of myself formd in her eye
    which being but the shadow of your son
    becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow <SENTENCE-END> 
    i do protest i never lovd myself
    till now infixed i beheld myself
    drawn in the flattering table of her eye <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               whispers with blanch
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>   aside  drawn in the flattering table of her eye
    hangd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow  
    and quarterd in her hearthe doth espy
    himself loves traitor <SENTENCE-END>  this is pity now
    that hangd and drawn and quarterd there should be
    in such a love so vile a lout as he <SENTENCE-END> 
  blanch <SENTENCE-END>  my uncles will in this respect is mine <SENTENCE-END> 
    if he see aught in you that makes him like
    that anything he sees which moves his liking
    i can with ease translate it to my will
    or if you will to speak more properly
    i will enforce it easly to my love <SENTENCE-END> 
    further i will not flatter you my lord
    that all i see in you is worthy love
    than this that nothing do i see in you
    though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
    that i can find should merit any hate <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  what say these young ones what say you my niece
  blanch <SENTENCE-END>  that she is bound in honour still to do
    what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  nay ask me if i can refrain from love  
    for i do love her most unfeignedly <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  then do i give volquessen touraine maine
    poictiers and anjou these five provinces
    with her to thee and this addition more
    full thirty thousand marks of english coin <SENTENCE-END> 
    philip of france if thou be pleasd withal
    command thy son and daughter to join hands <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  it likes us well young princes close your hands <SENTENCE-END> 
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  and your lips too for i am well assurd
    that i did so when i was first assurd <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  now citizens of angiers ope your gates
    let in that amity which you have made
    for at saint marys chapel presently
    the rites of marriage shall be solemnizd <SENTENCE-END> 
    is not the lady constance in this troop
    i know she is not for this match made up
    her presence would have interrupted much <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is she and her son tell me who knows <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  she is sad and passionate at your highness tent <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  and by my faith this league that we have made  
    will give her sadness very little cure <SENTENCE-END> 
    brother of england how may we content
    this widow lady in her right we came
    which we god knows have turnd another way
    to our own vantage <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  we will heal up all
    for well create young arthur duke of britaine
    and earl of richmond and this rich fair town
    we make him lord of <SENTENCE-END>  call the lady constance
    some speedy messenger bid her repair
    to our solemnity <SENTENCE-END>  i trust we shall
    if not fill up the measure of her will
    yet in some measure satisfy her so
    that we shall stop her exclamation <SENTENCE-END> 
    go we as well as haste will suffer us
    to this unlookdfor unprepared pomp <SENTENCE-END> 
                                           exeunt all but the bastard
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  mad world mad kings mad composition
    john to stop arthurs tide in the whole
    hath willingly departed with a part  
    and france whose armour conscience buckled on
    whom zeal and charity brought to the field
    as gods own soldier rounded in the ear
    with that same purposechanger that sly devil
    that broker that still breaks the pate of faith
    that daily breakvow he that wins of all
    of kings of beggars old men young men maids
    who having no external thing to lose
    but the word maid cheats the poor maid of that
    that smoothfacd gentleman tickling commodity
    commodity the bias of the world
    the world who of itself is peised well
    made to run even upon even ground
    till this advantage this viledrawing bias
    this sway of motion this commodity
    makes it take head from all indifferency
    from all direction purpose course intent
    and this same bias this commodity
    this bawd this broker this allchanging word
    clappd on the outward eye of fickle france  
    hath drawn him from his own determind aid
    from a resolvd and honourable war
    to a most base and vileconcluded peace <SENTENCE-END> 
    and why rail i on this commodity
    but for because he hath not wood me yet
    not that i have the power to clutch my hand
    when his fair angels would salute my palm
    but for my hand as unattempted yet
    like a poor beggar raileth on the rich <SENTENCE-END> 
    well whiles i am a beggar i will rail
    and say there is no sin but to be rich
    and being rich my virtue then shall be
    to say there is no vice but beggary <SENTENCE-END> 
    since kings break faith upon commodity
    gain be my lord for i will worship thee <SENTENCE-END>                    exit

    it cannot be thou dost but say tis so
    i trust i may not trust thee for thy word
    is but the vain breath of a common man
    believe me i do not believe thee man
    i have a kings oath to the contrary <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou shalt be punishd for thus frighting me
    for i am sick and capable of fears
    oppressd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
    a widow husbandless subject to fears
    a woman naturally born to fears
    and though thou now confess thou didst but jest  
    with my vexd spirits i cannot take a truce
    but they will quake and tremble all this day <SENTENCE-END> 
    what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
    why dost thou look so sadly on my son
    what means that hand upon that breast of thine
    why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
    like a proud river peering oer his bounds
    be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
    then speak againnot all thy former tale
    but this one word whether thy tale be true <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  as true as i believe you think them false
    that give you cause to prove my saying true <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
    teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
    and let belief and life encounter so
    as doth the fury of two desperate men
    which in the very meeting fall and die
    lewis marry blanch o boy then where art thou
    france friend with england what becomes of me
    fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight  
    this news hath made thee a most ugly man <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  what other harm have i good lady done
    but spoke the harm that is by others done
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  which harm within itself so heinous is
    as it makes harmful all that speak of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  i do beseech you madam be content <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  if thou that bidst me be content wert grim
    ugly and slandrous to thy mothers womb
    full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
    lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
    patchd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
    i would not care i then would be content
    for then i should not love thee no nor thou
    become thy great birth nor deserve a crown <SENTENCE-END> 
    but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
    nature and fortune joind to make thee great
    of natures gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
    and with the halfblown rose but fortune o
    she is corrupted changd and won from thee
    sh adulterates hourly with thine uncle john  
    and with her golden hand hath pluckd on france
    to tread down fair respect of sovereignty
    and made his majesty the bawd to theirs <SENTENCE-END> 
    france is a bawd to fortune and king john
    that strumpet fortune that usurping john
    tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn

    and leave those woes alone which i alone
    am bound to underbear <SENTENCE-END>

    i may not go without you to the kings <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee
    i will instruct my sorrows to be proud
    for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop <SENTENCE-END> 
    to me and to the state of my great grief
    let kings assemble for my griefs so great
    that no supporter but the huge firm earth
    can hold it up <SENTENCE-END>                      seats herself on the ground
    here i and sorrows sit
    here is my throne bid kings come bow to it <SENTENCE-END>

       elinor the bastard austria and attendants

  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  tis true fair daughter and this blessed day
    ever in france shall be kept festival <SENTENCE-END> 
    to solemnize this day the glorious sun
    stays in his course and plays the alchemist
    turning with splendour of his precious eye
    the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold <SENTENCE-END> 
    the yearly course that brings this day about
    shall never see it but a holiday <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>   rising  a wicked day and not a holy day
    what hath this day deservd what hath it done
    that it in golden letters should be set
    among the high tides in the calendar
    nay rather turn this day out of the week
    this day of shame oppression perjury
    or if it must stand still let wives with child
    pray that their burdens may not fall this day  
    lest that their hopes prodigiously be crossd
    but on this day let seamen fear no wreck
    no bargains break that are not this day made
    this day all things begun come to ill end
    yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven lady you shall have no cause
    to curse the fair proceedings of this day <SENTENCE-END> 
    have i not pawnd to you my majesty
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  you have beguild me with a counterfeit
    resembling majesty which being touchd and tried
    proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
    you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
    but now in arms you strengthen it with yours <SENTENCE-END> 
    the grappling vigour and rough frown of war
    is cold in amity and painted peace
    and our oppression hath made up this league <SENTENCE-END> 
    arm arm you heavens against these perjurd kings
    a widow cries be husband to me heavens
    let not the hours of this ungodly day
    wear out the day in peace but ere sunset  
    set armed discord twixt these perjurd kings
    hear me o hear me
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  lady constance peace
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  war war no peace peace is to me a war <SENTENCE-END> 
    o lymoges o austria thou dost shame
    that bloody spoil <SENTENCE-END>  thou slave thou wretch thou coward
    thou little valiant great in villainy
    thou ever strong upon the stronger side
    thou fortunes champion that dost never fight
    but when her humorous ladyship is by
    to teach thee safety thou art perjurd too
    and soothst up greatness <SENTENCE-END>  what a fool art thou
    a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
    upon my party thou coldblooded slave
    hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
    been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
    upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
    and dost thou now fall over to my foes
    thou wear a lions hide doff it for shame
    and hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs <SENTENCE-END>   
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  o that a man should speak those words to me
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  and hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs <SENTENCE-END> 
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  thou darst not say so villain for thy life <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  and hang a calfsskin on those recreant limbs <SENTENCE-END>

                  enter pandulph

  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  here comes the holy legate of the pope <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  hail you anointed deputies of heaven
    to thee king john my holy errand is <SENTENCE-END> 
    i pandulph of fair milan cardinal
    and from pope innocent the legate here
    do in his name religiously demand
    why thou against the church our holy mother
    so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
    keep stephen langton chosen archbishop
    of canterbury from that holy see
    this in our foresaid holy fathers name
    pope innocent i do demand of thee <SENTENCE-END>   
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  what earthly name to interrogatories
    can task the free breath of a sacred king
    thou canst not cardinal devise a name
    so slight unworthy and ridiculous
    to charge me to an answer as the pope <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell him this tale and from the mouth of england
    add thus much more that no italian priest
    shall tithe or toll in our dominions
    but as we under heaven are supreme head
    so under him that great supremacy
    where we do reign we will alone uphold
    without th assistance of a mortal hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    so tell the pope all reverence set apart
    to him and his usurpd authority <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  brother of england you blaspheme in this <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  though you and all the kings of christendom
    are led so grossly by this meddling priest
    dreading the curse that money may buy out
    and by the merit of vile gold dross dust
    purchase corrupted pardon of a man  
    who in that sale sells pardon from himself
    though you and all the rest so grossly led
    this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
    yet i alone alone do me oppose
    against the pope and count his friends my foes <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  then by the lawful power that i have
    thou shalt stand cursd and excommunicate
    and blessed shall he be that doth revolt
    from his allegiance to an heretic
    and meritorious shall that hand be calld
    canonized and worshippd as a saint
    that takes away by any secret course
    thy hateful life <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  o lawful let it be
    that i have room with rome to curse awhile
    good father cardinal cry thou amen
    to my keen curses for without my wrong
    there is no tongue hath power to curse him right <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  theres law and warrant lady for my curse <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  and for mine too when law can do no right  
    let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
    law cannot give my child his kingdom here
    for he that holds his kingdom holds the law
    therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
    how can the law forbid my tongue to curse
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  philip of france on peril of a curse
    let go the hand of that archheretic
    and raise the power of france upon his head
    unless he do submit himself to rome <SENTENCE-END> 
  elinor <SENTENCE-END>  lookst thou pale france do not let go thy hand <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  look to that devil lest that france repent
    and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul <SENTENCE-END> 
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  king philip listen to the cardinal <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  and hang a calfsskin on his recreant limbs <SENTENCE-END> 
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs
    because
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  your breeches best may carry them <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  philip what sayst thou to the cardinal
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  what should he say but as the cardinal
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  bethink you father for the difference  
    is purchase of a heavy curse from rome
    or the light loss of england for a friend <SENTENCE-END> 
    forgo the easier <SENTENCE-END> 
  blanch <SENTENCE-END>  thats the curse of rome <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  o lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here
    in likeness of a new untrimmed bride <SENTENCE-END> 
  blanch <SENTENCE-END>  the lady constance speaks not from her faith
    but from her need <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  o if thou grant my need
    which only lives but by the death of faith
    that need must needs infer this principle
    that faith would live again by death of need <SENTENCE-END> 
    o then tread down my need and faith mounts up
    keep my need up and faith is trodden down
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  the king is movd and answers not to this <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  o be removd from him and answer well
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  do so king philip hang no more in doubt <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  hang nothing but a calfsskin most sweet lout <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  i am perplexd and know not what to say <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  what canst thou say but will perplex thee more  
    if thou stand excommunicate and cursd
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  good reverend father make my person yours
    and tell me how you would bestow yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
    this royal hand and mine are newly knit
    and the conjunction of our inward souls
    married in league coupled and linkd together
    with all religious strength of sacred vows
    the latest breath that gave the sound of words
    was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
    between our kingdoms and our royal selves
    and even before this truce but new before
    no longer than we well could wash our hands
    to clap this royal bargain up of peace
    heaven knows they were besmeard and overstaind
    with slaughters pencil where revenge did paint
    the fearful difference of incensed kings <SENTENCE-END> 
    and shall these hands so lately purgd of blood
    so newly joind in love so strong in both
    unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
    play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven  
    make such unconstant children of ourselves
    as now again to snatch our palm from palm
    unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
    of smiling peace to march a bloody host
    and make a riot on the gentle brow
    of true sincerity o holy sir
    my reverend father let it not be so
    out of your grace devise ordain impose
    some gentle order and then we shall be blest
    to do your pleasure and continue friends <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  all form is formless order orderless
    save what is opposite to englands love <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore to arms be champion of our church
    or let the church our mother breathe her curse
    a mothers curseon her revolting son <SENTENCE-END> 
    france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
    a chafed lion by the mortal paw
    a fasting tiger safer by the tooth
    than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  i may disjoin my hand but not my faith <SENTENCE-END>   
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  so makst thou faith an enemy to faith
    and like <SENTENCE-END>  a civil war setst oath to oath <SENTENCE-END> 
    thy tongue against thy tongue <SENTENCE-END>  o let thy vow
    first made to heaven first be to heaven performd
    that is to be the champion of our church <SENTENCE-END> 
    what since thou sworst is sworn against thyself
    and may not be performed by thyself
    for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
    is not amiss when it is truly done
    and being not done where doing tends to ill
    the truth is then most done not doing it
    the better act of purposes mistook
    is to mistake again though indirect
    yet indirection thereby grows direct
    and falsehood cures as fire cools fire
    within the scorched veins of one newburnd <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is religion that doth make vows kept
    but thou hast sworn against religion
    by what thou swearst against the thing thou swearst
    and makst an oath the surety for thy truth  
    against an oath the truth thou art unsure
    to swear swears only not to be forsworn
    else what a mockery should it be to swear
    but thou dost swear only to be forsworn
    and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore thy later vows against thy first
    is in thyself rebellion to thyself
    and better conquest never canst thou make
    than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
    against these giddy loose suggestions
    upon which better part our prayrs come in
    if thou vouchsafe them <SENTENCE-END>  but if not then know
    the peril of our curses fight on thee
    so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
    but in despair die under the black weight <SENTENCE-END> 
  austria <SENTENCE-END>  rebellion flat rebellion

  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  what can go well when we have run so ill <SENTENCE-END> 
    are we not beaten is not angiers lost
    arthur taen prisoner divers dear friends slain
    and bloody england into england gone
    oerbearing interruption spite of france
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  he hath won that hath he fortified
    so hot a speed with such advice disposd
    such temperate order in so fierce a cause
    doth want example who hath read or heard
    of any kindred action like to this
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  well could i bear that england had this praise
    so we could find some pattern of our shame <SENTENCE-END>   

                   enter constance

    look who comes here a grave unto a soul
    holding th eternal spirit against her will
    in the vile prison of afflicted breath <SENTENCE-END> 
    i prithee lady go away with me <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  lo now now see the issue of your peace
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  patience good lady comfort gentle constance
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  no i defy all counsel all redress
    but that which ends all counsel true redress
    death death o amiable lovely death
    thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness
    arise forth from the couch of lasting night
    thou hate and terror to prosperity
    and i will kiss thy detestable bones
    and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
    and ring these fingers with thy household worms
    and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
    and be a carrion monster like thyself <SENTENCE-END>   
    come grin on me and i will think thou smilst
    and buss thee as thy wife <SENTENCE-END>  miserys love
    o come to me
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  o fair affliction peace
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  no no i will not having breath to cry <SENTENCE-END> 
    o that my tongue were in the thunders mouth
    then with a passion would i shake the world
    and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
    which cannot hear a ladys feeble voice
    which scorns a modern invocation <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  lady you utter madness and not sorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  thou art not holy to belie me so <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am not mad this hair i tear is mine
    my name is constance i was geffreys wife
    young arthur is my son and he is lost <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am not madi would to heaven i were
    for then tis like i should forget myself <SENTENCE-END> 
    o if i could what grief should i forget
    preach some philosophy to make me mad
    and thou shalt be canonizd cardinal  
    for being not mad but sensible of grief
    my reasonable part produces reason
    how i may be deliverd of these woes
    and teaches me to kill or hang myself <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i were mad i should forget my son
    or madly think a babe of clouts were he <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am not mad too well too well i feel
    the different plague of each calamity <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  bind up those tresses <SENTENCE-END>  o what love i note
    in the fair multitude of those her hairs
    where but by a chance a silver drop hath falln
    even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
    do glue themselves in sociable grief
    like true inseparable faithful loves
    sticking together in calamity <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  to england if you will <SENTENCE-END> 
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  bind up your hairs <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
    i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
    o that these hands could so redeem my son  
    as they have given these hairs their liberty
    but now i envy at their liberty
    and will again commit them to their bonds
    because my poor child is a prisoner <SENTENCE-END> 
    and father cardinal i have heard you say
    that we shall see and know our friends in heaven
    if that be true i shall see my boy again
    for since the birth of cain the first male child
    to him that did but yesterday suspire
    there was not such a gracious creature born <SENTENCE-END> 
    but now will canker sorrow eat my bud
    and chase the native beauty from his cheek
    and he will look as hollow as a ghost
    as dim and meagre as an agues fit
    and so hell die and rising so again
    when i shall meet him in the court of heaven
    i shall not know him <SENTENCE-END>  therefore never never
    must i behold my pretty arthur more <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  you hold too heinous a respect of grief <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  he talks to me that never had a son <SENTENCE-END>   
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  you are as fond of grief as of your child <SENTENCE-END> 
  constance <SENTENCE-END>  grief fills the room up of my absent child
    lies in his bed walks up and down with me
    puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
    remembers me of all his gracious parts
    stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
    then have i reason to be fond of grief <SENTENCE-END> 
    fare you well had you such a loss as i
    i could give better comfort than you do <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will not keep this form upon my head
                                                   tearing her hair
    when there is such disorder in my wit <SENTENCE-END> 
    o lord my boy my arthur my fair son
    my life my joy my food my ail the world
    my widowcomfort and my sorrows cure                      exit
  king philip <SENTENCE-END>  i fear some outrage and ill follow her <SENTENCE-END>          exit
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  theres nothing in this world can make me joy <SENTENCE-END> 
    life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
    vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
    and bitter shame hath spoild the sweet worlds taste  
    that it yields nought but shame and bitterness <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  before the curing of a strong disease
    even in the instant of repair and health
    the fit is strongest evils that take leave
    on their departure most of all show evil
    what have you lost by losing of this day
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  all days of glory joy and happiness <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  if you had won it certainly you had <SENTENCE-END> 
    no no when fortune means to men most good
    she looks upon them with a threatning eye <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis strange to think how much king john hath lost
    in this which he accounts so clearly won <SENTENCE-END> 
    are not you grievd that arthur is his prisoner
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  as heartily as he is glad he hath him <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  your mind is all as youthful as your blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
    for even the breath of what i mean to speak
    shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
    out of the path which shall directly lead
    thy foot to englands throne <SENTENCE-END>  and therefore mark  
    john hath seizd arthur and it cannot be
    that whiles warm life plays in that infants veins
    the misplacd john should entertain an hour
    one minute nay one quiet breath of rest <SENTENCE-END> 
    a sceptre snatchd with an unruly hand
    must be boisterously maintaind as gaind
    and he that stands upon a slippry place
    makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
    that john may stand then arthur needs must fall
    so be it for it cannot be but so <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  but what shall i gain by young arthurs fall
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  you in the right of lady blanch your wife
    may then make all the claim that arthur did <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  and lose it life and all as arthur did <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  how green you are and fresh in this old world
    john lays you plots the times conspire with you
    for he that steeps his safety in true blood
    shall find but bloody safety and untrue <SENTENCE-END> 
    this act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
    of all his people and freeze up their zeal  
    that none so small advantage shall step forth
    to check his reign but they will cherish it
    no natural exhalation in the sky
    no scope of nature no distemperd day
    no common wind no customed event
    but they will pluck away his natural cause
    and call them meteors prodigies and signs
    abortives presages and tongues of heaven
    plainly denouncing vengeance upon john <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  may be he will not touch young arthurs life
    but hold himself safe in his prisonment <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  o sir when he shall hear of your approach
    if that young arthur be not gone already
    even at that news he dies and then the hearts
    of all his people shall revolt from him
    and kiss the lips of unacquainted change
    and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath

  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  mercy on me
    methinks no body should be sad but i
    yet i remember when i was in france
    young gentlemen would be as sad as night
    only for wantonness <SENTENCE-END>  by my christendom
    so i were out of prison and kept sheep
    i should be as merry as the day is long
    and so i would be here but that i doubt
    my uncle practises more harm to me
    he is afraid of me and i of him <SENTENCE-END> 
    is it my fault that i was geffreys son
    no indeed ist not and i would to heaven
    i were your son so you would love me hubert <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>   aside  if i talk to him with his innocent prate
    he will awake my mercy which lies dead
    therefore i will be sudden and dispatch <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  are you sick hubert you look pale today
    in sooth i would you were a little sick
    that i might sit all night and watch with you <SENTENCE-END>   
    i warrant i love you more than you do me <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>   aside  his words do take possession of my bosom <SENTENCE-END> 
    read here young arthur <SENTENCE-END>                         showing a paper
      aside  how now foolish rheum
    turning dispiteous torture out of door
    i must be brief lest resolution drop
    out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    can you not read it is it not fair writ
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  too fairly hubert for so foul effect <SENTENCE-END> 
    must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  young boy i must <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  and will you
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  and i will <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  have you the heart when your head did but ache
    i knit my handkerchief about your brows
    the best i had a princess wrought it me
    and i did never ask it you again
    and with my hand at midnight held your head
    and like the watchful minutes to the hour
    still and anon cheerd up the heavy time  
    saying what lack you and where lies your grief
    or what good love may i perform for you
    many a poor mans son would have lyen still
    and neer have spoke a loving word to you
    but you at your sick service had a prince <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay you may think my love was crafty love
    and call it cunning <SENTENCE-END>  do an if you will <SENTENCE-END> 
    if heaven be pleasd that you must use me ill
    why then you must <SENTENCE-END>  will you put out mine eyes
    these eyes that never did nor never shall
    so much as frown on you
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  i have sworn to do it
    and with hot irons must i burn them out <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  ah none but in this iron age would do it
    the iron of itself though heat redhot
    approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
    and quench his fiery indignation
    even in the matter of mine innocence
    nay after that consume away in rust
    but for containing fire to harm mine eye <SENTENCE-END>   
    are you more stubbornhard than hammerd iron
    an if an angel should have come to me
    and told me hubert should put out mine eyes
    i would not have believd himno tongue but huberts <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>   stamps  come forth <SENTENCE-END>

    whatever torment you do put me to <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  go stand within let me alone with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  executioner <SENTENCE-END>  i am best pleasd to be from such a deed <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                  exeunt executioners
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  alas i then have chid away my friend

    give life to yours <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  come boy prepare yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  is there no remedy
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  none but to lose your eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  o heaven that there were but a mote in yours
    a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
    any annoyance in that precious sense
    then feeling what small things are boisterous there
    your vile intent must needs seem horrible <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  is this your promise go to hold your tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
    must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert  
    or hubert if you will cut out my tongue
    so i may keep mine eyes <SENTENCE-END>  o spare mine eyes
    though to no use but still to look on you
    lo by my troth the instrument is cold
    and would not harm me <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  i can heat it boy <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
    being create for comfort to be usd
    in undeserved extremes <SENTENCE-END>  see else yourself
    there is no malice in this burning coal
    the breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
    and strewd repentant ashes on his head <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  but with my breath i can revive it boy <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  an if you do you will but make it blush
    and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
    and like a dog that is compelld to fight
    snatch at his master that doth tarre him on <SENTENCE-END> 
    all things that you should use to do me wrong
    deny their office only you do lack  
    that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
    creatures of note for mercylacking uses <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  well see to live i will not touch thine eye
    for all the treasure that thine uncle owes <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet i am sworn and i did purpose boy
    with this same very iron to burn them out <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  o now you look like hubert all this while
    you were disguisd <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  peace no more <SENTENCE-END>  adieu <SENTENCE-END> 
    your uncle must not know but you are dead
    ill fill these dogged spies with false reports
    and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
    that hubert for the wealth of all the world
    will not offend thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  arthur <SENTENCE-END>  o heaven i thank you hubert <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  silence no more <SENTENCE-END>  go closely in with me <SENTENCE-END> 
    much danger do i undergo for thee <SENTENCE-END>                          exeunt




scene 2 <SENTENCE-END> 

england <SENTENCE-END>  king johns palace

enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords

  king john <SENTENCE-END>  here once again we sit once again crownd
    and lookd upon i hope with cheerful eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  this once again but that your highness pleasd
    was once superfluous you were crownd before
    and that high royalty was neer pluckd off
    the faiths of men neer stained with revolt
    fresh expectation troubled not the land
    with any longdfor change or better state <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  therefore to be possessd with double pomp
    to guard a title that was rich before
    to gild refined gold to paint the lily
    to throw a perfume on the violet
    to smooth the ice or add another hue
    unto the rainbow or with taperlight
    to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
    is wasteful and ridiculous excess <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  but that your royal pleasure must be done
    this act is as an ancient tale new told  
    and in the last repeating troublesome
    being urged at a time unseasonable <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  in this the antique and wellnoted face
    of plain old form is much disfigured
    and like a shifted wind unto a sail
    it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
    startles and frights consideration
    makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
    for putting on so new a fashiond robe <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  when workmen strive to do better than well
    they do confound their skill in covetousness
    and oftentimes excusing of a fault
    doth make the fault the worse by th excuse
    as patches set upon a little breach
    discredit more in hiding of the fault
    than did the fault before it was so patchd <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  to this effect before you were newcrownd
    we breathd our counsel but it pleasd your highness
    to overbear it and we are all well pleasd
    since all and every part of what we would  
    doth make a stand at what your highness will <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  some reasons of this double coronation
    i have possessd you with and think them strong
    and more more strong when lesser is my fear
    i shall indue you with <SENTENCE-END>  meantime but ask
    what you would have reformd that is not well
    and well shall you perceive how willingly
    i will both hear and grant you your requests <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  then i as one that am the tongue of these
    to sound the purposes of all their hearts
    both for myself and them but chief of all
    your safety for the which myself and them
    bend their best studies heartily request
    th enfranchisement of arthur whose restraint
    doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
    to break into this dangerous argument
    if what in rest you have in right you hold
    why then your fearswhich as they say attend
    the steps of wrongshould move you to mew up
    your tender kinsman and to choke his days  
    with barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
    the rich advantage of good exercise
    that the times enemies may not have this
    to grace occasions let it be our suit
    that you have bid us ask his liberty
    which for our goods we do no further ask
    than whereupon our weal on you depending
    counts it your weal he have his liberty <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  let it be so <SENTENCE-END>  i do commit his youth
    to your direction <SENTENCE-END> 

                     enter hubert

    aside  hubert what news with you
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  this is the man should do the bloody deed
    he showd his warrant to a friend of mine
    the image of a wicked heinous fault
    lives in his eye that close aspect of his
    doth show the mood of a much troubled breast
    and i do fearfully believe tis done  
    what we so feard he had a charge to do <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  the colour of the king doth come and go
    between his purpose and his conscience
    like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set <SENTENCE-END> 
    his passion is so ripe it needs must break <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  and when it breaks i fear will issue thence
    the foul corruption of a sweet childs death <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  we cannot hold mortalitys strong hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    good lords although my will to give is living
    the suit which you demand is gone and dead
    he tells us arthur is deceasd tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  indeed we feard his sickness was past cure <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  indeed we heard how near his death he was
    before the child himself felt he was sick <SENTENCE-END> 
    this must be answerd either here or hence <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  why do you bend such solemn brows on me
    think you i bear the shears of destiny
    have i commandment on the pulse of life
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  it is apparent foulplay and tis shame
    that greatness should so grossly offer it <SENTENCE-END>   
    so thrive it in your game and so farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  stay yet lord salisbury ill go with thee
    and find th inheritance of this poor child
    his little kingdom of a forced grave <SENTENCE-END> 
    that blood which owd the breadth of all this isle
    three foot of it doth holdbad world the while
    this must not be thus borne this will break out
    to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt <SENTENCE-END>             exeunt lords
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  they burn in indignation <SENTENCE-END>  i repent <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is no sure foundation set on blood
    no certain life achievd by others death <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter a messenger

    for any foreign preparation

    for when you should be told they do prepare
    the tidings comes that they are all arrivd <SENTENCE-END>

    now what says the world

    my head with more ill news for it is fun <SENTENCE-END>

    then let the worst unheard fall on your head <SENTENCE-END>

  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  how i have sped among the clergymen
    the sums i have collected shall express <SENTENCE-END> 
    but as i travelld hither through the land
    i find the people strangely fantasied
    possessd with rumours full of idle dreams <SENTENCE-END>   
    not knowing what they fear but full of fear
    and heres a prophet that i brought with me
    from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found
    with many hundreds treading on his heels
    to whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
    that ere the next ascensionday at noon
    your highness should deliver up your crown <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
  peter <SENTENCE-END>  foreknowing that the truth will fall out so <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  hubert away with him imprison him
    and on that day at noon whereon he says
    i shall yield up my crown let him be hangd <SENTENCE-END> 
    deliver him to safety and return
    for i must use thee <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               exit hubert with peter
    o my gentle cousin
    hearst thou the news abroad who are arrivd
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  the french my lord mens mouths are full of it
    besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury
    with eyes as red as newenkindled fire  
    and others more going to seek the grave
    of arthur whom they say is killd tonight
    on your suggestion <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  gentle kinsman go
    and thrust thyself into their companies <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have a way to will their loves again

    and fly like thought from them to me again <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  the spirit of the time shall teach me speed <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman <SENTENCE-END>

  king john <SENTENCE-END>  my mother dead

                   reenter hubert

  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  my lord they say five moons were seen tonight
    four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
    the other four in wondrous motion <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  five moons
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  old men and beldams in the streets
    do prophesy upon it dangerously
    young arthurs death is common in their mouths
    and when they talk of him they shake their heads
    and whisper one another in the ear
    and he that speaks doth gripe the hearers wrist
    whilst he that hears makes fearful action
    with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
    the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
    with open mouth swallowing a tailors news  
    who with his shears and measure in his hand
    standing on slippers which his nimble haste
    had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
    told of a many thousand warlike french
    that were embattailed and rankd in kent <SENTENCE-END> 
    another lean unwashd artificer
    cuts off his tale and talks of arthurs death <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  why seekst thou to possess me with these fears
    why urgest thou so oft young arthurs death
    thy hand hath murdred him <SENTENCE-END>  i had a mighty cause
    to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  no had my lord why did you not provoke me
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  it is the curse of kings to be attended
    by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
    to break within the bloody house of life
    and on the winking of authority
    to understand a law to know the meaning
    of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
    more upon humour than advisd respect <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  here is your hand and seal for what i did <SENTENCE-END>   
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  o when the last account twixt heaven and earth
    is to be made then shall this hand and seal
    witness against us to damnation
    how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
    make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by
    a fellow by the hand of nature markd
    quoted and signd to do a deed of shame
    this murder had not come into my mind
    but taking note of thy abhorrd aspect
    finding thee fit for bloody villainy
    apt liable to be employd in danger
    i faintly broke with thee of arthurs death
    and thou to be endeared to a king
    made it no conscience to destroy a prince <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
    when i spake darkly what i purposed
    or turnd an eye of doubt upon my face
    as bid me tell my tale in express words
    deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off  
    and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me <SENTENCE-END> 
    but thou didst understand me by my signs
    and didst in signs again parley with sin
    yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
    and consequently thy rude hand to act
    the deed which both our tongues held vile to name <SENTENCE-END> 
    out of my sight and never see me more
    my nobles leave me and my state is braved
    even at my gates with ranks of foreign powrs
    nay in the body of the fleshly land
    this kingdom this confine of blood and breath
    hostility and civil tumult reigns
    between my conscience and my cousins death <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  arm you against your other enemies
    ill make a peace between your soul and you <SENTENCE-END> 
    young arthur is alive <SENTENCE-END>  this hand of mine
    is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
    not painted with the crimson spots of blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    within this bosom never entred yet
    the dreadful motion of a murderous thought  
    and you have slanderd nature in my form
    which howsoever rude exteriorly
    is yet the cover of a fairer mind
    than to be butcher of an innocent child <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers
    throw this report on their incensed rage
    and make them tame to their obedience
    forgive the comment that my passion made
    upon thy feature for my rage was blind
    and foul imaginary eyes of blood
    presented thee more hideous than thou art <SENTENCE-END> 
    o answer not but to my closet bring
    the angry lords with all expedient haste <SENTENCE-END>

  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
    the earth had not a hole to hide this deed <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  murder as hating what himself hath done
    doth lay it open to urge on revenge <SENTENCE-END> 
  bigot <SENTENCE-END>  or when he doomd this beauty to a grave
    found it too preciousprincely for a grave <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  sir richard what think you have you beheld
    or have you read or heard or could you think
    or do you almost think although you see
    that you do see could thought without this object
    form such another this is the very top
    the height the crest or crest unto the crest
    of murders arms this is the bloodiest shame
    the wildest savagery the vilest stroke
    that ever walleyd wrath or staring rage  
    presented to the tears of soft remorse <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  all murders past do stand excusd in this
    and this so sole and so unmatchable

    to the yet unbegotten sin of times
    and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
    exampled by this heinous spectacle <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  it is a damned and a bloody work
    the graceless action of a heavy hand
    if that it be the work of any hand <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  if that it be the work of any hand
    we had a kind of light what would ensue <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is the shameful work of huberts hand
    the practice and the purpose of the king
    from whose obedience i forbid my soul
    kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
    and breathing to his breathless excellence
    the incense of a vow a holy vow
    never to taste the pleasures of the world
    never to be infected with delight  
    nor conversant with ease and idleness
    till i have set a glory to this hand
    by giving it the worship of revenge <SENTENCE-END> 
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  and bigot <SENTENCE-END>  our souls religiously confirm thy words <SENTENCE-END>

  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  upon my soul
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  if thou didst but consent
    to this most cruel act do but despair
    and if thou wantst a cord the smallest thread
    that ever spider twisted from her womb
    will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
    to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
    put but a little water in a spoon
    and it shall be as all the ocean
    enough to stifle such a villain up
    i do suspect thee very grievously <SENTENCE-END> 
  hubert <SENTENCE-END>  if i in act consent or sin of thought
    be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
    which was embounded in this beauteous clay

    how easy dost thou take all england up
    from forth this morsel of dead royalty
    the life the right and truth of all this realm
    is fled to heaven and england now is left
    to tug and scamble and to part by th teeth
    the unowed interest of proudswelling state <SENTENCE-END> 
    now for the barepickd bone of majesty
    doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
    and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
    now powers from home and discontents at home
    meet in one line and vast confusion waits
    as doth a raven on a sickfalln beast
    the imminent decay of wrested pomp <SENTENCE-END> 
    now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
    hold out this tempest <SENTENCE-END>  bear away that child
    and follow me with speed <SENTENCE-END>  ill to the king
    a thousand businesses are brief in hand  
    and heaven itself doth frown upon the land <SENTENCE-END>                 exeunt

    the circle of my glory <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>   gives back the crown  take again
    from this my hand as holding of the pope
    your sovereign greatness and authority <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  now keep your holy word go meet the french
    and from his holiness use all your power
    to stop their marches fore we are inflamd <SENTENCE-END> 
    our discontented counties do revolt
    our people quarrel with obedience
    swearing allegiance and the love of soul
    to stranger blood to foreign royalty <SENTENCE-END> 
    this inundation of mistempred humour
    rests by you only to be qualified <SENTENCE-END> 
    then pause not for the present times so sick
    that present medcine must be ministred  
    or overthrow incurable ensues <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  it was my breath that blew this tempest up
    upon your stubborn usage of the pope
    but since you are a gentle convertite
    my tongue shall hush again this storm of war
    and make fair weather in your blustring land <SENTENCE-END> 
    on this ascensionday remember well
    upon your oath of service to the pope
    go i to make the french lay down their arms <SENTENCE-END>                  exit
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  is this ascensionday did not the prophet
    say that before ascensionday at noon
    my crown i should give off even so i have <SENTENCE-END> 
    i did suppose it should be on constraint
    but heaven be thankd it is but voluntary <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter the bastard

  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
    but dover castle <SENTENCE-END>  london hath receivd
    like a kind host the dauphin and his powers <SENTENCE-END>   
    your nobles will not hear you but are gone
    to offer service to your enemy
    and wild amazement hurries up and down
    the little number of your doubtful friends <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  would not my lords return to me again
    after they heard young arthur was alive
    bastard <SENTENCE-END>  they found him dead and cast into the streets
    an empty casket where the jewel of life
    by some damnd hand was robbed and taen away <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  that villain hubert told me he did live <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  so on my soul he did for aught he knew <SENTENCE-END> 
    but wherefore do you droop why look you sad
    be great in act as you have been in thought
    let not the world see fear and sad distrust
    govern the motion of a kingly eye <SENTENCE-END> 
    be stirring as the time be fire with fire
    threaten the threatner and outface the brow
    of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
    that borrow their behaviours from the great
    grow great by your example and put on  
    the dauntless spirit of resolution <SENTENCE-END> 
    away and glister like the god of war
    when he intendeth to become the field
    show boldness and aspiring confidence <SENTENCE-END> 
    what shall they seek the lion in his den
    and fright him there and make him tremble there
    o let it not be said forage and run
    to meet displeasure farther from the doors
    and grapple with him ere he come so nigh <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  the legate of the pope hath been with me
    and i have made a happy peace with him
    and he hath promisd to dismiss the powers
    led by the dauphin <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  o inglorious league
    shall we upon the footing of our land
    send fairplay orders and make compromise
    insinuation parley and base truce
    to arms invasive shall a beardless boy
    a cockred silken wanton brave our fields
    and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil  
    mocking the air with colours idly spread
    and find no check let us my liege to arms <SENTENCE-END> 
    perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace
    or if he do let it at least be said
    they saw we had a purpose of defence <SENTENCE-END> 
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  have thou the ordering of this present time <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  away then with good courage
    yet i know
    our party may well meet a prouder foe <SENTENCE-END>                      exeunt

england <SENTENCE-END>  the dauphins camp at saint edmundsbury

enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke bigot and soldiers

  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  my lord melun let this be copied out
    and keep it safe for our remembrance
    return the precedent to these lords again
    that having our fair order written down
    both they and we perusing oer these notes
    may know wherefore we took the sacrament
    and keep our faiths firm and inviolable <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  upon our sides it never shall be broken <SENTENCE-END> 
    and noble dauphin albeit we swear
    a voluntary zeal and an unurgd faith
    to your proceedings yet believe me prince
    i am not glad that such a sore of time
    should seek a plaster by contemnd revolt
    and heal the inveterate canker of one wound
    by making many <SENTENCE-END>  o it grieves my soul  
    that i must draw this metal from my side
    to be a widowmaker o and there
    where honourable rescue and defence
    cries out upon the name of salisbury
    but such is the infection of the time
    that for the health and physic of our right
    we cannot deal but with the very hand
    of stern injustice and confused wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
    and ist not pity o my grieved friends
    that we the sons and children of this isle
    were born to see so sad an hour as this
    wherein we step after a strangermarch
    upon her gentle bosom and fill up
    her enemies ranksi must withdraw and weep
    upon the spot of this enforced cause
    to grace the gentry of a land remote
    and follow unacquainted colours here
    what here o nation that thou couldst remove
    that neptunes arms who clippeth thee about
    would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself  
    and grapple thee unto a pagan shore
    where these two christian armies might combine
    the blood of malice in a vein of league
    and not to spend it so unneighbourly
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  a noble temper dost thou show in this
    and great affections wrestling in thy bosom
    doth make an earthquake of nobility <SENTENCE-END> 
    o what a noble combat hast thou fought
    between compulsion and a brave respect
    let me wipe off this honourable dew
    that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks <SENTENCE-END> 
    my heart hath melted at a ladys tears
    being an ordinary inundation
    but this effusion of such manly drops
    this showr blown up by tempest of the soul
    startles mine eyes and makes me more amazd
    than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven
    figurd quite oer with burning meteors <SENTENCE-END> 
    lift up thy brow renowned salisbury
    and with a great heart heave away this storm  
    commend these waters to those baby eyes
    that never saw the giant world enragd
    nor met with fortune other than at feasts
    full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping <SENTENCE-END> 
    come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
    into the purse of rich prosperity
    as lewis himself <SENTENCE-END>  so nobles shall you all
    that knit your sinews to the strength of mine <SENTENCE-END> 

                enter pandulph

    and even there methinks an angel spake
    look where the holy legate comes apace
    to give us warrant from the hand of heaven
    and on our actions set the name of right
    with holy breath <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  hail noble prince of france
    the next is this king john hath reconcild
    himself to rome his spirit is come in
    that so stood out against the holy church  
    the great metropolis and see of rome <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore thy threatning colours now wind up
    and tame the savage spirit of wild war
    that like a lion fostered up at hand
    it may lie gently at the foot of peace
    and be no further harmful than in show <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  your grace shall pardon me i will not back
    i am too highborn to be propertied
    to be a secondary at control
    or useful servingman and instrument
    to any sovereign state throughout the world <SENTENCE-END> 
    your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
    between this chastisd kingdom and myself
    and brought in matter that should feed this fire
    and now tis far too huge to be blown out
    with that same weak wind which enkindled it <SENTENCE-END> 
    you taught me how to know the face of right
    acquainted me with interest to this land
    yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
    and come ye now to tell me john hath made  
    his peace with rome what is that peace to me
    i by the honour of my marriagebed
    after young arthur claim this land for mine
    and now it is halfconquerd must i back
    because that john hath made his peace with rome
    am i romes slave what penny hath rome borne
    what men provided what munition sent
    to underprop this action is t not i
    that undergo this charge who else but i
    and such as to my claim are liable
    sweat in this business and maintain this war
    have i not heard these islanders shout out
    vive le roi as i have bankd their towns
    have i not here the best cards for the game
    to will this easy match playd for a crown
    and shall i now give oer the yielded set
    no no on my soul it never shall be said <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  you look but on the outside of this work <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  outside or inside i will not return
    till my attempt so much be glorified  
    as to my ample hope was promised
    before i drew this gallant head of war
    and culld these fiery spirits from the world
    to outlook conquest and to will renown
    even in the jaws of danger and of death <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                     trumpet sounds
    what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us

             enter the bastard attended

  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  according to the fair play of the world
    let me have audience i am sent to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    my holy lord of milan from the king
    i come to learn how you have dealt for him
    and as you answer i do know the scope
    and warrant limited unto my tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  the dauphin is too wilfulopposite
    and will not temporize with my entreaties
    he flatly says hell not lay down his arms <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  by all the blood that ever fury breathd  
    the youth says well <SENTENCE-END>  now hear our english king
    for thus his royalty doth speak in me <SENTENCE-END> 
    he is prepard and reason too he should <SENTENCE-END> 
    this apish and unmannerly approach
    this harnessd masque and unadvised revel
    this unhaird sauciness and boyish troops
    the king doth smile at and is well prepard
    to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
    from out the circle of his territories <SENTENCE-END> 
    that hand which had the strength even at your door <SENTENCE-END> 
    to cudgel you and make you take the hatch
    to dive like buckets in concealed wells
    to crouch in litter of your stable planks
    to lie like pawns lockd up in chests and trunks
    to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
    in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
    even at the crying of your nations crow
    thinking this voice an armed englishman
    shall that victorious hand be feebled here
    that in your chambers gave you chastisement  
    no <SENTENCE-END>  know the gallant monarch is in arms
    and like an eagle oer his aery towrs
    to souse annoyance that comes near his nest <SENTENCE-END> 
    and you degenerate you ingrate revolts
    you bloody neroes ripping up the womb
    of your dear mother england blush for shame
    for your own ladies and palevisagd maids
    like amazons come tripping after drums
    their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
    their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
    to fierce and bloody inclination <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
    we grant thou canst outscold us <SENTENCE-END>  fare thee well
    we hold our time too precious to be spent
    with such a brabbler <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandulph <SENTENCE-END>  give me leave to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  no i will speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  we will attend to neither <SENTENCE-END> 
    strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
    plead for our interest and our being here <SENTENCE-END>   
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
    and so shall you being beaten <SENTENCE-END>  do but start
    and echo with the clamour of thy drum
    and even at hand a drum is ready bracd
    that shall reverberate all as loud as thine
    sound but another and another shall
    as loud as thine rattle the welkins ear
    and mock the deepmouthd thunder for at hand
    not trusting to this halting legate here
    whom he hath usd rather for sport than need
    is warlike john and in his forehead sits
    a bareribbd death whose office is this day
    to feast upon whole thousands of the french <SENTENCE-END> 
  lewis <SENTENCE-END>  strike up our drums to find this danger out <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt <SENTENCE-END>

    why should i then be false since it is true
    that i must die here and live hence by truth
    i say again if lewis do will the day
    he is forsworn if eer those eyes of yours
    behold another day break in the east  
    but even this night whose black contagious breath
    already smokes about the burning crest
    of the old feeble and daywearied sun

    paying the fine of rated treachery
    even with a treacherous fine of all your lives <SENTENCE-END> 
    if lewis by your assistance win the day <SENTENCE-END>

    the love of himand this respect besides
    for that my grandsire was an englishman
    awakes my conscience to confess all this <SENTENCE-END> 
    in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence
    from forth the noise and rumour of the field
    where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
    in peace and part this body and my soul
    with contemplation and devout desires <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  we do believe thee and beshrew my soul
    but i do love the favour and the form
    of this most fair occasion by the which
    we will untread the steps of damned flight  
    and like a bated and retired flood
    leaving our rankness and irregular course
    stoop low within those bounds we have oerlookd
    and calmly run on in obedience
    even to our ocean to great king john <SENTENCE-END> 
    my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
    for i do see the cruel pangs of death
    right in thine eye <SENTENCE-END>  away my friends new flight
    and happy newness that intends old right <SENTENCE-END>

the orchard at swinstead abbey

enter prince henry salisbury and bigot

  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  it is too late the life of all his blood
    is touchd corruptibly and his pure brain <SENTENCE-END> 
    which some suppose the souls frail dwellinghouse
    doth by the idle comments that it makes
    foretell the ending of mortality <SENTENCE-END> 

                   enter pembroke

  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  his highness yet doth speak and holds belief
    that being brought into the open air
    it would allay the burning quality
    of that fell poison which assaileth him <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  let him be brought into the orchard here <SENTENCE-END> 
    doth he still rage                                    exit bigot
  pembroke <SENTENCE-END>  he is more patient
    than when you left him even now he sung <SENTENCE-END>   
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  o vanity of sickness fierce extremes
    in their continuance will not feel themselves <SENTENCE-END> 
    death having preyd upon the outward parts
    leaves them invisible and his siege is now
    against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
    with many legions of strange fantasies
    which in their throng and press to that last hold
    confound themselves <SENTENCE-END>  tis strange that death should sing <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
    who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
    and from the organpipe of frailty sings
    his soul and body to their lasting rest <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  be of good comfort prince for you are born
    to set a form upon that indigest
    which he hath left so shapeless and so rude <SENTENCE-END> 

       reenter bigot and attendants who bring in
                king john in a chair

  king john <SENTENCE-END>  ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom  
    it would not out at windows nor at doors <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is so hot a summer in my bosom
    that all my bowels crumble up to dust <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
    upon a parchment and against this fire
    do i shrink up <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  how fares your majesty
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  poisondillfare dead forsook cast off
    and none of you will bid the winter come
    to thrust his icy fingers in my maw
    nor let my kingdoms rivers take their course
    through my burnd bosom nor entreat the north
    to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
    and comfort me with cold <SENTENCE-END>  i do not ask you much
    i beg cold comfort and you are so strait
    and so ingrateful you deny me that <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  o that there were some virtue in my tears
    that might relieve you
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  the salt in them is hot <SENTENCE-END> 
    within me is a hell and there the poison  
    is as a fiend confind to tyrannize
    on unreprievable condemned blood <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter the bastard

  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  o i am scalded with my violent motion
    and spleen of speed to see your majesty
  king john <SENTENCE-END>  o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
    the tackle of my heart is crackd and burnt
    and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
    are turned to one thread one little hair
    my heart hath one poor string to stay it by
    which holds but till thy news be uttered
    and then all this thou seest is but a clod
    and module of confounded royalty <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  the dauphin is preparing hitherward
    where god he knows how we shall answer him
    for in a night the best part of my powr
    as i upon advantage did remove
    were in the washes all unwarily  
    devoured by the unexpected flood <SENTENCE-END>                  the king dies
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear <SENTENCE-END> 
    my liege my lord but now a kingnow thus <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  even so must i run on and even so stop <SENTENCE-END> 
    what surety of the world what hope what stay
    when this was now a king and now is clay
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  art thou gone so i do but stay behind
    to do the office for thee of revenge
    and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
    as it on earth hath been thy servant still <SENTENCE-END> 
    now now you stars that move in your right spheres
    where be your powrs show now your mended faiths
    and instantly return with me again
    to push destruction and perpetual shame
    out of the weak door of our fainting land <SENTENCE-END> 
    straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
    the dauphin rages at our very heels <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  it seems you know not then so much as we
    the cardinal pandulph is within at rest
    who half an hour since came from the dauphin  
    and brings from him such offers of our peace
    as we with honour and respect may take
    with purpose presently to leave this war <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  he will the rather do it when he sees
    ourselves well sinewed to our defence <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  nay tis in a manner done already
    for many carriages he hath dispatchd
    to the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
    to the disposing of the cardinal
    with whom yourself myself and other lords
    if you think meet this afternoon will post
    to consummate this business happily <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  let it be so <SENTENCE-END>  and you my noble prince
    with other princes that may best be spard
    shall wait upon your fathers funeral <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  at worcester must his body be interrd
    for so he willd it <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  thither shall it then
    and happily may your sweet self put on
    the lineal state and glory of the land  
    to whom with all submission on my knee
    i do bequeath my faithful services
    and true subjection everlastingly <SENTENCE-END> 
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  and the like tender of our love we make
    to rest without a spot for evermore <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince henry <SENTENCE-END>  i have a kind soul that would give you thanks
    and knows not how to do it but with tears <SENTENCE-END> 
  bastard <SENTENCE-END>  o let us pay the time but needful woe
    since it hath been beforehand with our griefs <SENTENCE-END> 
    this england never did nor never shall
    lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
    but when it first did help to wound itself <SENTENCE-END> 
    now these her princes are come home again
    come the three corners of the world in arms
    and we shall shock them <SENTENCE-END>  nought shall make us rue
    if england to itself do rest but true <SENTENCE-END>                      exeunt

  second commoner <SENTENCE-END>  a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe
    conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles <SENTENCE-END>

  second commoner <SENTENCE-END>  nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet
    if you be out sir i can mend you <SENTENCE-END>   
  marullus <SENTENCE-END>  what meanst thou by that mend me thou saucy fellow
  second commoner <SENTENCE-END>  why sir cobble you <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  thou art a cobbler art thou
  second commoner <SENTENCE-END>  truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i
    meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with
    awl <SENTENCE-END>  i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in
    great danger i recover them <SENTENCE-END>  as proper men as ever trod upon
    neats leather have gone upon my handiwork <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  but wherefore art not in thy shop today
    why dost thou lead these men about the streets
  second commoner <SENTENCE-END>  truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
    into more work <SENTENCE-END>  but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar
    and to rejoice in his triumph <SENTENCE-END> 
  marullus <SENTENCE-END>  wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home
    what tributaries follow him to rome
    to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
    you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
    o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome
    knew you not pompey many a time and oft
    have you climbd up to walls and battlements  
    to towers and windows yea to chimney tops
    your infants in your arms and there have sat
    the livelong day with patient expectation
    to see great pompey pass the streets of rome <SENTENCE-END> 
    and when you saw his chariot but appear
    have you not made an universal shout
    that tiber trembled underneath her banks
    to hear the replication of your sounds
    made in her concave shores
    and do you now put on your best attire
    and do you now cull out a holiday
    and do you now strew flowers in his way
    that comes in triumph over pompeys blood
    be gone
    run to your houses fall upon your knees
    pray to the gods to intermit the plague
    that needs must light on this ingratitude <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  go go good countrymen and for this fault
    assemble all the poor men of your sort
    draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears  
    into the channel till the lowest stream
    do kiss the most exalted shores of all <SENTENCE-END> 
                                           exeunt all commoners <SENTENCE-END> 
    see whether their basest metal be not moved
    they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness <SENTENCE-END> 
    go you down that way towards the capitol
    this way will i <SENTENCE-END>  disrobe the images
    if you do find them deckd with ceremonies <SENTENCE-END> 
  marullus <SENTENCE-END>  may we do so
    you know it is the feast of lupercal <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  it is no matter let no images
    be hung with caesars trophies <SENTENCE-END>  ill about
    and drive away the vulgar from the streets
    so do you too where you perceive them thick <SENTENCE-END> 
    these growing feathers pluckd from caesars wing
    will make him fly an ordinary pitch
    who else would soar above the view of men
    and keep us all in servile fearfulness <SENTENCE-END>               exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

    of that quick spirit that is in antony <SENTENCE-END>   
    let me not hinder cassius your desires
    ill leave you <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  brutus i do observe you now of late
    i have not from your eyes that gentleness
    and show of love as i was wont to have
    you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
    over your friend that loves you <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  cassius
    be not deceived if i have veild my look
    i turn the trouble of my countenance
    merely upon myself <SENTENCE-END>  vexed i am
    of late with passions of some difference
    conceptions only proper to myself
    which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
    but let not therefore my good friends be grieved
    among which number cassius be you one
    nor construe any further my neglect
    than that poor brutus with himself at war
    forgets the shows of love to other men <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  then brutus i have much mistook your passion  
    by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
    thoughts of great value worthy cogitations <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell me good brutus can you see your face
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  no cassius for the eye sees not itself
    but by reflection by some other things <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  tis just
    and it is very much lamented brutus
    that you have no such mirrors as will turn
    your hidden worthiness into your eye
    that you might see your shadow <SENTENCE-END>  i have heard
    where many of the best respect in rome
    except immortal caesar speaking of brutus
    and groaning underneath this ages yoke
    have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  into what dangers would you lead me cassius
    that you would have me seek into myself
    for that which is not in me
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  therefore good brutus be prepared to hear
    and since you know you cannot see yourself
    so well as by reflection i your glass  
    will modestly discover to yourself
    that of yourself which you yet know not of <SENTENCE-END> 
    and be not jealous on me gentle brutus
    were i a common laugher or did use
    to stale with ordinary oaths my love
    to every new protester if you know
    that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
    and after scandal them or if you know
    that i profess myself in banqueting
    to all the rout then hold me dangerous <SENTENCE-END> 
                                             flourish and shout <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what means this shouting i do fear the people
    choose caesar for their king <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  ay do you fear it
    then must i think you would not have it so <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i would not cassius yet i love him well <SENTENCE-END> 
    but wherefore do you hold me here so long
    what is it that you would impart to me
    if it be aught toward the general good
    set honor in one eye and death i the other  
    and i will look on both indifferently <SENTENCE-END> 
    for let the gods so speed me as i love
    the name of honor more than i fear death <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i know that virtue to be in you brutus
    as well as i do know your outward favor <SENTENCE-END> 
    well honor is the subject of my story <SENTENCE-END> 
    i cannot tell what you and other men
    think of this life but for my single self
    i had as lief not be as live to be
    in awe of such a thing as i myself <SENTENCE-END> 
    i was born free as caesar so were you
    we both have fed as well and we can both
    endure the winters cold as well as he <SENTENCE-END> 
    for once upon a raw and gusty day
    the troubled tiber chafing with her shores
    caesar said to me darest thou cassius now
    leap in with me into this angry flood
    and swim to yonder point upon the word
    accoutred as i was i plunged in
    and bade him follow <SENTENCE-END>  so indeed he did <SENTENCE-END>   
    the torrent roard and we did buffet it
    with lusty sinews throwing it aside
    and stemming it with hearts of controversy <SENTENCE-END> 
    but ere we could arrive the point proposed
    caesar cried help me cassius or i sink
    i as aeneas our great ancestor
    did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
    the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber
    did i the tired caesar <SENTENCE-END>  and this man
    is now become a god and cassius is
    a wretched creature and must bend his body
    if caesar carelessly but nod on him <SENTENCE-END> 
    he had a fever when he was in spain
    and when the fit was on him i did mark
    how he did shake <SENTENCE-END>  tis true this god did shake
    his coward lips did from their color fly
    and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    did lose his luster <SENTENCE-END>  i did hear him groan <SENTENCE-END> 
    ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans
    mark him and write his speeches in their books  
    alas it cried give me some drink titinius
    as a sick girl <SENTENCE-END>  ye gods it doth amaze me
    a man of such a feeble temper should
    so get the start of the majestic world
    and bear the palm alone <SENTENCE-END>  shout <SENTENCE-END>                     flourish <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  another general shout
    i do believe that these applauses are
    for some new honors that are heapd on caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  why man he doth bestride the narrow world
    like a colossus and we petty men
    walk under his huge legs and peep about
    to find ourselves dishonorable graves <SENTENCE-END> 
    men at some time are masters of their fates
    the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
    but in ourselves that we are underlings <SENTENCE-END> 
    brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar
    why should that name be sounded more than yours
    write them together yours is as fair a name
    sound them it doth become the mouth as well
    weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em  
    brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    now in the names of all the gods at once
    upon what meat doth this our caesar feed
    that he is grown so great age thou art shamed
    rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
    when went there by an age since the great flood
    but it was famed with more than with one man
    when could they say till now that talkd of rome
    that her wide walls encompassd but one man
    now is it rome indeed and room enough
    when there is in it but one only man <SENTENCE-END> 
    o you and i have heard our fathers say
    there was a brutus once that would have brookd
    the eternal devil to keep his state in rome
    as easily as a king <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  that you do love me i am nothing jealous
    what you would work me to i have some aim <SENTENCE-END> 
    how i have thought of this and of these times
    i shall recount hereafter for this present
    i would not so with love i might entreat you  
    be any further moved <SENTENCE-END>  what you have said
    i will consider what you have to say
    i will with patience hear and find a time
    both meet to hear and answer such high things <SENTENCE-END> 
    till then my noble friend chew upon this
    brutus had rather be a villager
    than to repute himself a son of rome
    under these hard conditions as this time
    is like to lay upon us <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i am glad that my weak words
    have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus <SENTENCE-END> 

            reenter caesar and his train <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  the games are done and caesar is returning <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve
    and he will after his sour fashion tell you
    what hath proceeded worthy note today <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i will do so <SENTENCE-END>  but look you cassius
    the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow  
    and all the rest look like a chidden train
    calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero
    looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
    as we have seen him in the capitol
    being crossd in conference by some senators <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  casca will tell us what the matter is <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  antonio
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  caesar
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  let me have men about me that are fat
    sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
    yond cassius has a lean and hungry look
    he thinks too much such men are dangerous <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  fear him not caesar hes not dangerous
    he is a noble roman and well given <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  would he were fatter but i fear him not
    yet if my name were liable to fear
    i do not know the man i should avoid
    so soon as that spare cassius <SENTENCE-END>  he reads much
    he is a great observer and he looks
    quite through the deeds of men <SENTENCE-END>  he loves no plays  
    as thou dost antony he hears no music
    seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
    as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit
    that could be moved to smile at anything <SENTENCE-END> 
    such men as he be never at hearts ease
    whiles they behold a greater than themselves
    and therefore are they very dangerous <SENTENCE-END> 
    i rather tell thee what is to be feard
    than what i fear for always i am caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
    and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him <SENTENCE-END> 
              sennet <SENTENCE-END>  exeunt caesar and all his train but casca <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  ay casca tell us what hath chanced today
    that caesar looks so sad <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  why you were with him were you not
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i should not then ask casca what had chanced <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  why there was a crown offered him and being offered him
     he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
     people fell ashouting <SENTENCE-END>   
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what was the second noise for
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  why for that too <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  they shouted thrice <SENTENCE-END>  what was the last cry for
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  why for that too <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  was the crown offered him thrice
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler
    than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
    shouted <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  who offered him the crown
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  why antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  tell us the manner of it gentle casca <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  i can as well be hangd as tell the manner of it <SENTENCE-END>  it was
    mere foolery i did not mark it <SENTENCE-END>  i saw mark antony offer him a
    crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these
    coronets and as i told you he put it by once <SENTENCE-END>  but for all
    that to my thinking he would fain have had it <SENTENCE-END>  then he offered
    it to him again then he put it by again <SENTENCE-END>  but to my thinking he
    was very loath to lay his fingers off it <SENTENCE-END>  and then he offered it
    the third time he put it the third time by and still as he
    refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands  
    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
    stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had
    almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it <SENTENCE-END>  and
    for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips
    and receiving the bad air <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  but soft i pray you what did caesars wound
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
    speechless <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  tis very like <SENTENCE-END>  he hath the falling sickness <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  no caesar hath it not but you and i
    and honest casca we have the falling sickness <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell
    down <SENTENCE-END>  if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
    according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do
    the players in the theatre i am no true man <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what said he when he came unto himself
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
    herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet
    and offered them his throat to cut <SENTENCE-END>  an had been a man of any
    occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i  
    might go to hell among the rogues <SENTENCE-END>  and so he fell <SENTENCE-END>  when he came
    to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss
    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity <SENTENCE-END>  three or
    four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave
    him with all their hearts <SENTENCE-END>  but theres no heed to be taken of
    them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done
    no less <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  and after that he came thus sad away
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  ay <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  did cicero say anything
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  ay he spoke greek <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  to what effect
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face
    again but those that understood him smiled at one another and
    shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me <SENTENCE-END>  i
    could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling
    scarfs off caesars images are put to silence <SENTENCE-END>  fare you well <SENTENCE-END> 
    there was more foolery yet if could remember it <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  will you sup with me tonight casca
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  no i am promised forth <SENTENCE-END>   
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  will you dine with me tomorrow
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth
    the eating <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  good i will expect you <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  do so farewell both <SENTENCE-END>                             exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
    he was quick mettle when he went to school <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  so is he now in execution
    of any bold or noble enterprise
    however he puts on this tardy form <SENTENCE-END> 
    this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
    which gives men stomach to digest his words
    with better appetite <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  and so it is <SENTENCE-END>  for this time i will leave you <SENTENCE-END> 
    tomorrow if you please to speak with me
    i will come home to you or if you will
    come home to me and i will wait for you <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i will do so <SENTENCE-END>  till then think of the world <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                    exit brutus <SENTENCE-END> 
    well brutus thou art noble yet i see  
    thy honorable mettle may be wrought
    from that it is disposed therefore it is meet
    that noble minds keep ever with their likes
    for who so firm that cannot be seduced
    caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i were brutus now and he were cassius
    he should not humor me <SENTENCE-END>  i will this night
    in several hands in at his windows throw
    as if they came from several citizens
    writings all tending to the great opinion
    that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
    caesars ambition shall be glanced at <SENTENCE-END> 
    and after this let caesar seat him sure
    for we will shake him or worse days endure <SENTENCE-END>            exit <SENTENCE-END> 




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
a street <SENTENCE-END>  thunder and lightning <SENTENCE-END> 

enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero <SENTENCE-END> 

  cicero <SENTENCE-END>  good even casca <SENTENCE-END>  brought you caesar home
    why are you breathless and why stare you so
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  are not you moved when all the sway of earth
    shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero
    i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
    have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen
    the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
    to be exalted with the threatening clouds
    but never till tonight never till now
    did i go through a tempest dropping fire <SENTENCE-END> 
    either there is a civil strife in heaven
    or else the world too saucy with the gods
    incenses them to send destruction <SENTENCE-END> 
  cicero <SENTENCE-END>  why saw you anything more wonderful
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  a common slave you know him well by sight
    held up his left hand which did flame and burn  
    like twenty torches joind and yet his hand
    not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd <SENTENCE-END> 
    besides i ha not since put up my sword
    against the capitol i met a lion
    who glazd upon me and went surly by
    without annoying me <SENTENCE-END>  and there were drawn
    upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
    transformed with their fear who swore they saw
    men all in fire walk up and down the streets <SENTENCE-END> 
    and yesterday the bird of night did sit
    even at noonday upon the marketplace
    howling and shrieking <SENTENCE-END>  when these prodigies
    do so conjointly meet let not men say
    these are their reasons they are natural
    for i believe they are portentous things
    unto the climate that they point upon <SENTENCE-END> 
  cicero <SENTENCE-END>  indeed it is a strangedisposed time <SENTENCE-END> 
    but men may construe things after their fashion
    clean from the purpose of the things themselves <SENTENCE-END> 
    comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow  
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  he doth for he did bid antonio
    send word to you he would be there tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  cicero <SENTENCE-END>  good then casca <SENTENCE-END>  this disturbed sky
    is not to walk in <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  farewell cicero <SENTENCE-END>                           exit cicero <SENTENCE-END> 

                        enter cassius <SENTENCE-END> 

  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  whos there
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  a roman <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  casca by your voice <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  your ear is good <SENTENCE-END>  cassius what night is this
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  a very pleasing night to honest men <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  who ever knew the heavens menace so
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  those that have known the earth so full of faults <SENTENCE-END> 
    for my part i have walkd about the streets
    submitting me unto the perilous night
    and thus unbraced casca as you see
    have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
    and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open  
    the breast of heaven i did present myself
    even in the aim and very flash of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
    it is the part of men to fear and tremble
    when the most mighty gods by tokens send
    such dreadful heralds to astonish us <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  you are dull casca and those sparks of life
    that should be in a roman you do want
    or else you use not <SENTENCE-END>  you look pale and gaze
    and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
    to see the strange impatience of the heavens <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if you would consider the true cause
    why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
    why birds and beasts from quality and kind
    why old men fools and children calculate
    why all these things change from their ordinance
    their natures and preformed faculties
    to monstrous quality why you shall find
    that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
    to make them instruments of fear and warning  
    unto some monstrous state <SENTENCE-END> 
    now could i casca name to thee a man
    most like this dreadful night
    that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
    as doth the lion in the capitol
    a man no mightier than thyself or me
    in personal action yet prodigious grown
    and fearful as these strange eruptions are <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  let it be who it is for romans now
    have thews and limbs like to their ancestors <SENTENCE-END> 
    but woe the while our fathers minds are dead
    and we are governd with our mothers spirits
    our yoke and sufferance show us womanish <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    mean to establish caesar as a king
    and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
    in every place save here in italy <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i know where i will wear this dagger then
    cassius from bondage will deliver cassius <SENTENCE-END>   
    therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
    therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat <SENTENCE-END> 
    nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
    nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
    can be retentive to the strength of spirit
    but life being weary of these worldly bars
    never lacks power to dismiss itself <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i know this know all the world besides
    that part of tyranny that i do bear
    i can shake off at pleasure <SENTENCE-END>                   thunder still <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  so can i <SENTENCE-END> 
    so every bondman in his own hand bears
    the power to cancel his captivity <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  and why should caesar be a tyrant then
    poor man i know he would not be a wolf
    but that he sees the romans are but sheep <SENTENCE-END> 
    he were no lion were not romans hinds <SENTENCE-END> 
    those that with haste will make a mighty fire
    begin it with weak straws <SENTENCE-END>  what trash is rome
    what rubbish and what offal when it serves  
    for the base matter to illuminate
    so vile a thing as caesar but o grief
    where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this
    before a willing bondman then i know
    my answer must be made <SENTENCE-END>  but i am armd
    and dangers are to me indifferent <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  you speak to casca and to such a man
    that is no fleering telltale <SENTENCE-END>  hold my hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    be factious for redress of all these griefs
    and i will set this foot of mine as far
    as who goes farthest <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  theres a bargain made <SENTENCE-END> 
    now know you casca i have moved already
    some certain of the noblestminded romans
    to undergo with me an enterprise
    of honorabledangerous consequence
    and i do know by this they stay for me
    in pompeys porch <SENTENCE-END>  for now this fearful night
    there is no stir or walking in the streets
    and the complexion of the element  
    in favors like the work we have in hand
    most bloody fiery and most terrible <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter cinna <SENTENCE-END> 

  casca <SENTENCE-END>  stand close awhile for here comes one in haste <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  tis cinna i do know him by his gait
    he is a friend <SENTENCE-END>  cinna where haste you so
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  to find out you <SENTENCE-END>  whos that metellus cimber
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  no it is casca one incorporate
    to our attempts <SENTENCE-END>  am i not stayd for cinna
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  i am glad ont <SENTENCE-END>  what a fearful night is this
    theres two or three of us have seen strange sights <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  am i not stayd for tell me <SENTENCE-END> 
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  yes you are <SENTENCE-END>

act ii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 

enter brutus in his orchard <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what lucius ho
    i cannot by the progress of the stars
    give guess how near to day <SENTENCE-END>  lucius i say
    i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly <SENTENCE-END> 
    when lucius when awake i say what lucius

                            enter lucius <SENTENCE-END> 

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  calld you my lord
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  get me a taper in my study lucius <SENTENCE-END> 
    when it is lighted come and call me here <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  i will my lord <SENTENCE-END>                                  exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  it must be by his death and for my part
    i know no personal cause to spurn at him
    but for the general <SENTENCE-END>  he would be crownd
    how that might change his nature theres the question <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    and that craves wary walking <SENTENCE-END>  crown him that  
    and then i grant we put a sting in him
    that at his will he may do danger with <SENTENCE-END> 
    the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar
    i have not known when his affections swayd
    more than his reason <SENTENCE-END>  but tis a common proof
    that lowliness is young ambitions ladder
    whereto the climberupward turns his face
    but when he once attains the upmost round
    he then unto the ladder turns his back
    looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
    by which he did ascend <SENTENCE-END>  so caesar may
    then lest he may prevent <SENTENCE-END>  and since the quarrel
    will bear no color for the thing he is
    fashion it thus that what he is augmented
    would run to these and these extremities
    and therefore think him as a serpents egg
    which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous
    and kill him in the shell <SENTENCE-END> 
  
                        reenter lucius <SENTENCE-END> 

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  the taper burneth in your closet sir <SENTENCE-END> 
    searching the window for a flint i found
    this paper thus seald up and i am sure
    it did not lie there when i went to bed <SENTENCE-END> 
                                           gives him the letter <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  get you to bed again it is not day <SENTENCE-END> 
    is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  i know not sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  look in the calendar and bring me word <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  i will sir <SENTENCE-END>                                      exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  the exhalations whizzing in the air
    give so much light that i may read by them <SENTENCE-END> 
                                     opens the letter and reads <SENTENCE-END> 
    brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself
    shall rome etc <SENTENCE-END>  speak strike redress

    brutus thou sleepst awake
    such instigations have been often droppd  
    where i have took them up <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall rome etc <SENTENCE-END>  thus must i piece it out <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall rome stand under one mans awe what rome
    my ancestors did from the streets of rome
    the tarquin drive when he was calld a king <SENTENCE-END> 
    speak strike redress am i entreated
    to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise
    if the redress will follow thou receivest
    thy full petition at the hand of brutus

                        reenter lucius <SENTENCE-END> 

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  sir march is wasted fifteen days <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                knocking within <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  tis good <SENTENCE-END>  go to the gate somebody knocks <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                    exit lucius <SENTENCE-END> 
    since cassius first did whet me against caesar
    i have not slept <SENTENCE-END> 
    between the acting of a dreadful thing
    and the first motion all the interim is  
    like a phantasma or a hideous dream
    the genius and the mortal instruments
    are then in council and the state of man
    like to a little kingdom suffers then
    the nature of an insurrection <SENTENCE-END> 

                         reenter lucius <SENTENCE-END> 

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  sir tis your brother cassius at the door
    who doth desire to see you <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  is he alone
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  no sir there are more with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  do you know them
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  no sir their hats are pluckd about their ears
    and half their faces buried in their cloaks
    that by no means i may discover them
    by any mark of favor <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  let em enter <SENTENCE-END>                             exit lucius <SENTENCE-END> 
    they are the faction <SENTENCE-END>  o conspiracy
    shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night  
    when evils are most free o then by day
    where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
    hide it in smiles and affability
    for if thou path thy native semblance on
    not erebus itself were dim enough
    to hide thee from prevention <SENTENCE-END> 

    enter the conspirators cassius casca decius cinna
                metellus cimber and trebonius <SENTENCE-END> 

  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i think we are too bold upon your rest <SENTENCE-END> 
    good morrow brutus do we trouble you
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i have been up this hour awake all night <SENTENCE-END> 
    know i these men that come along with you
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  yes every man of them and no man here
    but honors you and every one doth wish
    you had but that opinion of yourself
    which every noble roman bears of you <SENTENCE-END> 
    this is trebonius <SENTENCE-END>   
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  he is welcome hither <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  this decius brutus <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  he is welcome too <SENTENCE-END> 
cassius <SENTENCE-END>  this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  they are all welcome <SENTENCE-END> 
    what watchful cares do interpose themselves
    betwixt your eyes and night
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  shall i entreat a word                 they whisper <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  here lies the east <SENTENCE-END>  doth not the day break here
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END> 
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  o pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines
    that fret the clouds are messengers of day <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  you shall confess that you are both deceived <SENTENCE-END> 
    here as i point my sword the sun arises
    which is a great way growing on the south
    weighing the youthful season of the year <SENTENCE-END> 
    some two months hence up higher toward the north
    he first presents his fire and the high east
    stands as the capitol directly here <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  give me your hands all over one by one <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  and let us swear our resolution <SENTENCE-END>   
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  no not an oath <SENTENCE-END>  if not the face of men
    the sufferance of our souls the times abuse
    if these be motives weak break off betimes
    and every man hence to his idle bed
    so let highsighted tyranny range on
    till each man drop by lottery <SENTENCE-END>  but if these
    as i am sure they do bear fire enough
    to kindle cowards and to steel with valor
    the melting spirits of women then countrymen
    what need we any spur but our own cause
    to prick us to redress what other bond
    than secret romans that have spoke the word
    and will not palter and what other oath
    than honesty to honesty engaged
    that this shall be or we will fall for it
    swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
    old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
    that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
    such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
    the even virtue of our enterprise  
    nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
    to think that or our cause or our performance
    did need an oath when every drop of blood
    that every roman bears and nobly bears
    is guilty of a several bastardy
    if he do break the smallest particle
    of any promise that hath passd from him <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  but what of cicero shall we sound him
    i think he will stand very strong with us <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  let us not leave him out <SENTENCE-END> 
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  no by no means <SENTENCE-END> 
  metellus <SENTENCE-END>  o let us have him for his silver hairs
    will purchase us a good opinion
    and buy mens voices to commend our deeds <SENTENCE-END> 
    it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands
    our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
    but all be buried in his gravity <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o name him not let us not break with him
    for he will never follow anything
    that other men begin <SENTENCE-END>   
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  then leave him out <SENTENCE-END> 
  casca <SENTENCE-END>  indeed he is not fit <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  shall no man else be touchd but only caesar
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  decius well urged <SENTENCE-END>  i think it is not meet
    mark antony so well beloved of caesar
    should outlive caesar <SENTENCE-END>  we shall find of him
    a shrewd contriver and you know his means
    if he improve them may well stretch so far
    as to annoy us all which to prevent
    let antony and caesar fall together <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
    to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
    like wrath in death and envy afterwards
    for antony is but a limb of caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius <SENTENCE-END> 
    we all stand up against the spirit of caesar
    and in the spirit of men there is no blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    o that we then could come by caesars spirit
    and not dismember caesar but alas
    caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends  
    lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully
    lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods
    not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
    and let our hearts as subtle masters do
    stir up their servants to an act of rage
    and after seem to chide em <SENTENCE-END>  this shall make
    our purpose necessary and not envious
    which so appearing to the common eyes
    we shall be calld purgers not murderers <SENTENCE-END> 
    and for mark antony think not of him
    for he can do no more than caesars arm
    when caesars head is off <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  yet i fear him
    for in the ingrated love he bears to caesar
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  alas good cassius do not think of him <SENTENCE-END> 
    if he love caesar all that he can do
    is to himself take thought and die for caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    and that were much he should for he is given
    to sports to wildness and much company <SENTENCE-END> 
  trebonius <SENTENCE-END>  there is no fear in himlet him not die  
    for he will live and laugh at this hereafter <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                  clock strikes <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  peace count the clock <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  the clock hath stricken three <SENTENCE-END> 
  trebonius <SENTENCE-END>  tis time to part <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  but it is doubtful yet
    whether caesar will come forth today or no
    for he is superstitious grown of late
    quite from the main opinion he held once
    of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies <SENTENCE-END> 
    it may be these apparent prodigies
    the unaccustomd terror of this night
    and the persuasion of his augurers
    may hold him from the capitol today <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  never fear that <SENTENCE-END>  if he be so resolved
    i can oersway him for he loves to hear
    that unicorns may be betrayd with trees
    and bears with glasses elephants with holes
    lions with toils and men with flatterers
    but when i tell him he hates flatterers  
    he says he does being then most flattered <SENTENCE-END> 
    let me work
    for i can give his humor the true bent
    and i will bring him to the capitol <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  nay we will all of us be there to fetch him <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  by the eighth hour <SENTENCE-END>  is that the utter most
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  be that the uttermost and fail not then <SENTENCE-END> 
  metellus <SENTENCE-END>  caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
    who rated him for speaking well of pompey <SENTENCE-END> 
    i wonder none of you have thought of him <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  now good metellus go along by him <SENTENCE-END> 
    he loves me well and i have given him reasons
    send him but hither and ill fashion him <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  the morning comes upon s <SENTENCE-END>  well leave you brutus
    and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
    what you have said and show yourselves true romans <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
    let not our looks put on our purposes
    but bear it as our roman actors do
    with untired spirits and formal constancy <SENTENCE-END>   
    and so good morrow to you every one <SENTENCE-END> 
                                          exeunt all but brutus <SENTENCE-END> 
    boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter <SENTENCE-END> 
    enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
    thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
    which busy care draws in the brains of men
    therefore thou sleepst so sound <SENTENCE-END> 

                           enter portia <SENTENCE-END> 

  portia <SENTENCE-END>  brutus my lord
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
    it is not for your health thus to commit
    your weak condition to the raw cold morning <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  nor for yours neither <SENTENCE-END>  have ungently brutus
    stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
    you suddenly arose and walkd about
    musing and sighing with your arms across
    and when i askd you what the matter was
    you stared upon me with ungentle looks <SENTENCE-END>   
    i urged you further then you scratchd your head
    and too impatiently stampd with your foot <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet i insisted yet you answerd not
    but with an angry waiter of your hand
    gave sign for me to leave you <SENTENCE-END>  so i did
    fearing to strengthen that impatience
    which seemd too much enkindled and withal
    hoping it was but an effect of humor
    which sometime hath his hour with every man <SENTENCE-END> 
    it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
    and could it work so much upon your shape
    as it hath much prevaild on your condition
    i should not know you brutus <SENTENCE-END>  dear my lord
    make me acquainted with your cause of grief <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i am not well in health and that is all <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  brutus is wise and were he not in health
    he would embrace the means to come by it <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  why so i do <SENTENCE-END>  good portia go to bed <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  is brutus sick and is it physical
    to walk unbraced and suck up the humors  
    of the dank morning what is brutus sick
    and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
    to dare the vile contagion of the night
    and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
    to add unto his sickness no my brutus
    you have some sick offense within your mind
    which by the right and virtue of my place
    i ought to know of and upon my knees
    i charm you by my once commended beauty
    by all your vows of love and that great vow
    which did incorporate and make us one
    that you unfold to me yourself your half
    why you are heavy and what men tonight
    have had resort to you for here have been
    some six or seven who did hide their faces
    even from darkness <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  kneel not gentle portia <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i should not need if you were gentle brutus <SENTENCE-END> 
    within the bond of marriage tell me brutus
    is it excepted i should know no secrets  
    that appertain to you am i yourself
    but as it were in sort or limitation
    to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
    and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs
    of your good pleasure if it be no more
    portia is brutus harlot not his wife <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  you are my true and honorable wife
    as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
    that visit my sad heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  if this were true then should i know this secret <SENTENCE-END> 
    i grant i am a woman but withal
    a woman that lord brutus took to wife <SENTENCE-END> 
    i grant i am a woman but withal
    a woman well reputed catos daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
    think you i am no stronger than my sex
    being so fatherd and so husbanded
    tell me your counsels i will not disclose em <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have made strong proof of my constancy
    giving myself a voluntary wound
    here in the thigh <SENTENCE-END>  can i bear that with patience  
    and not my husbands secrets
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o ye gods
    render me worthy of this noble wife knocking within <SENTENCE-END> 
    hark hark one knocks <SENTENCE-END>  portia go in awhile
    and by and by thy bosom shall partake
    the secrets of my heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    all my engagements i will construe to thee
    all the charactery of my sad brows <SENTENCE-END> 
    leave me with haste <SENTENCE-END>  exit portia <SENTENCE-END>  lucius whos that knocks

                  reenter lucius with ligarius <SENTENCE-END> 

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  here is a sick man that would speak with you <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  caius ligarius that metellus spake of <SENTENCE-END> 
    boy stand aside <SENTENCE-END>  caius ligarius how
  ligarius <SENTENCE-END>  vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o what a time have you chose out brave caius
    to wear a kerchief would you were not sick
  ligarius <SENTENCE-END>  i am not sick if brutus have in hand
    any exploit worthy the name of honor <SENTENCE-END>   
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  such an exploit have i in hand ligarius
    had you a healthful ear to hear of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  ligarius <SENTENCE-END>  by all the gods that romans bow before
    i here discard my sickness soul of rome
    brave son derived from honorable loins
    thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
    my mortified spirit <SENTENCE-END>  now bid me run
    and i will strive with things impossible
    yea get the better of them <SENTENCE-END>  whats to do
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  a piece of work that will make sick men whole <SENTENCE-END> 
  ligarius <SENTENCE-END>  but are not some whole that we must make sick
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  that must we also <SENTENCE-END>  what it is my caius
    i shall unfold to thee as we are going
    to whom it must be done <SENTENCE-END> 
  ligarius <SENTENCE-END>  set on your foot
    and with a heart newfired i follow you
    to do i know not what but it sufficeth
    that brutus leads me on <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  follow me then <SENTENCE-END>                                 exeunt <SENTENCE-END> 




scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
caesars house <SENTENCE-END>  thunder and lightning <SENTENCE-END> 

enter caesar in his nightgown <SENTENCE-END> 

  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
    thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out
    help ho they murther caesar whos within

                         enter a servant <SENTENCE-END> 

  servant <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  go bid the priests do present sacrifice
    and bring me their opinions of success <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  i will my lord <SENTENCE-END>                                 exit <SENTENCE-END> 

                         enter calpurnia <SENTENCE-END> 

  calpurnia <SENTENCE-END>  what mean you caesar think you to walk forth
    you shall not stir out of your house today <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  caesar shall forth the things that threatend me
    neer lookd but on my back when they shall see  
    the face of caesar they are vanished <SENTENCE-END> 
  calpurnia <SENTENCE-END>  caesar i i stood on ceremonies
    yet now they fright me <SENTENCE-END>  there is one within
    besides the things that we have heard and seen
    recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch <SENTENCE-END> 
    a lioness hath whelped in the streets
    and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead
    fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
    in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
    which drizzled blood upon the capitol
    the noise of battle hurtled in the air
    horses did neigh and dying men did groan
    and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets <SENTENCE-END> 
    o caesar these things are beyond all use
    and i do fear them <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  what can be avoided
    whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
    yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions
    are to the world in general as to caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
  calpurnia <SENTENCE-END>  when beggars die there are no comets seen  
    the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  cowards die many times before their deaths
    the valiant never taste of death but once <SENTENCE-END> 
    of all the wonders that i yet have heard
    it seems to me most strange that men should fear
    seeing that death a necessary end
    will come when it will come <SENTENCE-END> 

                      reenter servant <SENTENCE-END> 

    what say the augurers
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  they would not have you to stir forth today <SENTENCE-END> 
    plucking the entrails of an offering forth
    they could not find a heart within the beast <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  the gods do this in shame of cowardice <SENTENCE-END> 
    caesar should be a beast without a heart
    if he should stay at home today for fear <SENTENCE-END> 
    no caesar shall not <SENTENCE-END>  danger knows full well
    that caesar is more dangerous than he <SENTENCE-END> 
    we are two lions litterd in one day  
    and i the elder and more terrible <SENTENCE-END> 
    and caesar shall go forth <SENTENCE-END> 
  calpurnia <SENTENCE-END>  alas my lord
    your wisdom is consumed in confidence <SENTENCE-END> 
    do not go forth today <SENTENCE-END>  call it my fear
    that keeps you in the house and not your own <SENTENCE-END> 
    well send mark antony to the senate house
    and he shall say you are not well today <SENTENCE-END> 
    let me upon my knee prevail in this <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  mark antony shall say i am not well
    and for thy humor i will stay at home <SENTENCE-END> 

                        enter decius <SENTENCE-END> 

    heres decius brutus he shall tell them so <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar
    i come to fetch you to the senate house <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  and you are come in very happy time
    to bear my greeting to the senators
    and tell them that i will not come today <SENTENCE-END>   
    cannot is false and that i dare not falser
    i will not come today <SENTENCE-END>  tell them so decius <SENTENCE-END> 
  calpurnia <SENTENCE-END>  say he is sick <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  shall caesar send a lie
    have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far
    to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
    decius go tell them caesar will not come <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  most mighty caesar let me know some cause
    lest i be laughd at when i tell them so <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  the cause is in my will i will not come
    that is enough to satisfy the senate <SENTENCE-END> 
    but for your private satisfaction
    because i love you i will let you know <SENTENCE-END> 
    calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
    she dreamt tonight she saw my statue
    which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
    did run pure blood and many lusty romans
    came smiling and did bathe their hands in it <SENTENCE-END> 
    and these does she apply for warnings and portents
    and evils imminent and on her knee  
    hath beggd that i will stay at home today <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  this dream is all amiss interpreted
    it was a vision fair and fortunate <SENTENCE-END> 
    your statue spouting blood in many pipes
    in which so many smiling romans bathed
    signifies that from you great rome shall suck
    reviving blood and that great men shall press
    for tinctures stains relics and cognizance <SENTENCE-END> 
    this by calpurnias dream is signified <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  and this way have you well expounded it <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  i have when you have heard what i can say <SENTENCE-END> 
    and know it now the senate have concluded
    to give this day a crown to mighty caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you shall send them word you will not come
    their minds may change <SENTENCE-END>  besides it were a mock
    apt to be renderd for someone to say
    break up the senate till another time
    when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams <SENTENCE-END> 
    if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
    lo caesar is afraid  
    pardon me caesar for my dear dear love
    to your proceeding bids me tell you this
    and reason to my love is liable <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
    i am ashamed i did yield to them <SENTENCE-END> 
    give me my robe for i will go <SENTENCE-END>

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what said popilius lena
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  he wishd today our enterprise might thrive <SENTENCE-END>

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  he is addressd press near and second him <SENTENCE-END> 
  cinna <SENTENCE-END>  casca you are the first that rears your hand <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  are we all ready what is now amiss
    that caesar and his senate must redress
  metellus <SENTENCE-END>  most high most mighty and most puissant caesar
    metellus cimber throws before thy seat
    an humble heart <SENTENCE-END>                                      kneels <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  i must prevent thee cimber <SENTENCE-END> 
    these couchings and these lowly courtesies
    might fire the blood of ordinary men
    and turn preordinance and first decree
    into the law of children <SENTENCE-END>  be not fond
    to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
    that will be thawd from the true quality
    with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words
    lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning <SENTENCE-END> 
    thy brother by decree is banished <SENTENCE-END>   
    if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
    i spurn thee like a cur out of my way <SENTENCE-END> 
    know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
    will he be satisfied <SENTENCE-END> 
  metellus <SENTENCE-END>  is there no voice more worthy than my own
    to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear
    for the repealing of my banishd brother
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar
    desiring thee that publius cimber may
    have an immediate freedom of repeal <SENTENCE-END>

  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  pardon caesar caesar pardon
    as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall
    to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber <SENTENCE-END> 
  caesar <SENTENCE-END>  i could be well moved if i were as you
    if i could pray to move prayers would move me
    but i am constant as the northern star
    of whose truefixd and resting quality
    there is no fellow in the firmament <SENTENCE-END> 
    the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks  
    they are all fire and every one doth shine
    but theres but one in all doth hold his place <SENTENCE-END> 
    so in the world tis furnishd well with men
    and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
    yet in the number i do know but one
    that unassailable holds on his rank
    unshaked of motion and that i am he
    let me a little show it even in this
    that i was constant cimber should be banishd
    and constant do remain to keep him so <SENTENCE-END>

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  fates we will know your pleasures <SENTENCE-END> 
    that we shall die we know tis but the time
    and drawing days out that men stand upon <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  why he that cuts off twenty years of life
    cuts off so many years of fearing death <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  grant that and then is death a benefit
    so are we caesars friends that have abridged
    his time of fearing death <SENTENCE-END>  stoop romans stoop
    and let us bathe our hands in caesars blood
    up to the elbows and besmear our swords
    then walk we forth even to the marketplace
    and waving our red weapons oer our heads
    lets all cry peace freedom and liberty
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  stoop then and wash <SENTENCE-END>  how many ages hence
    shall this our lofty scene be acted over
    in states unborn and accents yet unknown  
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  how many times shall caesar bleed in sport
    that now on pompeys basis lies along
    no worthier than the dust
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  so oft as that shall be
    so often shall the knot of us be calld
    the men that gave their country liberty <SENTENCE-END> 
  decius <SENTENCE-END>  what shall we forth
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  ay every man away <SENTENCE-END> 
    brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels

                        enter a servant <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  soft who comes here a friend of antonys <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  thus brutus did my master bid me kneel
    thus did mark antony bid me fall down
    and being prostrate thus he bade me say
    brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
    caesar was mighty bold royal and loving <SENTENCE-END> 
    say i love brutus and i honor him  
    say i feard caesar honord him and loved him <SENTENCE-END> 
    if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
    may safely come to him and be resolved
    how caesar hath deserved to lie in death
    mark antony shall not love caesar dead
    so well as brutus living but will follow
    the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
    thorough the hazards of this untrod state
    with all true faith <SENTENCE-END>  so says my master antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  thy master is a wise and valiant roman
    i never thought him worse <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell him so please him come unto this place
    he shall be satisfied and by my honor
    depart untouchd <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  ill fetch him presently <SENTENCE-END>                        exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i know that we shall have him well to friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i wish we may but yet have i a mind
    that fears him much and my misgiving still
    falls shrewdly to the purpose <SENTENCE-END> 
  
                          reenter antony <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  but here comes antony <SENTENCE-END>  welcome mark antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
    are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
    shrunk to this little measure fare thee well <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know not gentlemen what you intend
    who else must be let blood who else is rank <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i myself there is no hour so fit
    as caesars deaths hour nor no instrument
    of half that worth as those your swords made rich
    with the most noble blood of all this world <SENTENCE-END> 
    i do beseech ye if you bear me hard
    now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
    fulfill your pleasure <SENTENCE-END>  live a thousand years
    i shall not find myself so apt to die
    no place will please me so no means of death
    as here by caesar and by you cut off
    the choice and master spirits of this age <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o antony beg not your death of us  
    though now we must appear bloody and cruel
    as by our hands and this our present act
    you see we do yet see you but our hands
    and this the bleeding business they have done <SENTENCE-END> 
    our hearts you see not they are pitiful
    and pity to the general wrong of rome
    as fire drives out fire so pity pity
    hath done this deed on caesar <SENTENCE-END>  for your part
    to you our swords have leaden points mark antony
    our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
    of brothers temper do receive you in
    with all kind love good thoughts and reverence <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  your voice shall be as strong as any mans
    in the disposing of new dignities <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  only be patient till we have appeased
    the multitude beside themselves with fear
    and then we will deliver you the cause
    why i that did love caesar when i struck him
    have thus proceeded <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  i doubt not of your wisdom <SENTENCE-END>   
    let each man render me his bloody hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    first marcus brutus will i shake with you

    now decius brutus yours now yours metellus
    yours cinna and my valiant casca yours
    though last not least in love yours good trebonius <SENTENCE-END> 
    gentlemen all alas what shall i say
    my credit now stands on such slippery ground
    that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
    either a coward or a flatterer <SENTENCE-END> 
    that i did love thee caesar o tis true
    if then thy spirit look upon us now
    shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
    to see thy antony making his peace
    shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
    most noble in the presence of thy corse
    had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds
    weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
    it would become me better than to close
    in terms of friendship with thine enemies <SENTENCE-END>   
    pardon me julius here wast thou bayd brave hart
    here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
    signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe <SENTENCE-END> 
    o world thou wast the forest to this hart
    and this indeed o world the heart of thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    how like a deer strucken by many princes
    dost thou here lie
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  mark antony
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me caius cassius <SENTENCE-END> 
    the enemies of caesar shall say this
    then in a friend it is cold modesty <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i blame you not for praising caesar so
    but what compact mean you to have with us
    will you be prickd in number of our friends
    or shall we on and not depend on you
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i took your hands but was indeed
    swayd from the point by looking down on caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    friends am i with you all and love you all
    upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
    why and wherein caesar was dangerous <SENTENCE-END>   
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  or else were this a savage spectacle <SENTENCE-END> 
    our reasons are so full of good regard
    that were you antony the son of caesar
    you should be satisfied <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  thats all i seek
    and am moreover suitor that i may
    produce his body to the marketplace
    and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
    speak in the order of his funeral <SENTENCE-END>

    by that which he will utter
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  by your pardon
    i will myself into the pulpit first
    and show the reason of our caesars death <SENTENCE-END> 
    what antony shall speak i will protest
    he speaks by leave and by permission  
    and that we are contented caesar shall
    have all true rites and lawful ceremonies <SENTENCE-END> 
    it shall advantage more than do us wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i know not what may fall i like it not <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  mark antony here take you caesars body <SENTENCE-END> 
    you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
    but speak all good you can devise of caesar
    and say you dot by our permission
    else shall you not have any hand at all
    about his funeral <SENTENCE-END>  and you shall speak
    in the same pulpit whereto i am going
    after my speech is ended <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  be it so
    i do desire no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  prepare the body then and follow us <SENTENCE-END> 
                                          exeunt all but antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
    that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
    thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    that ever lived in the tide of times <SENTENCE-END>   
    woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
    over thy wounds now do i prophesy
    which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
    a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
    domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    shall cumber all the parts of italy
    blood and destruction shall be so in use
    and dreadful objects so familiar
    that mothers shall but smile when they behold
    their infants quarterd with the hands of war
    all pity choked with custom of fell deeds
    and caesars spirit ranging for revenge
    with ate by his side come hot from hell
    shall in these confines with a monarchs voice
    cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
    that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    with carrion men groaning for burial <SENTENCE-END> 

                        enter a servant <SENTENCE-END>

    that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved me i
    weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was
    valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him <SENTENCE-END>  there

  fourth citizen <SENTENCE-END>  twere best he speak no harm of brutus here <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  this caesar was a tyrant <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  nay thats certain <SENTENCE-END> 
    we are blest that rome is rid of him <SENTENCE-END>   
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  peace let us hear what antony can say <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  you gentle romans
  all <SENTENCE-END>  peace ho let us hear him <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
    i come to bury caesar not to praise him <SENTENCE-END> 
    the evil that men do lives after them
    the good is oft interred with their bones
    so let it be with caesar <SENTENCE-END>  the noble brutus
    hath told you caesar was ambitious
    if it were so it was a grievous fault
    and grievously hath caesar answerd it <SENTENCE-END> 
    here under leave of brutus and the rest
    for brutus is an honorable man
    so are they all all honorable men
    come i to speak in caesars funeral <SENTENCE-END> 
    he was my friend faithful and just to me
    but brutus says he was ambitious
    and brutus is an honorable man <SENTENCE-END> 
    he hath brought many captives home to rome
    whose ransoms did the general coffers fill <SENTENCE-END>   
    did this in caesar seem ambitious
    when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept
    ambition should be made of sterner stuff
    yet brutus says he was ambitious
    and brutus is an honorable man <SENTENCE-END> 
    you all did see that on the lupercal
    i thrice presented him a kingly crown
    which he did thrice refuse <SENTENCE-END>  was this ambition
    yet brutus says he was ambitious
    and sure he is an honorable man <SENTENCE-END> 
    i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke
    but here i am to speak what i do know <SENTENCE-END> 
    you all did love him once not without cause
    what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
    o judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts
    and men have lost their reason <SENTENCE-END>  bear with me
    my heart is in the coffin there with caesar
    and i must pause till it come back to me <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  methinks there is much reason in his sayings <SENTENCE-END> 
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  if thou consider rightly of the matter  
    caesar has had great wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  has he masters
    i fear there will a worse come in his place <SENTENCE-END> 
  fourth citizen <SENTENCE-END>  markd ye his words he would not take the crown
    therefore tis certain he was not ambitious <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  if it be found so some will dear abide it <SENTENCE-END> 
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  theres not a nobler man in rome than antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  fourth citizen <SENTENCE-END>  now mark him he begins again to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  but yesterday the word of caesar might
    have stood against the world <SENTENCE-END>  now lies he there
    and none so poor to do him reverence <SENTENCE-END> 
    o masters if i were disposed to stir
    your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
    i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong
    who you all know are honorable men <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will not do them wrong i rather choose
    to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
    than i will wrong such honorable men <SENTENCE-END> 
    but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar  
    i found it in his closet tis his will <SENTENCE-END> 
    let but the commons hear this testament
    which pardon me i do not mean to read
    and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds
    and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
    yea beg a hair of him for memory
    and dying mention it within their wills
    bequeathing it as a rich legacy
    unto their issue <SENTENCE-END> 
  fourth citizen <SENTENCE-END>  well hear the will <SENTENCE-END>  read it mark antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  all <SENTENCE-END>  the will the will we will hear caesars will <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  have patience gentle friends i must not read it

    and being men hearing the will of caesar

    then make a ring about the corse of caesar
    and let me show you him that made the will <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall i descend and will you give me leave
  all <SENTENCE-END>  come down <SENTENCE-END> 
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  descend <SENTENCE-END> 
                                  he comes down from the pulpit <SENTENCE-END>

    you all do know this mantle <SENTENCE-END>  i remember
    the first time ever caesar put it on
    twas on a summers evening in his tent
    that day he overcame the nervii <SENTENCE-END> 
    look in this place ran cassius dagger through
    see what a rent the envious casca made
    through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd
    and as he pluckd his cursed steel away
    mark how the blood of caesar followd it
    as rushing out of doors to be resolved
    if brutus so unkindly knockd or no
    for brutus as you know was caesars angel <SENTENCE-END> 
    judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
    this was the most unkindest cut of all
    for when the noble caesar saw him stab
    ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
    quite vanquishd him <SENTENCE-END>  then burst his mighty heart
    and in his mantle muffling up his face  
    even at the base of pompeys statue
    which all the while ran blood great caesar fell <SENTENCE-END> 
    o what a fall was there my countrymen
    then i and you and all of us fell down
    whilst bloody treason flourishd over us <SENTENCE-END> 
    o now you weep and i perceive you feel
    the dint of pity <SENTENCE-END>  these are gracious drops <SENTENCE-END>

act iv <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
a house in rome <SENTENCE-END>  antony octavius and lepidus seated at a table <SENTENCE-END> 

  antony <SENTENCE-END>  these many then shall die their names are prickd <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  your brother too must die consent you lepidus
  lepidus <SENTENCE-END>  i do consent
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  prick him down antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  lepidus <SENTENCE-END>  upon condition publius shall not live
    who is your sisters son mark antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  he shall not live look with a spot i damn him <SENTENCE-END> 
    but lepidus go you to caesars house
    fetch the will hither and we shall determine
    how to cut off some charge in legacies <SENTENCE-END> 
  lepidus <SENTENCE-END>  what shall i find you here
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  or here or at the capitol <SENTENCE-END>             exit lepidus <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  this is a slight unmeritable man
    meet to be sent on errands <SENTENCE-END>  is it fit
    the threefold world divided he should stand
    one of the three to share it
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  so you thought him
    and took his voice who should be prickd to die  
    in our black sentence and proscription <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  octavius i have seen more days than you
    and though we lay these honors on this man
    to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
    he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
    to groan and sweat under the business
    either led or driven as we point the way
    and having brought our treasure where we will
    then take we down his load and turn him off
    like to the empty ass to shake his ears
    and graze in commons <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  you may do your will
    but hes a tried and valiant soldier <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  so is my horse octavius and for that
    i do appoint him store of provender <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is a creature that i teach to fight
    to wind to stop to run directly on
    his corporal motion governd by my spirit <SENTENCE-END> 
    and in some taste is lepidus but so
    he must be taught and traind and bid go forth  
    a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
    on objects arts and imitations
    which out of use and staled by other men
    begin his fashion <SENTENCE-END>  do not talk of him
    but as a property <SENTENCE-END>  and now octavius
    listen great things <SENTENCE-END>  brutus and cassius
    are levying powers we must straight make head
    therefore let our alliance be combined
    our best friends made our means stretchd
    and let us presently go sit in council
    how covert matters may be best disclosed
    and open perils surest answered <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  let us do so for we are at the stake
    and bayd about with many enemies
    and some that smile have in their hearts i fear
    millions of mischiefs <SENTENCE-END>                                exeunt <SENTENCE-END> 




scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
camp near sardis <SENTENCE-END>  before brutus tent <SENTENCE-END>  drum <SENTENCE-END> 

enter brutus lucilius lucius and soldiers titinius and pindarus meet them <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  stand ho
  lucilius <SENTENCE-END>  give the word ho and stand <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  what now lucilius is cassius near
  lucilius <SENTENCE-END>  he is at hand and pindarus is come
    to do you salutation from his master <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  he greets me well <SENTENCE-END>  your master pindarus
    in his own change or by ill officers
    hath given me some worthy cause to wish
    things done undone but if he be at hand
    i shall be satisfied <SENTENCE-END> 
  pindarus <SENTENCE-END>  i do not doubt
    but that my noble master will appear
    such as he is full of regard and honor <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  he is not doubted <SENTENCE-END>  a word lucilius
    how he received you <SENTENCE-END>  let me be resolved <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucilius <SENTENCE-END>  with courtesy and with respect enough  
    but not with such familiar instances
    nor with such free and friendly conference
    as he hath used of old <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  thou hast described
    a hot friend cooling <SENTENCE-END>  ever note lucilius
    when love begins to sicken and decay
    it useth an enforced ceremony <SENTENCE-END> 
    there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
    but hollow men like horses hot at hand
    make gallant show and promise of their mettle
    but when they should endure the bloody spur
    they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
    sink in the trial <SENTENCE-END>  comes his army on
  lucilius <SENTENCE-END>  they meant his night in sard is to be quarterd
    the greater part the horse in general
    are come with cassius <SENTENCE-END>                      low march within <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  hark he is arrived <SENTENCE-END> 
    march gently on to meet him <SENTENCE-END>

  first soldier <SENTENCE-END>  stand
  second soldier <SENTENCE-END>  stand
  third soldier <SENTENCE-END>  stand
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  most noble brother you have done me wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
    and if not so how should i wrong a brother
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
    and when you do them
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  cassius be content
    speak your griefs softly i do know you well <SENTENCE-END> 
    before the eyes of both our armies here
    which should perceive nothing but love from us
    let us not wrangle <SENTENCE-END>  bid them move away
    then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs
    and i will give you audience <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  pindarus
    bid our commanders lead their charges off  
    a little from this ground <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  lucilius do you the like and let no man
    come to our tent till we have done our conference <SENTENCE-END> 
    let lucius and titinius guard our door <SENTENCE-END>              exeunt <SENTENCE-END> 




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
brutus tent <SENTENCE-END> 

enter brutus and cassius <SENTENCE-END> 

  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  that you have wrongd me doth appear in this
    you have condemnd and noted lucius pella
    for taking bribes here of the sardians
    wherein my letters praying on his side
    because i knew the man were slighted off <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  you wrongd yourself to write in such a case <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  in such a time as this it is not meet
    that every nice offense should bear his comment <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  let me tell you cassius you yourself
    are much condemnd to have an itching palm
    to sell and mart your offices for gold
    to undeservers <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i an itching palm
    you know that you are brutus that speaks this
    or by the gods this speech were else your last <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  the name of cassius honors this corruption
    and chastisement doth therefore hide his head <SENTENCE-END>   
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  chastisement
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  remember march the ides of march remember <SENTENCE-END> 
    did not great julius bleed for justice sake
    what villain touchd his body that did stab
    and not for justice what shall one of us
    that struck the foremost man of all this world
    but for supporting robbers shall we now
    contaminate our fingers with base bribes
    and sell the mighty space of our large honors
    for so much trash as may be grasped thus
    i had rather be a dog and bay the moon
    than such a roman <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  brutus bait not me
    ill not endure it <SENTENCE-END>  you forget yourself
    to hedge me in <SENTENCE-END>  i am a soldier i
    older in practice abler than yourself
    to make conditions <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  go to you are not cassius <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i am <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i say you are not <SENTENCE-END>   
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  urge me no more i shall forget myself
    have mind upon your health tempt me no farther <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  away slight man
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  ist possible
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  hear me for i will speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    must i give way and room to your rash choler
    shall i be frighted when a madman stares
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  o gods ye gods must i endure all this
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  all this ay more <SENTENCE-END>  fret till your proud heart break <SENTENCE-END> 
    go show your slaves how choleric you are
    and make your bondmen tremble <SENTENCE-END>  must i bouge
    must i observe you must i stand and crouch
    under your testy humor by the gods
    you shall digest the venom of your spleen
    though it do split you for from this day forth
    ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
    when you are waspish <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  is it come to this
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  you say you are a better soldier
    let it appear so make your vaunting true  
    and it shall please me well <SENTENCE-END>  for mine own part
    i shall be glad to learn of noble men <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus <SENTENCE-END> 
    i said an elder soldier not a better <SENTENCE-END> 
    did i say better
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  if you did i care not <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  peace peace you durst not so have tempted him <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i durst not
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  what durst not tempt him
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  for your life you durst not <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  do not presume too much upon my love
    i may do that i shall be sorry for <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  you have done that you should be sorry for <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is no terror cassius in your threats
    for i am armd so strong in honesty
    that they pass by me as the idle wind
    which i respect not <SENTENCE-END>  i did send to you
    for certain sums of gold which you denied me  
    for i can raise no money by vile means <SENTENCE-END> 
    by heaven i had rather coin my heart
    and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
    from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
    by any indirection <SENTENCE-END>  i did send
    to you for gold to pay my legions
    which you denied me <SENTENCE-END>  was that done like cassius
    should i have answerd caius cassius so
    when marcus brutus grows so covetous
    to lock such rascal counters from his friends
    be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
    dash him to pieces
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i denied you not <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  you did <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i did not <SENTENCE-END>  he was but a fool
    that brought my answer back <SENTENCE-END>  brutus hath rived my heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    a friend should bear his friends infirmities
    but brutus makes mine greater than they are <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i do not till you practise them on me <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  you love me not <SENTENCE-END>   
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  i do not like your faults <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  a friendly eye could never see such faults <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  a flatterers would not though they do appear
    as huge as high olympus <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  come antony and young octavius come
    revenge yourselves alone on cassius
    for cassius is aweary of the world
    hated by one he loves braved by his brother
    checkd like a bondman all his faults observed
    set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote
    to cast into my teeth <SENTENCE-END>  o i could weep
    my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger
    and here my naked breast within a heart
    dearer than plutos mine richer than gold <SENTENCE-END> 
    if that thou best a roman take it forth
    i that denied thee gold will give my heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    strike as thou didst at caesar for i know
    when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
    than ever thou lovedst cassius <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  sheathe your dagger <SENTENCE-END>   
    be angry when you will it shall have scope
    do what you will dishonor shall be humor <SENTENCE-END> 
    o cassius you are yoked with a lamb
    that carries anger as the flint bears fire
    who much enforced shows a hasty spark
    and straight is cold again <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  hath cassius lived
    to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus
    when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  when i spoke that i was illtemperd too <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  do you confess so much give me your hand <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  and my heart too <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  o brutus

    when that rash humor which my mother gave me
    makes me forgetful

  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  of your philosophy you make no use
    if you give place to accidental evils <SENTENCE-END>

    and call in question our necessities <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  portia art thou gone
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  no more i pray you <SENTENCE-END> 
    messala i have here received letters  
    that young octavius and mark antony
    come down upon us with a mighty power
    bending their expedition toward philippi <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  myself have letters of the selfsame tenure <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  with what addition
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  that by proscription and bills of outlawry
    octavius antony and lepidus
    have put to death an hundred senators <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  there in our letters do not well agree
    mine speak of seventy senators that died
    by their proscriptions cicero being one <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  cicero one
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  cicero is dead
    and by that order of proscription <SENTENCE-END> 
    had you your letters from your wife my lord
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  no messala <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  nor nothing in your letters writ of her
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  nothing messala <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  that methinks is strange <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  why ask you hear you aught of her in yours  
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  no my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  now as you are a roman tell me true <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  then like a roman bear the truth i tell
    for certain she is dead and by strange manner <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  why farewell portia <SENTENCE-END>  we must die messala <SENTENCE-END> 
    with meditating that she must die once
    i have the patience to endure it now <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  even so great men great losses should endure <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i have as much of this in art as you
    but yet my nature could not bear it so <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  well to our work alive <SENTENCE-END>  what do you think
    of marching to philippi presently
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i do not think it good <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  your reason
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  this it is
    tis better that the enemy seek us
    so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
    doing himself offense whilst we lying still
    are full of rest defense and nimbleness <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  good reasons must of force give place to better <SENTENCE-END>   
    the people twixt philippi and this ground
    do stand but in a forced affection
    for they have grudged us contribution <SENTENCE-END> 
    the enemy marching along by them
    by them shall make a fuller number up
    come on refreshd newadded and encouraged
    from which advantage shall we cut him off
    if at philippi we do face him there
    these people at our back <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  hear me good brother <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  under your pardon <SENTENCE-END>  you must note beside
    that we have tried the utmost of our friends
    our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
    the enemy increaseth every day
    we at the height are ready to decline <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is a tide in the affairs of men
    which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
    omitted all the voyage of their life
    is bound in shallows and in miseries <SENTENCE-END> 
    on such a full sea are we now afloat  
    and we must take the current when it serves
    or lose our ventures <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  then with your will go on
    well along ourselves and meet them at philippi <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  the deep of night is crept upon our talk
    and nature must obey necessity
    which we will niggard with a little rest <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is no more to say
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  no more <SENTENCE-END>  good night <SENTENCE-END> 
    early tomorrow will we rise and hence <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  lucius

                       reenter lucius <SENTENCE-END> 

    my gown <SENTENCE-END>                                         exit lucius <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell good messala

    good night and good repose <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  o my dear brother
    this was an ill beginning of the night <SENTENCE-END>   
    never come such division tween our souls

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
the plains of philippi <SENTENCE-END> 

enter octavius antony and their army <SENTENCE-END> 

  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  now antony our hopes are answered <SENTENCE-END> 
    you said the enemy would not come down
    but keep the hills and upper regions <SENTENCE-END> 
    it proves not so <SENTENCE-END>  their battles are at hand
    they mean to warn us at philippi here
    answering before we do demand of them <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  tut i am in their bosoms and i know
    wherefore they do it <SENTENCE-END>  they could be content
    to visit other places and come down
    with fearful bravery thinking by this face
    to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
    but tis not so <SENTENCE-END> 

                    enter a messenger <SENTENCE-END> 

  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  prepare you generals <SENTENCE-END> 
    the enemy comes on in gallant show  
    their bloody sign of battle is hung out
    and something to be done immediately <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  octavius lead your battle softly on
    upon the left hand of the even field <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  upon the right hand i keep thou the left <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  why do you cross me in this exigent
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  i do not cross you but i will do so <SENTENCE-END> 

      march <SENTENCE-END>  drum <SENTENCE-END>  enter brutus cassius and their army
           lucilius titinius messala and others <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  they stand and would have parley <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  stand fast titinius we must out and talk <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  mark antony shall we give sign of battle
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  no caesar we will answer on their charge <SENTENCE-END> 
    make forth the generals would have some words <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  stir not until the signal not until the signal <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  words before blows <SENTENCE-END>  is it so countrymen
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  not that we love words better as you do <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  good words are better than bad strokes octavius <SENTENCE-END>   
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  in your bad strokes brutus you give good words <SENTENCE-END> 
    witness the hole you made in caesars heart
    crying long live hail caesar
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  antony
    the posture of your blows are yet unknown
    but for your words they rob the hybla bees
    and leave them honeyless <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  not stingless too <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o yes and soundless too
    for you have stoln their buzzing antony
    and very wisely threat before you sting <SENTENCE-END> 
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  villains you did not so when your vile daggers
    hackd one another in the sides of caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
    you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds
    and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet
    whilst damned casca like a cur behind
    strooke caesar on the neck <SENTENCE-END>  o you flatterers
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  flatterers now brutus thank yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
    this tongue had not offended so today
    if cassius might have ruled <SENTENCE-END>   
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  come come the cause <SENTENCE-END>  if arguing make us sweat
    the proof of it will turn to redder drops <SENTENCE-END> 
    look
    i draw a sword against conspirators
    when think you that the sword goes up again
    never till caesars three and thirty wounds
    be well avenged or till another caesar
    have added slaughter to the sword of traitors <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
    unless thou bringst them with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  so i hope
    i was not born to die on brutus sword <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
    young man thou couldst not die more honorable <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  a peevish school boy worthless of such honor
    joind with a masker and a reveler
  antony <SENTENCE-END>  old cassius still
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  come antony away
    defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you dare fight today come to the field  
    if not when you have stomachs <SENTENCE-END> 
                        exeunt octavius antony and their army <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
    the storm is up and all is on the hazard <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  ho lucilius hark a word with you <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucilius <SENTENCE-END>  stands forth <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
                             brutus and lucilius converse apart <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  messala
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  stands forth <SENTENCE-END>  what says my general
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  messala
    this is my birthday as this very day
    was cassius born <SENTENCE-END>  give me thy hand messala <SENTENCE-END> 
    be thou my witness that against my will
    as pompey was am i compelld to set
    upon one battle all our liberties <SENTENCE-END> 
    you know that i held epicurus strong
    and his opinion <SENTENCE-END>  now i change my mind
    and partly credit things that do presage <SENTENCE-END> 
    coming from sardis on our former ensign
    two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd  
    gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
    who to philippi here consorted us <SENTENCE-END> 
    this morning are they fled away and gone
    and in their steads do ravens crows and kites
    fly oer our heads and downward look on us
    as we were sickly prey <SENTENCE-END>  their shadows seem
    a canopy most fatal under which
    our army lies ready to give up the ghost <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  believe not so <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  i but believe it partly
    for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
    to meet all perils very constantly <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  even so lucilius <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  now most noble brutus
    the gods today stand friendly that we may
    lovers in peace lead on our days to age
    but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
    lets reason with the worst that may befall <SENTENCE-END> 
    if we do lose this battle then is this
    the very last time we shall speak together <SENTENCE-END>   
    what are you then determined to do
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  even by the rule of that philosophy
    by which i did blame cato for the death
    which he did give himself i know not how
    but i do find it cowardly and vile
    for fear of what might fall so to prevent
    the time of life arming myself with patience
    to stay the providence of some high powers
    that govern us below <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  then if we lose this battle
    you are contented to be led in triumph
    thorough the streets of rome
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  no cassius no <SENTENCE-END>  think not thou noble roman
    that ever brutus will go bound to rome
    he bears too great a mind <SENTENCE-END>  but this same day
    must end that work the ides of march begun <SENTENCE-END> 
    and whether we shall meet again i know not <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore our everlasting farewell take <SENTENCE-END> 
    forever and forever farewell cassius
    if we do meet again why we shall smile  
    if not why then this parting was well made <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  forever and forever farewell brutus
    if we do meet again well smile indeed
    if not tis true this parting was well made <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  why then lead on <SENTENCE-END>  o that a man might know
    the end of this days business ere it come
    but it sufficeth that the day will end
    and then the end is known <SENTENCE-END>  come ho away           exeunt <SENTENCE-END> 




scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
the field of battle <SENTENCE-END> 

alarum <SENTENCE-END>  enter brutus and messala <SENTENCE-END> 

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  ride ride messala ride and give these bills
    unto the legions on the other side <SENTENCE-END>              loud alarum <SENTENCE-END> 
    let them set on at once for i perceive
    but cold demeanor in octavias wing
    and sudden push gives them the overthrow <SENTENCE-END> 
    ride ride messala <SENTENCE-END>  let them all come down <SENTENCE-END>          exeunt <SENTENCE-END> 




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
another part of the field <SENTENCE-END> 

alarums <SENTENCE-END>  enter cassius and titinius <SENTENCE-END> 

  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  o look titinius look the villains fly
    myself have to mine own turnd enemy <SENTENCE-END> 
    this ensign here of mine was turning back
    i slew the coward and did take it from him <SENTENCE-END> 
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  o cassius brutus gave the word too early
    who having some advantage on octavius
    took it too eagerly <SENTENCE-END>  his soldiers fell to spoil
    whilst we by antony are all enclosed <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter pindarus <SENTENCE-END> 

  pindarus <SENTENCE-END>  fly further off my lord fly further off
    mark antony is in your tents my lord
    fly therefore noble cassius fly far off <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  this hill is far enough <SENTENCE-END>  look look titinius
    are those my tents where i perceive the fire
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  they are my lord <SENTENCE-END>   
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  titinius if thou lovest me
    mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
    till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
    and here again that i may rest assured
    whether yond troops are friend or enemy <SENTENCE-END> 
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  i will be here again even with a thought <SENTENCE-END>      exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  go pindarus get higher on that hill
    my sight was ever thick regard titinius
    and tell me what thou notest about the field <SENTENCE-END> 
                                      pindarus ascends the hill <SENTENCE-END> 
    this day i breathed first time is come round
    and where i did begin there shall i end
    my life is run his compass <SENTENCE-END>  sirrah what news
  pindarus <SENTENCE-END>  above <SENTENCE-END>  o my lord
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  what news
  pindarus <SENTENCE-END>  above <SENTENCE-END>  titinius is enclosed round about
    with horsemen that make to him on the spur
    yet he spurs on <SENTENCE-END>  now they are almost on him <SENTENCE-END> 
    now titinius now some light <SENTENCE-END>  o he lights too <SENTENCE-END> 
    hes taen shout <SENTENCE-END>  and hark they shout for joy <SENTENCE-END>   
  cassius <SENTENCE-END>  come down behold no more <SENTENCE-END> 
    o coward that i am to live so long
    to see my best friend taen before my face
                                              pindarus descends <SENTENCE-END> 
    come hither sirrah <SENTENCE-END> 
    in parthia did i take thee prisoner
    and then i swore thee saving of thy life
    that whatsoever i did bid thee do
    thou shouldst attempt it <SENTENCE-END>  come now keep thine oath
    now be a freeman and with this good sword
    that ran through caesars bowels search this bosom <SENTENCE-END> 
    stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
    and when my face is coverd as tis now
    guide thou the sword <SENTENCE-END>  pindarus stabs him <SENTENCE-END>  caesar thou art
      revenged
    even with the sword that killd thee <SENTENCE-END>                   dies <SENTENCE-END> 
  pindarus <SENTENCE-END>  so i am free yet would not so have been
    durst i have done my will <SENTENCE-END>  o cassius
    far from this country pindarus shall run
    where never roman shall take note of him <SENTENCE-END>               exit <SENTENCE-END>   

                reenter titinius with messala <SENTENCE-END> 

  messala <SENTENCE-END>  it is but change titinius for octavius
    is overthrown by noble brutus power
    as cassius legions are by antony <SENTENCE-END> 
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  these tidings would well comfort cassius <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  where did you leave him
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  all disconsolate
    with pindarus his bondman on this hill <SENTENCE-END> 
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  is not that he that lies upon the ground
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  he lies not like the living <SENTENCE-END>  o my heart
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  is not that he
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  no this was he messala
    but cassius is no more <SENTENCE-END>  o setting sun
    as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
    so in his red blood cassius day is set
    the sun of rome is set our day is gone
    clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
    mistrust of my success hath done this deed <SENTENCE-END>   
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  mistrust of good success hath done this deed <SENTENCE-END> 
    o hateful error melancholys child
    why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
    the things that are not o error soon conceived
    thou never comest unto a happy birth
    but killst the mother that engenderd thee
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  what pindarus where art thou pindarus
  messala <SENTENCE-END>  seek him titinius whilst i go to meet
    the noble brutus thrusting this report
    into his ears <SENTENCE-END>  i may say thrusting it
    for piercing steel and darts envenomed
    shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
    as tidings of this sight <SENTENCE-END> 
  titinius <SENTENCE-END>  hie you messala
    and i will seek for pindarus the while <SENTENCE-END>         exit messala <SENTENCE-END> 
    why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
    did i not meet thy friends and did not they
    put on my brows this wreath of victory
    and bid me give it thee didst thou not hear their shouts
    alas thou hast misconstrued everything  
    but hold thee take this garland on thy brow
    thy brutus bid me give it thee and i
    will do his bidding <SENTENCE-END>  brutus come apace
    and see how i regarded caius cassius <SENTENCE-END> 
    by your leave gods this is a romans part <SENTENCE-END> 
    come cassius sword and find titinius heart <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                  kills himself <SENTENCE-END>

  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  titinius face is upward <SENTENCE-END> 
  cato <SENTENCE-END>  he is slain <SENTENCE-END> 
  brutus <SENTENCE-END>  o julius caesar thou art mighty yet
    thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
    in our own proper entrails <SENTENCE-END>                      low alarums <SENTENCE-END> 
  cato <SENTENCE-END>  brave titinius
    look wheer he have not crownd dead cassius

    should breed thy fellow <SENTENCE-END>  friends i owe moe tears
    to this dead man than you shall see me pay <SENTENCE-END> 
    i shall find time cassius i shall find time <SENTENCE-END> 
    come therefore and to thasos send his body
    his funerals shall not be in our camp
    lest it discomfort us <SENTENCE-END>  lucilius come
    and come young cato let us to the field <SENTENCE-END>

    did that they did in envy of great caesar
    he only in a general honest thought
    and common good to all made one of them <SENTENCE-END> 
    his life was gentle and the elements
    so mixd in him that nature might stand up
    and say to all the world this was a man
  octavius <SENTENCE-END>  according to his virtue let us use him
    with all respect and rites of burial <SENTENCE-END> 
    within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
    most like a soldier ordered honorably <SENTENCE-END>

    to part the glories of this happy day <SENTENCE-END>               exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

  glou <SENTENCE-END>  heres france and burgundy my noble lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  lear <SENTENCE-END>  my lord of burgundy
     we first address toward you who with this king
     hath rivalld for our daughter <SENTENCE-END>  what in the least
     will you require in present dower with her
     or cease your quest of love
  bur <SENTENCE-END>  most royal majesty
     i crave no more than hath your highness offerd
     nor will you tender less <SENTENCE-END> 
  lear <SENTENCE-END>  right noble burgundy
     when she was dear to us we did hold her so
     but now her price is falln <SENTENCE-END>  sir there she stands <SENTENCE-END> 
     if aught within that little seeming substance
     or all of it with our displeasure piecd  
     and nothing more may fitly like your grace
     shes there and she is yours <SENTENCE-END> 
  bur <SENTENCE-END>  i know no answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  lear <SENTENCE-END>  will you with those infirmities she owes
     unfriended new adopted to our hate
     dowrd with our curse and strangerd with our oath
     take her or leave her
  bur <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me royal sir <SENTENCE-END> 
     election makes not up on such conditions <SENTENCE-END> 
  lear <SENTENCE-END>  then leave her sir for by the powr that made me
     i tell you all her wealth <SENTENCE-END>  to france for you great king
     i would not from your love make such a stray
     to match you where i hate therefore beseech you
     t avert your liking a more worthier way
     than on a wretch whom nature is ashamd
     almost t acknowledge hers <SENTENCE-END> 
  france <SENTENCE-END>  this is most strange
     that she that even but now was your best object
     the argument of your praise balm of your age
     most best most dearest should in this trice of time  
     commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
     so many folds of favour <SENTENCE-END>  sure her offence
     must be of such unnatural degree
     that monsters it or your forevouchd affection
     falln into taint which to believe of her
     must be a faith that reason without miracle
     should never plant in me <SENTENCE-END> 
  cor <SENTENCE-END>  i yet beseech your majesty
     if for i want that glib and oily art
     to speak and purpose not since what i well intend
     ill dot before i speak that you make known
     it is no vicious blot murther or foulness
     no unchaste action or dishonoured step
     that hath deprivd me of your grace and favour
     but even for want of that for which i am richer
     a stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue
     as i am glad i have not though not to have it
     hath lost me in your liking <SENTENCE-END> 
  lear <SENTENCE-END>  better thou
     hadst not been born than not t have pleasd me better <SENTENCE-END>   
  france <SENTENCE-END>  is it but this a tardiness in nature
     which often leaves the history unspoke
     that it intends to do my lord of burgundy
     what say you to the lady loves not love

     knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance
     drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforcd obedience of
     planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine
     thrusting on <SENTENCE-END>  an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay
     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star my father

     either in snuffs and packings of the dukes
     or the hard rein which both of them have borne
     against the old kind king or something deeper
     whereof perchance these are but furnishings
     but true it is from france there comes a power

scene
navarre


act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
navarre <SENTENCE-END>  the kings park

enter the king berowne longaville and dumain

  king <SENTENCE-END>  let fame that all hunt after in their lives
    live registred upon our brazen tombs
    and then grace us in the disgrace of death
    when spite of cormorant devouring time
    th endeavour of this present breath may buy
    that honour which shall bate his scythes keen edge
    and make us heirs of all eternity <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore brave conquerors for so you are
    that war against your own affections
    and the huge army of the worlds desires
    our late edict shall strongly stand in force
    navarre shall be the wonder of the world
    our court shall be a little academe
    still and contemplative in living art <SENTENCE-END> 
    you three berowne dumain and longaville
    have sworn for three years term to live with me
    my fellowscholars and to keep those statutes  
    that are recorded in this schedule here <SENTENCE-END> 
    your oaths are passd and now subscribe your names
    that his own hand may strike his honour down
    that violates the smallest branch herein <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you are armd to do as sworn to do
    subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  i am resolvd tis but a three years fast <SENTENCE-END> 
    the mind shall banquet though the body pine <SENTENCE-END> 
    fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
    make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  my loving lord dumain is mortified <SENTENCE-END> 
    the grosser manner of these worlds delights
    he throws upon the gross worlds baser slaves
    to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die
    with all these living in philosophy <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  i can but say their protestation over
    so much dear liege i have already sworn
    that is to live and study here three years <SENTENCE-END> 
    but there are other strict observances
    as not to see a woman in that term  
    which i hope well is not enrolled there
    and one day in a week to touch no food
    and but one meal on every day beside
    the which i hope is not enrolled there
    and then to sleep but three hours in the night
    and not be seen to wink of all the day
    when i was wont to think no harm all night
    and make a dark night too of half the day
    which i hope well is not enrolled there <SENTENCE-END> 
    o these are barren tasks too hard to keep
    not to see ladies study fast not sleep
  king <SENTENCE-END>  your oath is passd to pass away from these <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  let me say no my liege an if you please
    i only swore to study with your grace
    and stay here in your court for three years space <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  you swore to that berowne and to the rest <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest <SENTENCE-END> 
    what is the end of study let me know <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  why that to know which else we should not know <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  things hid and barrd you mean from common sense  
  king <SENTENCE-END>  ay that is studys godlike recompense <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  come on then i will swear to study so
    to know the thing i am forbid to know
    as thus to study where i well may dine
    when i to feast expressly am forbid
    or study where to meet some mistress fine
    when mistresses from common sense are hid
    or having sworn too hardakeeping oath
    study to break it and not break my troth <SENTENCE-END> 
    if studys gain be thus and this be so
    study knows that which yet it doth not know <SENTENCE-END> 
    swear me to this and i will neer say no <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  these be the stops that hinder study quite
    and train our intellects to vain delight <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  why all delights are vain but that most vain
    which with pain purchasd doth inherit pain
    as painfully to pore upon a book
    to seek the light of truth while truth the while
    doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look <SENTENCE-END> 
    light seeking light doth light of light beguile  
    so ere you find where light in darkness lies
    your light grows dark by losing of your eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    study me how to please the eye indeed
    by fixing it upon a fairer eye
    who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
    and give him light that it was blinded by <SENTENCE-END> 
    study is like the heavens glorious sun
    that will not be deepsearchd with saucy looks
    small have continual plodders ever won
    save base authority from others books <SENTENCE-END> 
    these earthly godfathers of heavens lights
    that give a name to every fixed star
    have no more profit of their shining nights
    than those that walk and wot not what they are <SENTENCE-END> 
    too much to know is to know nought but fame
    and every godfather can give a name <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  how well hes read to reason against reading
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  the spring is near when green geese are abreeding <SENTENCE-END>   
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  how follows that
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  fit in his place and time <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  in reason nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  something then in rhyme <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
    that bites the firstborn infants of the spring <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  well say i am why should proud summer boast
    before the birds have any cause to sing
    why should i joy in any abortive birth
    at christmas i no more desire a rose
    than wish a snow in mays newfangled shows
    but like of each thing that in season grows
    so you to study now it is too late
    climb oer the house to unlock the little gate <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  well sit out go home berowne adieu <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you
    and though i have for barbarism spoke more
    than for that angel knowledge you can say
    yet confident ill keep what i have swore
    and bide the penance of each three years day <SENTENCE-END>   
    give me the paper let me read the same
    and to the strictest decrees ill write my name <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  reads item <SENTENCE-END>  that no woman shall come within a mile of
    my court hath this been proclaimed
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  four days ago <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  lets see the penalty <SENTENCE-END>  reads on pain of losing her
    tongue <SENTENCE-END>  who devisd this penalty
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  marry that did i <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  sweet lord and why
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  to fright them hence with that dread penalty <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  a dangerous law against gentility <SENTENCE-END> 
    reads item <SENTENCE-END>  if any man be seen to talk with a woman within
    the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the
    rest of the court can possibly devise <SENTENCE-END> 
    this article my liege yourself must break
    for well you know here comes in embassy
    the french kings daughter with yourself to speak
    a mild of grace and complete majesty
    about surrender up of aquitaine  
    to her decrepit sick and bedrid father
    therefore this article is made in vain
    or vainly comes th admired princess hither <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  what say you lords why this was quite forgot <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  so study evermore is overshot <SENTENCE-END> 
    while it doth study to have what it would
    it doth forget to do the thing it should
    and when it hath the thing it hunteth most
    tis won as towns with fire so won so lost <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  we must of force dispense with this decree
    she must lie here on mere necessity <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  necessity will make us all forsworn
    three thousand times within this three years space
    for every man with his affects is born
    not by might mastred but by special grace <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i break faith this word shall speak for me
    i am forsworn on mere necessity <SENTENCE-END> 
    so to the laws at large i write my name        subscribes
    and he that breaks them in the least degree
    stands in attainder of eternal shame <SENTENCE-END>   
    suggestions are to other as to me
    but i believe although i seem so loath
    i am the last that will last keep his oath <SENTENCE-END> 
    but is there no quick recreation granted
  king <SENTENCE-END>  ay that there is <SENTENCE-END>  our court you know is haunted
    with a refined traveller of spain
    a man in all the worlds new fashion planted
    that hath a mint of phrases in his brain
    one who the music of his own vain tongue
    doth ravish like enchanting harmony
    a man of complements whom right and wrong
    have chose as umpire of their mutiny <SENTENCE-END> 
    this child of fancy that armado hight
    for interim to our studies shall relate
    in highborn words the worth of many a knight
    from tawny spain lost in the worlds debate <SENTENCE-END> 
    how you delight my lords i know not i
    but i protest i love to hear him lie
    and i will use him for my minstrelsy <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  armado is a most illustrious wight  
    a man of firenew words fashions own knight <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  costard the swain and he shall be our sport
    and so to study three years is but short <SENTENCE-END>

  armado <SENTENCE-END>  why tough signior why tough signior
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  why tender juvenal why tender juvenal
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  i spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton
    appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tender <SENTENCE-END> 
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  and i tough signior as an appertinent title to your old
    time which we may name tough <SENTENCE-END>

  moth <SENTENCE-END>  you may do it in an hour sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  impossible <SENTENCE-END> 
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  how many is one thrice told

  moth <SENTENCE-END>  then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuceace
    amounts to <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  it doth amount to one more than two <SENTENCE-END> 
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  which the base vulgar do call three <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  true <SENTENCE-END> 
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  why sir is this such a piece of study now here is three
    studied ere yell thrice wink and how easy it is to put years
    to the word three and study three years in two words the
    dancing horse will tell you <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  a most fine figure
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  aside to prove you a cipher <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  i will hereupon confess i am in love <SENTENCE-END>  and as it is base for
    a soldier to love so am i in love with a base wench <SENTENCE-END>  if drawing
    my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
    the reprobate thought of it i would take desire prisoner and
    ransom him to any french courtier for a newdevisd curtsy <SENTENCE-END>  i
    think scorn to sigh methinks i should outswear cupid <SENTENCE-END>  comfort

    porter and he was in love <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  o wellknit samson strongjointed samson i do excel thee
    in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates <SENTENCE-END>  i am in

  armado <SENTENCE-END>  is that one of the four complexions
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  as i have read sir and the best of them too <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love
    of that colour methinks samson had small reason for it <SENTENCE-END>  he
    surely affected her for her wit <SENTENCE-END> 
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  it was so sir for she had a green wit <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  my love is most immaculate white and red <SENTENCE-END>

  moth <SENTENCE-END>       if she be made of white and red
               her faults will neer be known
             for blushing cheeks by faults are bred
               and fears by pale white shown <SENTENCE-END> 
             then if she fear or be to blame
               by this you shall not know
             for still her cheeks possess the same
               which native she doth owe <SENTENCE-END> 
    a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of white and red <SENTENCE-END> 
  armado <SENTENCE-END>  is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar
  moth <SENTENCE-END>  the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
    since but i think now tis not to be found or if it were it

    love is a familiar love is a devil <SENTENCE-END>  there is no evil angel but
    love <SENTENCE-END>  yet was samson so tempted and he had an excellent
    strength yet was solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit <SENTENCE-END> 
    cupids buttshaft is too hard for hercules club and therefore
    too much odds for a spaniards rapier <SENTENCE-END>  the first and second cause

rosaline maria katharine boyet and two other lords

  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  now madam summon up your dearest spirits <SENTENCE-END> 
    consider who the king your father sends
    to whom he sends and whats his embassy
    yourself held precious in the worlds esteem
    to parley with the sole inheritor
    of all perfections that a man may owe
    matchless navarre the plea of no less weight
    than aquitaine a dowry for a queen <SENTENCE-END> 
    be now as prodigal of all dear grace
    as nature was in making graces dear
    when she did starve the general world beside
    and prodigally gave them all to you <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  good lord boyet my beauty though but mean
    needs not the painted flourish of your praise <SENTENCE-END> 
    beauty is bought by judgment of the eye
    not uttred by base sale of chapmens tongues  
    i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
    than you much willing to be counted wise
    in spending your wit in the praise of mine <SENTENCE-END> 
    but now to task the tasker good boyet
    you are not ignorant alltelling fame
    doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow
    till painful study shall outwear three years

    therefore tos seemeth it a needful course
    before we enter his forbidden gates
    to know his pleasure and in that behalf
    bold of your worthiness we single you
    as our bestmoving fair solicitor <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell him the daughter of the king of france
    on serious business craving quick dispatch
    importunes personal conference with his grace <SENTENCE-END>

    like humblevisagd suitors his high will <SENTENCE-END>

    well fitted in arts glorious in arms
    nothing becomes him ill that he would well <SENTENCE-END> 
    the only soil of his fair virtues gloss

act iv <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
the park

enter the princess rosaline maria katharine boyet lords attendants
and a forester

  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  was that the king that spurrd his horse so
      hard
    against the steep uprising of the hill
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  i know not but i think it was not he <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  whoeer a was a showd a mounting mind <SENTENCE-END> 
    well lords today we shall have our dispatch
    on saturday we will return to france <SENTENCE-END> 
    then forester my friend where is the bush
    that we must stand and play the murderer in
  forester <SENTENCE-END>  hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
    a stand where you may make the fairest shoot <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot
    and thereupon thou speakst the fairest shoot <SENTENCE-END> 
  forester <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me madam for i meant not so <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  what what first praise me and again say no
    o shortlivd pride not fair alack for woe  
  forester <SENTENCE-END>  yes madam fair <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  nay never paint me now
    where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow <SENTENCE-END> 
    here good my glass take this for telling true
                                              giving him money
    fair payment for foul words is more than due <SENTENCE-END> 
  forester <SENTENCE-END>  nothing but fair is that which you inherit <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  see see my beauty will be savd by merit <SENTENCE-END> 
    o heresy in fair fit for these days
    a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise <SENTENCE-END> 
    but come the bow <SENTENCE-END>  now mercy goes to kill
    and shooting well is then accounted ill
    thus will i save my credit in the shoot
    not wounding pity would not let me dot
    if wounding then it was to show my skill
    that more for praise than purpose meant to kill <SENTENCE-END> 
    and out of question so it is sometimes
    glory grows guilty of detested crimes
    when for fames sake for praise an outward part
    we bend to that the working of the heart  
    as i for praise alone now seek to spill
    the poor deers blood that my heart means no ill <SENTENCE-END> 
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
    only for praise sake when they strive to be
    lords oer their lords
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  only for praise and praise we may afford
    to any lady that subdues a lord <SENTENCE-END>

scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
the park

from the shooting within enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull

  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  very reverent sport truly and done in the testimony of
    a good conscience <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe as
    the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo
    the sky the welkin the heaven and anon falleth like a crab on
    the face of terra the soil the land the earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly
    varied like a scholar at the least but sir i assure ye it was
    a buck of the first head <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  sir nathaniel haud credo <SENTENCE-END> 
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  twas not a haud credo twas a pricket <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  most barbarous intimation yet a kind of insinuation
    as it were in via in way of explication facere as it were
    replication or rather ostentare to show as it were his
    inclination after his undressed unpolished uneducated
    unpruned untrained or rather unlettered or ratherest  
    unconfirmed fashion to insert again my haud credo for a deer <SENTENCE-END> 
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  twicesod simplicity bis coctus
    o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look
  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in
      a book
    he hath not eat paper as it were he hath not drunk ink his
    intellect is not replenished he is only an animal only sensible
    in the duller parts
    and such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should
      be
    which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that do
      fructify in us more than he <SENTENCE-END> 
    for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
    so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school <SENTENCE-END> 
    but omne bene say i being of an old fathers mind
    many can brook the weather that love not the wind <SENTENCE-END> 
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  you two are bookmen can you tell me by your wit
    what was a month old at cains birth thats not five weeks old as
      yet  
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull <SENTENCE-END> 
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  what is dictynna
  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  a title to phoebe to luna to the moon <SENTENCE-END>

    and raught not to five weeks when he came to fivescore <SENTENCE-END> 
    th allusion holds in the exchange <SENTENCE-END> 
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  god comfort thy capacity i say th allusion holds in
    the exchange <SENTENCE-END> 
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  and i say the polusion holds in the exchange for the moon is
    never but a month old and i say beside that twas a pricket
    that the princess killd <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
    the death of the deer and to humour the ignorant call the deer
    the princess killd a pricket <SENTENCE-END> 
  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  perge good master holofernes perge so it shall please
    you to abrogate scurrility <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  i will something affect the letter for it argues
    facility <SENTENCE-END> 
  
    the preyful princess piercd and prickd a pretty pleasing
      pricket <SENTENCE-END> 
    some say a sore but not a sore till now made sore with shooting <SENTENCE-END> 
    the dogs did yell put el to sore then sorel jumps from thicket
    or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall ahooting <SENTENCE-END> 
    if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores o sorel <SENTENCE-END> 
    of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l <SENTENCE-END> 

  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  a rare talent
  dull <SENTENCE-END>  aside if a talent be a claw look how he claws him with a
    talent <SENTENCE-END> 
  holofernes <SENTENCE-END>  this is a gift that i have simple simple a foolish
    extravagant spirit full of forms figures shapes objects
    ideas apprehensions motions revolutions <SENTENCE-END>  these are begot in
    the ventricle of memory nourishd in the womb of pia mater and
    delivered upon the mellowing of occasion <SENTENCE-END>  but the gift is good in
    those in whom it is acute and i am thankful for it <SENTENCE-END> 
  nathaniel <SENTENCE-END>  sir i praise the lord for you and so may my
    parishioners for their sons are well tutord by you and their
    daughters profit very greatly under you <SENTENCE-END>  you are a good member of  
    the commonwealth <SENTENCE-END>

    smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy the jerks of
    invention imitari is nothing so doth the hound his master the

      to those fresh morning drops upon the rose
      as thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote
      the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
      nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
      through the transparent bosom of the deep
      as doth thy face through tears of mine give light <SENTENCE-END> 
      thou shinst in every tear that i do weep
      no drop but as a coach doth carry thee
      so ridest thou triumphing in my woe <SENTENCE-END> 
      do but behold the tears that swell in me
      and they thy glory through my grief will show <SENTENCE-END> 
      but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep  
      my tears for glasses and still make me weep <SENTENCE-END>

  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  am i the first that have been perjurd so
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know
    thou makest the triumviry the cornercap of society
    the shape of loves tyburn that hangs up simplicity <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move <SENTENCE-END>   
    o sweet maria empress of my love

  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  this same shall go <SENTENCE-END>           he reads the sonnet
      did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
      gainst whom the world cannot hold argument
      persuade my heart to this false perjury
      vows for thee broke deserve not punishment <SENTENCE-END> 
      a woman i forswore but i will prove
      thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
      my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
      thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me <SENTENCE-END>

      if broken then it is no fault of mine
      if by me broke what fool is not so wise
      to lose an oath to win a paradise

  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  o that i had my wish
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  and i had mine

  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  amen so i had mine is not that a good word

    would let her out in saucers <SENTENCE-END>  sweet misprision
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  once more ill read the ode that i have writ <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  once more ill mark how love can vary wit <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  reads
        on a dayalack the day
        love whose month is ever may
        spied a blossom passing fair
        playing in the wanton air <SENTENCE-END> 
        through the velvet leaves the wind
        all unseen can passage find  
        that the lover sick to death
        wishd himself the heavens breath <SENTENCE-END> 
        air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
        air would i might triumph so
        but alack my hand is sworn
        neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
        vow alack for youth unmeet
        youth so apt to pluck a sweet <SENTENCE-END> 
        do not call it sin in me
        that i am forsworn for thee
        thou for whom jove would swear
        juno but an ethiope were
        and deny himself for jove
        turning mortal for thy love <SENTENCE-END> 
    this will i send and something else more plain
    that shall express my true loves fasting pain <SENTENCE-END> 
    o would the king berowne and longaville
    were lovers too ill to example ill
    would from my forehead wipe a perjurd note
    for none offend where all alike do dote <SENTENCE-END>   
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  advancing dumain thy love is far from charity
    that in loves grief desirst society
    you may look pale but i should blush i know
    to be oerheard and taken napping so <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such <SENTENCE-END> 
    you chide at him offending twice as much
    you do not love maria longaville
    did never sonnet for her sake compile
    nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
    his loving bosom to keep down his heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have been closely shrouded in this bush
    and markd you both and for you both did blush <SENTENCE-END> 
    i heard your guilty rhymes observd your fashion
    saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion <SENTENCE-END> 
    ay me says one <SENTENCE-END>  o jove the other cries <SENTENCE-END> 
    one her hairs were gold crystal the others eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    to longaville you would for paradise break faith and troth
    to dumain and jove for your love would infringe an oath <SENTENCE-END> 
    what will berowne say when that he shall hear
    faith infringed which such zeal did swear  
    how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
    how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
    for all the wealth that ever i did see
    i would not have him know so much by me <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  descending now step i forth to whip hypocrisy
    ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me <SENTENCE-END> 
    good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
    these worms for loving that art most in love
    your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
    there is no certain princess that appears
    youll not be perjurd tis a hateful thing
    tush none but minstrels like of sonneting <SENTENCE-END> 
    but are you not ashamed nay are you not
    all three of you to be thus much oershot
    you found his mote the king your mote did see
    but i a beam do find in each of three <SENTENCE-END> 
    o what a scene of foolry have i seen
    of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
    o me with what strict patience have i sat
    to see a king transformed to a gnat  
    to see great hercules whipping a gig
    and profound solomon to tune a jig
    and nestor play at pushpin with the boys
    and critic timon laugh at idle toys
    where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
    and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
    and where my lieges all about the breast <SENTENCE-END> 
    a caudle ho
  king <SENTENCE-END>  too bitter is thy jest <SENTENCE-END> 
    are we betrayed thus to thy overview
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  not you by me but i betrayed to you <SENTENCE-END> 
    i that am honest i that hold it sin
    to break the vow i am engaged in
    i am betrayed by keeping company
    with men like you men of inconstancy <SENTENCE-END> 
    when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
    or groan for joan or spend a minutes time
    in pruning me when shall you hear that i
    will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
    a gait a state a brow a breast a waist  
    a leg a limb
  king <SENTENCE-END>  soft whither away so fast
    a true man or a thief that gallops so
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  i post from love good lover let me go <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter jaquenetta and costard

                                       gathering up the pieces
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>   to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born

  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  that you three fools lackd me fool to make up the mess
    he he and you and you my liege and i
    are pickpurses in love and we deserve to die <SENTENCE-END> 
    o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more <SENTENCE-END> 
    dumain <SENTENCE-END>  now the number is even <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  true true we are four <SENTENCE-END> 
    will these turtles be gone
  king <SENTENCE-END>  hence sirs away <SENTENCE-END>   
  costard <SENTENCE-END>  walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay <SENTENCE-END> 
                                   exeunt costard and jaquenetta
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
    as true we are as flesh and blood can be <SENTENCE-END> 
    the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
    young blood doth not obey an old decree <SENTENCE-END> 
    we cannot cross the cause why we were born
    therefore of all hands must we be forsworn <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  what did these rent lines show some love of thine
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  did they quoth you <SENTENCE-END>  who sees the heavenly rosaline
    that like a rude and savage man of inde
    at the first opning of the gorgeous east
    bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
    kisses the base ground with obedient breast
    what peremptory eaglesighted eye
    dares look upon the heaven of her brow
    that is not blinded by her majesty
  king <SENTENCE-END>  what zeal what fury hath inspird thee now
    my love her mistress is a gracious moon
    she an attending star scarce seen a light <SENTENCE-END>   
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  my eyes are then no eyes nor i berowne <SENTENCE-END> 
    o but for my love day would turn to night
    of all complexions the culld sovereignty
    do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
    where several worthies make one dignity
    where nothing wants that want itself doth seek <SENTENCE-END> 
    lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues
    fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not
    to things of sale a sellers praise belongs
    she passes praise then praise too short doth blot <SENTENCE-END> 
    a witherd hermit fivescore winters worn
    might shake off fifty looking in her eye <SENTENCE-END> 
    beauty doth varnish age as if newborn
    and gives the crutch the cradles infancy <SENTENCE-END> 
    o tis the sun that maketh all things shine
  king <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven thy love is black as ebony <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  is ebony like her o wood divine
    a wife of such wood were felicity <SENTENCE-END> 
    o who can give an oath where is a book
    that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack  
    if that she learn not of her eye to look <SENTENCE-END> 
    no face is fair that is not full so black <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  o paradox black is the badge of hell
    the hue of dungeons and the school of night
    and beautys crest becomes the heavens well <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light <SENTENCE-END> 
    o if in black my ladys brows be deckt
    it mourns that painting and usurping hair
    should ravish doters with a false aspect
    and therefore is she born to make black fair <SENTENCE-END> 
    her favour turns the fashion of the days
    for native blood is counted painting now
    and therefore red that would avoid dispraise
    paints itself black to imitate her brow <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  to look like her are chimneysweepers black <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  and since her time are colliers counted bright <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  dark needs no candles now for dark is light <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  your mistresses dare never come in rain
    for fear their colours should be washd away <SENTENCE-END>   
  king <SENTENCE-END>  twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain
    ill find a fairer face not washd today <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  ill prove her fair or talk till doomsday here <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  no devil will fright thee then so much as she <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  look heres thy love my foot and her face see <SENTENCE-END> 
                                              showing his shoe
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  o if the streets were paved with thine eyes
    her feet were much too dainty for such tread
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  o vile then as she goes what upward lies
    the street should see as she walkd overhead <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  but what of this are we not all in love
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  then leave this chat and good berowne now prove
    our loving lawful and our faith not torn <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  ay marry there some flattery for this evil <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  o some authority how to proceed
    some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  some salve for perjury <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  tis more than need <SENTENCE-END>   
    have at you then affections menatarms <SENTENCE-END> 
    consider what you first did swear unto
    to fast to study and to see no woman
    flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth <SENTENCE-END> 
    say can you fast your stomachs are too young
    and abstinence engenders maladies <SENTENCE-END> 
    and where that you you have vowd to study lords
    in that each of you have forsworn his book
    can you still dream and pore and thereon look
    for when would you my lord or you or you
    have found the ground of studys excellence
    without the beauty of a womans face
    from womens eyes this doctrine i derive
    they are the ground the books the academes
    from whence doth spring the true promethean fire <SENTENCE-END> 
    why universal plodding poisons up
    the nimble spirits in the arteries
    as motion and longduring action tires
    the sinewy vigour of the traveller <SENTENCE-END> 
    now for not looking on a womans face  
    you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
    and study too the causer of your vow
    for where is author in the world
    teaches such beauty as a womans eye
    learning is but an adjunct to ourself
    and where we are our learning likewise is
    then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes
    with ourselves <SENTENCE-END> 
    do we not likewise see our learning there
    o we have made a vow to study lords
    and in that vow we have forsworn our books <SENTENCE-END> 
    for when would you my liege or you or you
    in leaden contemplation have found out
    such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
    of beautys tutors have enrichd you with
    other slow arts entirely keep the brain
    and therefore finding barren practisers
    scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
    but love first learned in a ladys eyes
    lives not alone immured in the brain  
    but with the motion of all elements
    courses as swift as thought in every power
    and gives to every power a double power
    above their functions and their offices <SENTENCE-END> 
    it adds a precious seeing to the eye
    a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind <SENTENCE-END> 
    a lovers ear will hear the lowest sound
    when the suspicious head of theft is stoppd <SENTENCE-END> 
    loves feeling is more soft and sensible
    than are the tender horns of cockled snails
    loves tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste <SENTENCE-END> 
    for valour is not love a hercules
    still climbing trees in the hesperides
    subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical
    as bright apollos lute strung with his hair <SENTENCE-END> 
    and when love speaks the voice of all the gods
    make heaven drowsy with the harmony <SENTENCE-END> 
    never durst poet touch a pen to write
    until his ink were tempred with loves sighs
    o then his lines would ravish savage ears  
    and plant in tyrants mild humility <SENTENCE-END> 
    from womens eyes this doctrine i derive <SENTENCE-END> 
    they sparkle still the right promethean fire
    they are the books the arts the academes
    that show contain and nourish all the world
    else none at all in aught proves excellent <SENTENCE-END> 
    then fools you were these women to forswear
    or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools <SENTENCE-END> 
    for wisdoms sake a word that all men love
    or for loves sake a word that loves all men
    or for mens sake the authors of these women
    or womens sake by whom we men are men
    let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
    or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is religion to be thus forsworn
    for charity itself fulfils the law
    and who can sever love from charity
  king <SENTENCE-END>  saint cupid then and soldiers to the field
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  advance your standards and upon them lords
    pellmell down with them be first advisd  
    in conflict that you get the sun of them <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  now to plaindealing lay these glozes by <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall we resolve to woo these girls of france
  king <SENTENCE-END>  and win them too therefore let us devise
    some entertainment for them in their tents <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  first from the park let us conduct them thither
    then homeward every man attach the hand
    of his fair mistress <SENTENCE-END>  in the afternoon
    we will with some strange pastime solace them
    such as the shortness of the time can shape
    for revels dances masks and merry hours
    forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  away away no time shall be omitted
    that will betime and may by us be fitted <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  allons allons sowd cockle reapd no corn
    and justice always whirls in equal measure <SENTENCE-END> 
    light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
    if so our copper buys no better treasure <SENTENCE-END>             exeunt

    writ o both sides the leaf margent and all
    that he was fain to seal on cupids name <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  that was the way to make his godhead wax
    for he hath been five thousand year a boy <SENTENCE-END> 
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  youll neer be friends with him a killd your sister <SENTENCE-END> 
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  he made her melancholy sad and heavy
    and so she died <SENTENCE-END>  had she been light like you
    of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
    she might a been a grandam ere she died <SENTENCE-END>   
    and so may you for a light heart lives long <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  whats your dark meaning mouse of this light word
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  a light condition in a beauty dark <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  we need more light to find your meaning out <SENTENCE-END>

  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  so do not you for you are a light wench <SENTENCE-END>

  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  you weigh me not o thats you care not for me <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  great reason for past cure is still past care <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  well bandied both a set of wit well playd <SENTENCE-END> 
    but rosaline you have a favour too
    who sent it and what is it
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  i would you knew <SENTENCE-END> 
    an if my face were but as fair as yours
    my favour were as great be witness this <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay i have verses too i thank berowne
    the numbers true and were the numbring too
    i were the fairest goddess on the ground <SENTENCE-END>   
    i am compard to twenty thousand fairs <SENTENCE-END> 
    o he hath drawn my picture in his letter
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  anything like
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  much in the letters nothing in the praise <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  beauteous as ink a good conclusion <SENTENCE-END> 
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  fair as a text b in a copybook <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  ware pencils ho let me not die your debtor
    my red dominical my golden letter
    o that your face were not so full of os
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  a pox of that jest and i beshrew all shrows
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  but katharine what was sent to you from fair
    dumain
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  madam this glove <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  did he not send you twain
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  yes madam and moreover
    some thousand verses of a faithful lover
    a huge translation of hypocrisy
    vilely compild profound simplicity <SENTENCE-END> 
  maria <SENTENCE-END>  this and these pearl to me sent longaville
    the letter is too long by half a mile <SENTENCE-END>   
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  i think no less <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou not wish in heart
    the chain were longer and the letter short
  maria <SENTENCE-END>  ay or i would these hands might never part <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  we are wise girls to mock our lovers so <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  they are worse fools to purchase mocking so <SENTENCE-END> 
    that same berowne ill torture ere i go <SENTENCE-END> 
    o that i knew he were but in by th week
    how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
    and wait the season and observe the times
    and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
    and shape his service wholly to my hests
    and make him proud to make me proud that jests
    so pertauntlike would i oersway his state
    that he should be my fool and i his fate <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  none are so surely caught when they are
      catchd
    as wit turnd fool folly in wisdom hatchd
    hath wisdoms warrant and the help of school
    and wits own grace to grace a learned fool <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  the blood of youth burns not with such excess  
    as gravitys revolt to wantonness <SENTENCE-END> 
  maria <SENTENCE-END>  folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    as foolry in the wise when wit doth dote
    since all the power thereof it doth apply
    to prove by wit worth in simplicity <SENTENCE-END> 

                          enter boyet

  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  here comes boyet and mirth is in his face <SENTENCE-END> 
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  o i am stabbd with laughter wheres her grace
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  thy news boyet
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  prepare madam prepare
    arm wenches arm encounters mounted are
    against your peace <SENTENCE-END>  love doth approach disguisd
    armed in arguments youll be surprisd <SENTENCE-END> 
    muster your wits stand in your own defence
    or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  saint dennis to saint cupid what are they
    that charge their breath against us say scout say <SENTENCE-END> 
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  under the cool shade of a sycamore  
    i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
    when lo to interrupt my purposd rest
    toward that shade i might behold addrest
    the king and his companions warily
    i stole into a neighbour thicket by
    and overheard what you shall overhear
    that by and by disguisd they will be here <SENTENCE-END> 
    their herald is a pretty knavish page
    that well by heart hath connd his embassage <SENTENCE-END> 
    action and accent did they teach him there
    thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear
    and ever and anon they made a doubt
    presence majestical would put him out
    for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see
    yet fear not thou but speak audaciously <SENTENCE-END> 
    the boy replied an angel is not evil
    i should have feard her had she been a devil <SENTENCE-END> 
    with that all laughd and clappd him on the shoulder
    making the bold wag by their praises bolder <SENTENCE-END> 
    one rubbd his elbow thus and fleerd and swore  
    a better speech was never spoke before <SENTENCE-END> 
    another with his finger and his thumb
    cried via we will dot come what will come <SENTENCE-END> 
    the third he caperd and cried all goes well <SENTENCE-END> 
    the fourth turnd on the toe and down he fell <SENTENCE-END> 
    with that they all did tumble on the ground
    with such a zealous laughter so profound
    that in this spleen ridiculous appears
    to check their folly passions solemn tears <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  but what but what come they to visit us
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  they do they do and are apparelld thus
    like muscovites or russians as i guess <SENTENCE-END> 
    their purpose is to parley court and dance
    and every one his lovefeat will advance
    unto his several mistress which theyll know
    by favours several which they did bestow <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  and will they so the gallants shall be taskd
    for ladies we will every one be maskd
    and not a man of them shall have the grace
    despite of suit to see a ladys face <SENTENCE-END>   
    hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
    and then the king will court thee for his dear
    hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
    so shall berowne take me for rosaline <SENTENCE-END> 
    and change you favours too so shall your loves
    woo contrary deceivd by these removes <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  come on then wear the favours most in sight <SENTENCE-END> 
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  but in this changing what is your intent
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  the effect of my intent is to cross theirs <SENTENCE-END> 
    they do it but in mocking merriment
    and mock for mock is only my intent <SENTENCE-END> 
    their several counsels they unbosom shall
    to loves mistook and so be mockd withal
    upon the next occasion that we meet
    with visages displayd to talk and greet <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  but shall we dance if they desire us tot
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  no to the death we will not move a foot
    nor to their pennd speech render we no grace
    but while tis spoke each turn away her face <SENTENCE-END> 
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  why that contempt will kill the speakers heart  
    and quite divorce his memory from his part <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i do it and i make no doubt
    the rest will neer come in if he be out <SENTENCE-END> 
    theres no such sport as sport by sport oerthrown
    to make theirs ours and ours none but our own
    so shall we stay mocking intended game
    and they well mockd depart away with shame <SENTENCE-END> 
                                         trumpet sounds within
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  the trumpet sounds be maskd the maskers come <SENTENCE-END>

    to tread a measure with her on this grass <SENTENCE-END> 
  boyet <SENTENCE-END>  they say that they have measurd many a mile
    to tread a measure with you on this grass <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  it is not so <SENTENCE-END>  ask them how many inches

  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  prepare i say <SENTENCE-END>  i thank you gracious lords
    for all your fair endeavours and entreat
    out of a newsad soul that you vouchsafe
    in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
    the liberal opposition of our spirits
    if overboldly we have borne ourselves
    in the converse of breath your gentleness
    was guilty of it <SENTENCE-END>  farewell worthy lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
    excuse me so coming too short of thanks
    for my great suit so easily obtaind <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  the extreme parts of time extremely forms
    all causes to the purpose of his speed
    and often at his very loose decides  
    that which long process could not arbitrate <SENTENCE-END> 
    and though the mourning brow of progeny
    forbid the smiling courtesy of love
    the holy suit which fain it would convince
    yet since loves argument was first on foot
    let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
    from what it purposd since to wail friends lost
    is not by much so wholesomeprofitable
    as to rejoice at friends but newly found <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  i understand you not my griefs are double <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
    and by these badges understand the king <SENTENCE-END> 
    for your fair sakes have we neglected time
    playd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies
    hath much deformed us fashioning our humours
    even to the opposed end of our intents
    and what in us hath seemd ridiculous
    as love is full of unbefitting strains
    all wanton as a child skipping and vain
    formd by the eye and therefore like the eye  
    full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
    varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
    to every varied object in his glance
    which particoated presence of loose love
    put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
    have misbecomd our oaths and gravities
    those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
    suggested us to make <SENTENCE-END>  therefore ladies
    our love being yours the error that love makes
    is likewise yours <SENTENCE-END>  we to ourselves prove false
    by being once false for ever to be true
    to those that make us both fair ladies you
    and even that falsehood in itself a sin
    thus purifies itself and turns to grace <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  we have receivd your letters full of love
    your favours the ambassadors of love
    and in our maiden council rated them
    at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
    as bombast and as lining to the time
    but more devout than this in our respects  
    have we not been and therefore met your loves
    in their own fashion like a merriment <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  our letters madam showd much more than jest <SENTENCE-END> 
  longaville <SENTENCE-END>  so did our looks <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  we did not quote them so <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  now at the latest minute of the hour
    grant us your loves <SENTENCE-END> 
  princess of france <SENTENCE-END>  a time methinks too short
    to make a worldwithoutend bargain in <SENTENCE-END> 
    no no my lord your grace is perjurd much
    full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
    if for my love as there is no such cause
    you will do aught this shall you do for me
    your oath i will not trust but go with speed
    to some forlorn and naked hermitage
    remote from all the pleasures of the world
    there stay until the twelve celestial signs
    have brought about the annual reckoning <SENTENCE-END> 
    if this austere insociable life
    change not your offer made in heat of blood  
    if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
    nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
    but that it bear this trial and last love
    then at the expiration of the year
    come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
    and by this virgin palm now kissing thine
    i will be thine and till that instant shut
    my woeful self up in a mournful house
    raining the tears of lamentation
    for the remembrance of my fathers death <SENTENCE-END> 
    if this thou do deny let our hands part
    neither intitled in the others heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  king <SENTENCE-END>  if this or more than this i would deny
    to flatter up these powers of mine with rest
    the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
    hence hermit then my heart is in thy breast <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  and what to me my love and what to me
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  you must he purged too your sins are rackd
    you are attaint with faults and perjury
    therefore if you my favour mean to get  
    a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
    but seek the weary beds of people sick <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  but what to me my love but what to me

  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  a beard fair health and honesty
    with threefold love i wish you all these three <SENTENCE-END> 
  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  o shall i say i thank you gentle wife
  katharine <SENTENCE-END>  no so my lord a twelvemonth and a day

  dumain <SENTENCE-END>  ill serve thee true and faithfully till then <SENTENCE-END>

    behold the window of my heart mine eye  
    what humble suit attends thy answer there <SENTENCE-END> 
    impose some service on me for thy love <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  oft have i heard of you my lord berowne
    before i saw you and the worlds large tongue
    proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
    full of comparisons and wounding flouts
    which you on all estates will execute
    that lie within the mercy of your wit <SENTENCE-END> 
    to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
    and therewithal to win me if you please
    without the which i am not to be won
    you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
    visit the speechless sick and still converse
    with groaning wretches and your task shall be
    with all the fierce endeavour of your wit
    to enforce the pained impotent to smile <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  to move wild laughter in the throat of death
    it cannot be it is impossible
    mirth cannot move a soul in agony <SENTENCE-END> 
  rosaline <SENTENCE-END>  why thats the way to choke a gibing spirit  
    whose influence is begot of that loose grace
    which shallow laughing hearers give to fools <SENTENCE-END> 
    a jests prosperity lies in the ear
    of him that hears it never in the tongue
    of him that makes it then if sickly ears
    deafd with the clamours of their own dear groans
    will hear your idle scorns continue then
    and i will have you and that fault withal <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if they will not throw away that spirit
    and i shall find you empty of that fault
    right joyful of your reformation <SENTENCE-END> 
  berowne <SENTENCE-END>  a twelvemonth well befall what will befall
    ill jest a twelvemonth in an hospital <SENTENCE-END>

    for brave macbeth well he deserves that name
    disdaining fortune with his brandishd steel

    like valors minion carved out his passage

    which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him
    till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps

    came post with post and every one did bear
    thy praises in his kingdoms great defense
    and pourd them down before him <SENTENCE-END> 
  angus <SENTENCE-END>  we are sent
    to give thee from our royal master thanks
    only to herald thee into his sight
    not pay thee <SENTENCE-END>

    which he deserves to lose <SENTENCE-END>  whether he was combined
    with those of norway or did line the rebel
    with hidden help and vantage or that with both
    he labord in his countrys wreck i know not
    but treasons capital confessd and proved

    might yet enkindle you unto the crown
    besides the thane of cawdor <SENTENCE-END>  but tis strange

    in deepest consequence
    cousins a word i pray you <SENTENCE-END>

    cannot be ill cannot be good <SENTENCE-END>  if ill
    why hath it given me earnest of success
    commencing in a truth i am thane of cawdor <SENTENCE-END> 
    if good why do i yield to that suggestion
    whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
    and make my seated heart knock at my ribs
    against the use of nature present fears
    are less than horrible imaginings
    my thought whose murther yet is but fantastical
    shakes so my single state of man that function
    is smotherd in surmise and nothing is  
    but what is not <SENTENCE-END> 
  banquo <SENTENCE-END>  look how our partners rapt <SENTENCE-END>

    like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
    but with the aid of use <SENTENCE-END> 
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  aside <SENTENCE-END>  come what come may
    time and the hour runs through the roughest day <SENTENCE-END>

    golden opinions from all sorts of people
    which would be worn now in their newest gloss
    not cast aside so soon <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  was the hope drunk
    wherein you dressd yourself hath it slept since
    and wakes it now to look so green and pale
    at what it did so freely from this time
    such i account thy love <SENTENCE-END>  art thou afeard
    to be the same in thine own act and valor
    as thou art in desire wouldst thou have that
    which thou esteemst the ornament of life
    and live a coward in thine own esteem
    letting i dare not wait upon i would
    like the poor cat i the adage
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  prithee peace
    i dare do all that may become a man
    who dares do more is none <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  what beast wast then  
    that made you break this enterprise to me
    when you durst do it then you were a man
    and to be more than what you were you would
    be so much more the man <SENTENCE-END>  nor time nor place
    did then adhere and yet you would make both <SENTENCE-END> 
    they have made themselves and that their fitness now
    does unmake you <SENTENCE-END>  i have given suck and know
    how tender tis to love the babe that milks me
    i would while it was smiling in my face
    have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums
    and dashd the brains out had i so sworn as you
    have done to this <SENTENCE-END> 
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  if we should fail
  lady macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  we fail
    but screw your courage to the stickingplace
    and well not fail <SENTENCE-END>  when duncan is asleep
    whereto the rather shall his days hard journey
    soundly invite him his two chamberlains
    will i with wine and wassail so convince
    that memory the warder of the brain  
    shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
    a limbeck only <SENTENCE-END>  when in swinish sleep
    their drenched natures lie as in a death
    what cannot you and i perform upon
    the unguarded duncan what not put upon
    his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
    of our great quell
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  bring forth menchildren only
    for thy undaunted mettle should compose
    nothing but males <SENTENCE-END>  will it not be received
    when we have markd with blood those sleepy two
    of his own chamber and used their very daggers
    that they have donet
  lady macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  who dares receive it other
    as we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
    upon his death
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  i am settled and bend up
    each corporal agent to this terrible feat <SENTENCE-END> 
    away and mock the time with fairest show
    false face must hide what the false heart doth know <SENTENCE-END>   
                                                         exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

    and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
    which was not so before <SENTENCE-END>  theres no such thing
    it is the bloody business which informs
    thus to mine eyes <SENTENCE-END>  now oer the one halfworld
    nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
    the curtaind sleep witchcraft celebrates
    pale hecates offerings and witherd murther
    alarumd by his sentinel the wolf
    whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace
    with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design
    moves like a ghost <SENTENCE-END>  thou sure and firmset earth
    hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
    thy very stones prate of my whereabout
    and take the present horror from the time
    which now suits with it <SENTENCE-END>  whiles i threat he lives
    words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives <SENTENCE-END>

  old man <SENTENCE-END>  threescore and ten i can remember well
    within the volume of which time i have seen
    hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
    hath trifled former knowings <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  ah good father
    thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act
    threaten his bloody stage <SENTENCE-END>  by the clock tis day
    and yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp <SENTENCE-END> 
    ist nights predominance or the days shame
    that darkness does the face of earth entomb
    when living light should kiss it
  old man <SENTENCE-END>  tis unnatural
    even like the deed thats done <SENTENCE-END>  on tuesday last
    a falcon towering in her pride of place
    was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killd <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  and duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain
    beauteous and swift the minions of their race  
    turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
    contending gainst obedience as they would make
    war with mankind <SENTENCE-END> 
  old man <SENTENCE-END>  tis said they eat each other <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  they did so to the amazement of mine eyes
    that lookd upont <SENTENCE-END>

  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  they were subornd
    malcolm and donalbain the kings two sons
    are stoln away and fled which puts upon them
    suspicion of the deed <SENTENCE-END>   
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  gainst nature still
    thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
    thine own lifes means then tis most like
    the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  he is already named and gone to scone
    to be invested <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  where is duncans body
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  carried to colmekill
    the sacred storehouse of his predecessors
    and guardian of their bones <SENTENCE-END>

    whose being i do fear and under him
    my genius is rebuked as it is said
    mark antonys was by caesar <SENTENCE-END>  he chid the sisters
    when first they put the name of king upon me
    and bade them speak to him then prophetlike
    they haild him father to a line of kings <SENTENCE-END> 
    upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
    and put a barren sceptre in my gripe
    thence to be wrenchd with an unlineal hand
    no son of mine succeeding <SENTENCE-END>  ift be so
    for banquos issue have i filed my mind
    for them the gracious duncan have i murtherd
    put rancors in the vessel of my peace
    only for them and mine eternal jewel  
    given to the common enemy of man
    to make them kings the seed of banquo kings
    rather than so come fate into the list
    and champion me to the utterance whos there

        reenter attendant with two murtherers <SENTENCE-END> 

    now go to the door and stay there till we call <SENTENCE-END>

    that it was he in the times past which held you
    so under fortune which you thought had been
    our innocent self this i made good to you
    in our last conference passd in probation with you
    how you were borne in hand how crossd the instruments
    who wrought with them and all things else that might
    to half a soul and to a notion crazed  
    say thus did banquo <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murtherer <SENTENCE-END>  you made it known to us <SENTENCE-END> 
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  i did so and went further which is now
    our point of second meeting <SENTENCE-END>  do you find
    your patience so predominant in your nature
    that you can let this go are you so gospeld
    to pray for this good man and for his issue
    whose heavy hand hath bowd you to the grave
    and beggard yours forever
  first murtherer <SENTENCE-END>  we are men my liege <SENTENCE-END> 
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  ay in the catalogue ye go for men
    as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
    shoughs waterrugs and demiwolves are clept
    all by the name of dogs <SENTENCE-END>  the valued file
    distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
    the housekeeper the hunter every one
    according to the gift which bounteous nature
    hath in him closed whereby he does receive
    particular addition from the bill
    that writes them all alike and so of men <SENTENCE-END>   
    now if you have a station in the file
    not i the worst rank of manhood say it
    and i will put that business in your bosoms
    whose execution takes your enemy off
    grapples you to the heart and love of us
    who wear our health but sickly in his life
    which in his death were perfect <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murtherer <SENTENCE-END>  i am one my liege
    whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    have so incensed that i am reckless what
    i do to spite the world <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murtherer <SENTENCE-END>  and i another
    so weary with disasters tuggd with fortune
    that i would set my life on any chance
    to mend it or be rid ont <SENTENCE-END>

    know banquo was your enemy <SENTENCE-END> 
  both murtherers <SENTENCE-END>  true my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  so is he mine and in such bloody distance
    that every minute of his being thrusts  
    against my nearst of life and though i could
    with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    and bid my will avouch it yet i must not
    for certain friends that are both his and mine
    whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall
    who i myself struck down <SENTENCE-END>  and thence it is
    that i to your assistance do make love
    masking the business from the common eye
    for sundry weighty reasons <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murtherer <SENTENCE-END>  we shall my lord
    perform what you command us <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murtherer <SENTENCE-END>  though our lives
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  your spirits shine through you <SENTENCE-END>  within this hour at most
    i will advise you where to plant yourselves
    acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
    the moment ont fort must be done tonight
    and something from the palace always thought
    that i require a clearness and with him
    to leave no rubs nor botches in the work
    fleance his son that keeps him company  
    whose absence is no less material to me
    than is his fathers must embrace the fate
    of that dark hour <SENTENCE-END>  resolve yourselves apart
    ill come to you anon <SENTENCE-END> 
  both murtherers <SENTENCE-END>  we are resolved my lord <SENTENCE-END>

    how now my lord why do you keep alone

    shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice
    remains in danger of her former tooth <SENTENCE-END> 
    but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer
    ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
    in the affliction of these terrible dreams
    that shake us nightly <SENTENCE-END>  better be with the dead
    whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
    than on the torture of the mind to lie
    in restless ecstasy <SENTENCE-END>  duncan is in his grave
    after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well <SENTENCE-END> 
    treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
    malice domestic foreign levy nothing

    let your remembrance apply to banquo
    present him eminence both with eye and tongue  
    unsafe the while that we
    must lave our honors in these flattering streams
    and make our faces vizards to our hearts
    disguising what they are <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  you must leave this <SENTENCE-END> 
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife

    then be thou jocund <SENTENCE-END>  ere the bat hath flown
    his cloisterd flight ere to black hecates summons
    the shardborne beetle with his drowsy hums
    hath rung nights yawning peal there shall be done
    a deed of dreadful note <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  whats to be done
  macbeth <SENTENCE-END>  be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
    till thou applaud the deed <SENTENCE-END>  come seeling night
    scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
    and with thy bloody and invisible hand
    cancel and tear to pieces that great bond  
    which keeps me pale light thickens and the crow
    makes wing to the rooky wood
    good things of day begin to droop and drowse
    whiles nights black agents to their preys do rouse <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou marvelst at my words but hold thee still
    things bad begun make strong themselves by ill <SENTENCE-END> 
    so prithee go with me <SENTENCE-END>                              exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

    who cannot want the thought how monstrous
    it was for malcolm and for donalbain
    to kill their gracious father damned fact
    how it did grieve macbeth did he not straight
    in pious rage the two delinquents tear
    that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
    was not that nobly done ay and wisely too
    for twould have angerd any heart alive
    to hear the men denyt <SENTENCE-END>  so that i say
    he has borne all things well and i do think  
    that had he duncans sons under his key
    as ant please heaven he shall not they should find
    what twere to kill a father so should fleance <SENTENCE-END> 
    but peace for from broad words and cause he faild

    from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth

    of the most pious edward with such grace
    that the malevolence of fortune nothing
    takes from his high respect <SENTENCE-END>  thither macduff
    is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
    to wake northumberland and warlike siward
    that by the help of these with him above
    to ratify the work we may again
    give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
    free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
    do faithful homage and receive free honors  
    all which we pine for now <SENTENCE-END>  and this report
    hath so exasperate the king that he
    prepares for some attempt of war <SENTENCE-END> 
  lennox <SENTENCE-END>  sent he to macduff
  lord <SENTENCE-END>  he did and with an absolute sir not i
    the cloudy messenger turns me his back
    and hums as who should say youll rue the time
    that clogs me with this answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  lennox <SENTENCE-END>  and that well might
    advise him to a caution to hold what distance
    his wisdom can provide <SENTENCE-END>  some holy angel
    fly to the court of england and unfold
    his message ere he come that a swift blessing
    may soon return to this our suffering country
    under a hand accursed
  lord <SENTENCE-END>  ill send my prayers with him <SENTENCE-END>

  ross <SENTENCE-END>  you must have patience madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady macduff <SENTENCE-END>  he had none
    his flight was madness <SENTENCE-END>  when our actions do not
    our fears do make us traitors <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  you know not
    whether it was his wisdom or his fear <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady macduff <SENTENCE-END>  wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes
    his mansion and his titles in a place
    from whence himself does fly he loves us not
    he wants the natural touch for the poor wren
    the most diminutive of birds will fight
    her young ones in her nest against the owl <SENTENCE-END> 
    all is the fear and nothing is the love
    as little is the wisdom where the flight
    so runs against all reason <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  my dearest coz  
    i pray you school yourself <SENTENCE-END>  but for your husband
    he is noble wise judicious and best knows
    the fits o the season <SENTENCE-END>  i dare not speak much further
    but cruel are the times when we are traitors
    and do not know ourselves when we hold rumor
    from what we fear yet know not what we fear
    but float upon a wild and violent sea
    each way and move <SENTENCE-END>  i take my leave of you
    shall not be long but ill be here again <SENTENCE-END> 
    things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
    to what they were before <SENTENCE-END>  my pretty cousin

scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
england <SENTENCE-END>  before the kings palace <SENTENCE-END> 

enter malcolm and macduff <SENTENCE-END> 

  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  let us seek out some desolate shade and there
    weep our sad bosoms empty <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  let us rather
    hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
    bestride our downfalln birthdom <SENTENCE-END>  each new morn
    new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
    strike heaven on the face that it resounds
    as if it felt with scotland and yelld out
    like syllable of dolor <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  what i believe ill wall
    what know believe and what i can redress
    as i shall find the time to friend i will <SENTENCE-END> 
    what you have spoke it may be so perchance <SENTENCE-END> 
    this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
    was once thought honest <SENTENCE-END>  you have loved him well
    he hath not touchd you yet <SENTENCE-END>  i am young but something
    you may deserve of him through me and wisdom  
    to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
    to appease an angry god <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  i am not treacherous <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  but macbeth is <SENTENCE-END> 
    a good and virtuous nature may recoil
    in an imperial charge <SENTENCE-END>  but i shall crave your pardon
    that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose <SENTENCE-END> 
    angels are bright still though the brightest fell <SENTENCE-END> 
    though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
    yet grace must still look so <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  i have lost my hopes <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  perchance even there where i did find my doubts <SENTENCE-END> 
    why in that rawness left you wife and child
    those precious motives those strong knots of love
    without leavetaking i pray you
    let not my jealousies be your dishonors
    but mine own safeties <SENTENCE-END>  you may be rightly just
    whatever i shall think <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  bleed bleed poor country
    great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure  
    for goodness dare not check thee <SENTENCE-END>  wear thou thy wrongs
    the title is affeerd <SENTENCE-END>  fare thee well lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    i would not be the villain that thou thinkst
    for the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp
    and the rich east to boot <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  be not offended
    i speak not as in absolute fear of you <SENTENCE-END> 
    i think our country sinks beneath the yoke
    it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
    is added to her wounds <SENTENCE-END>  i think withal
    there would be hands uplifted in my right
    and here from gracious england have i offer
    of goodly thousands <SENTENCE-END>  but for all this
    when i shall tread upon the tyrants head
    or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
    shall have more vices than it had before
    more suffer and more sundry ways than ever
    by him that shall succeed <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  what should he be
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  it is myself i mean in whom i know  
    all the particulars of vice so grafted
    that when they shall be opend black macbeth
    will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
    esteem him as a lamb being compared
    with my confineless harms <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  not in the legions
    of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd
    in evils to top macbeth <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  i grant him bloody
    luxurious avaricious false deceitful
    sudden malicious smacking of every sin
    that has a name <SENTENCE-END>  but theres no bottom none
    in my voluptuousness <SENTENCE-END>  your wives your daughters
    your matrons and your maids could not fill up
    the cestern of my lust and my desire
    all continent impediments would oerbear
    that did oppose my will <SENTENCE-END>  better macbeth
    than such an one to reign <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  boundless intemperance
    in nature is a tyranny it hath been  
    the untimely emptying of the happy throne
    and fall of many kings <SENTENCE-END>  but fear not yet
    to take upon you what is yours <SENTENCE-END>  you may
    convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
    and yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink <SENTENCE-END> 
    we have willing dames enough there cannot be
    that vulture in you to devour so many
    as will to greatness dedicate themselves
    finding it so inclined <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  with this there grows
    in my most illcomposed affection such
    a stanchless avarice that were i king
    i should cut off the nobles for their lands
    desire his jewels and this others house
    and my morehaving would be as a sauce
    to make me hunger more that i should forge
    quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
    destroying them for wealth <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  this avarice
    sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root  
    than summerseeming lust and it hath been
    the sword of our slain kings <SENTENCE-END>  yet do not fear
    scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
    of your mere own <SENTENCE-END>  all these are portable
    with other graces weighd <SENTENCE-END> 
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  but i have none <SENTENCE-END>  the kingbecoming graces
    as justice verity temperance stableness
    bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
    devotion patience courage fortitude
    i have no relish of them but abound
    in the division of each several crime
    acting it many ways <SENTENCE-END>  nay had i power i should
    pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
    uproar the universal peace confound
    all unity on earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  o scotland scotland
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  if such a one be fit to govern speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am as i have spoken <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  fit to govern
    no not to live <SENTENCE-END>  o nation miserable  
    with an untitled tyrant bloodyscepterd
    when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
    since that the truest issue of thy throne
    by his own interdiction stands accursed
    and does blaspheme his breed thy royal father
    was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
    oftener upon her knees than on her feet
    died every day she lived <SENTENCE-END>  fare thee well
    these evils thou repeatst upon thyself
    have banishd me from scotland <SENTENCE-END>  o my breast
    thy hope ends here
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  macduff this noble passion
    child of integrity hath from my soul
    wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
    to thy good truth and honor <SENTENCE-END>  devilish macbeth
    by many of these trains hath sought to win me
    into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
    from overcredulous haste <SENTENCE-END>  but god above
    deal between thee and me for even now
    i put myself to thy direction and  
    unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
    the taints and blames i laid upon myself
    for strangers to my nature <SENTENCE-END>  i am yet
    unknown to woman never was forsworn
    scarcely have coveted what was mine own
    at no time broke my faith would not betray
    the devil to his fellow and delight
    no less in truth than life <SENTENCE-END>  my first false speaking
    was this upon myself <SENTENCE-END>  what i am truly
    is thine and my poor countrys to command <SENTENCE-END> 
    whither indeed before thy hereapproach
    old siward with ten thousand warlike men
    already at a point was setting forth <SENTENCE-END> 
    now well together and the chance of goodness
    be like our warranted quarrel why are you silent
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  such welcome and unwelcome things at once

    which often since my hereremain in england
    i have seen him do <SENTENCE-END>  how he solicits heaven
    himself best knows but strangelyvisited people
    all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
    the mere despair of surgery he cures
    hanging a golden stamp about their necks
    put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
    to the succeeding royalty he leaves
    the healing benediction <SENTENCE-END>  with this strange virtue
    he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy  
    and sundry blessings hang about his throne
    that speak him full of grace <SENTENCE-END>

    almost afraid to know itself it cannot
    be calld our mother but our grave <SENTENCE-END>  where nothing
    but who knows nothing is once seen to smile
    where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
    are made not markd where violent sorrow seems
    a modern ecstasy <SENTENCE-END>  the dead mans knell
    is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives  
    expire before the flowers in their caps
    dying or ere they sicken <SENTENCE-END>

  ross <SENTENCE-END>  when i came hither to transport the tidings
    which i have heavily borne there ran a rumor
    of many worthy fellows that were out
    which was to my belief witnessd the rather

    where hearing should not latch them <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  what concern they
    the general cause or is it a feegrief
    due to some single breast
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  no mind thats honest
    but in it shares some woe though the main part
    pertains to you alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  if it be mine

  macduff <SENTENCE-END>  i shall do so
    but i must also feel it as a man <SENTENCE-END> 
    i cannot but remember such things were
    that were most precious to me <SENTENCE-END>  did heaven look on
    and would not take their part sinful macduff
    they were all struck for thee naught that i am
    not for their own demerits but for mine
    fell slaughter on their souls <SENTENCE-END>  heaven rest them now
  malcolm <SENTENCE-END>  be this the whetstone of your sword <SENTENCE-END>  let grief
    convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it <SENTENCE-END>

    bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself
    within my swords length set him if he scape  
    heaven forgive him too

    come go we to the king our power is ready
    our lack is nothing but our leave <SENTENCE-END>  macbeth
    is ripe for shaking and the powers above
    put on their instruments <SENTENCE-END>  receive what cheer you may

  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  of government the properties to unfold
    would seem in me t affect speech and discourse
    since i am put to know that your own science
    exceeds in that the lists of all advice
    my strength can give you then no more remains
    but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able
    and let them work <SENTENCE-END>  the nature of our people
    our citys institutions and the terms
    for common justice yare as pregnant in
    as art and practice hath enriched any
    that we remember <SENTENCE-END>  there is our commission
    from which we would not have you warp <SENTENCE-END>  call hither
    i say bid come before us angelo <SENTENCE-END>          exit an attendant
    what figure of us think you he will bear
    for you must know we have with special soul  
    elected him our absence to supply
    lent him our terror dressd him with our love
    and given his deputation all the organs
    of our own power <SENTENCE-END>  what think you of it
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  if any in vienna be of worth
    to undergo such ample grace and honour
    it is lord angelo <SENTENCE-END>

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  angelo
    there is a kind of character in thy life
    that to th observer doth thy history
    fully unfold <SENTENCE-END>  thyself and thy belongings
    are not thine own so proper as to waste
    thyself upon thy virtues they on thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    heaven doth with us as we with torches do  
    not light them for themselves for if our virtues
    did not go forth of us twere all alike
    as if we had them not <SENTENCE-END>  spirits are not finely touchd
    but to fine issues nor nature never lends
    the smallest scruple of her excellence
    but like a thrifty goddess she determines
    herself the glory of a creditor
    both thanks and use <SENTENCE-END>  but i do bend my speech
    to one that can my part in him advertise <SENTENCE-END> 
    hold therefore angelo
    in our remove be thou at full ourself
    mortality and mercy in vienna
    live in thy tongue and heart <SENTENCE-END>  old escalus
    though first in question is thy secondary <SENTENCE-END> 
    take thy commission <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  now good my lord
    let there be some more test made of my metal
    before so noble and so great a figure
    be stampd upon it <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  no more evasion  
    we have with a leavend and prepared choice
    proceeded to you therefore take your honours <SENTENCE-END> 
    our haste from hence is of so quick condition
    that it prefers itself and leaves unquestiond
    matters of needful value <SENTENCE-END>  we shall write to you

  mrs <SENTENCE-END>  overdone <SENTENCE-END>  whats to do here thomas tapster lets withdraw <SENTENCE-END> 
  pompey <SENTENCE-END>  here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison
    and theres madam juliet <SENTENCE-END>                              exeunt

            enter provost claudio juliet and officers
                            lucio following

  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  fellow why dost thou show me thus to th world
    bear me to prison where i am committed <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  i do it not in evil disposition
    but from lord angelo by special charge <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  thus can the demigod authority
    make us pay down for our offence by weight
    the words of heaven on whom it will it will
    on whom it will not so yet still tis just <SENTENCE-END>   
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  why how now claudio whence comes this restraint
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  from too much liberty my lucio liberty
    as surfeit is the father of much fast
    so every scope by the immoderate use
    turns to restraint <SENTENCE-END>  our natures do pursue
    like rats that ravin down their proper bane
    a thirsty evil and when we drink we die <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  if i could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for
    certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief
    have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment <SENTENCE-END> 
    whats thy offence claudio
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  what but to speak of would offend again <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  what ist murder
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  lechery
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  call it so <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  away sir you must go <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  one word good friend <SENTENCE-END>  lucio a word with you <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  a hundred if theyll do you any good <SENTENCE-END>  is lechery so lookd
    after  
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  thus stands it with me upon a true contract
    i got possession of juliettas bed <SENTENCE-END> 
    you know the lady she is fast my wife
    save that we do the denunciation lack
    of outward order this we came not to
    only for propagation of a dowr
    remaining in the coffer of her friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
    till time had made them for us <SENTENCE-END>  but it chances
    the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
    with character too gross is writ on juliet <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  with child perhaps
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  unhappily even so <SENTENCE-END> 
    and the new deputy now for the duke
    whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
    or whether that the body public be
    a horse whereon the governor doth ride
    who newly in the seat that it may know
    he can command lets it straight feel the spur
    whether the tyranny be in his place  
    or in his eminence that fills it up
    i stagger in <SENTENCE-END>  but this new governor
    awakes me all the enrolled penalties
    which have like unscourd armour hung by th wall
    so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
    and none of them been worn and for a name
    now puts the drowsy and neglected act
    freshly on me <SENTENCE-END>  tis surely for a name <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy
    shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off <SENTENCE-END> 
    send after the duke and appeal to him <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  i have done so but hes not to be found <SENTENCE-END> 
    i prithee lucio do me this kind service
    this day my sister should the cloister enter
    and there receive her approbation
    acquaint her with the danger of my state
    implore her in my voice that she make friends
    to the strict deputy bid herself assay him <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have great hope in that for in her youth
    there is a prone and speechless dialect  
    such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
    when she will play with reason and discourse
    and well she can persuade <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like
    which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the
    enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus
    foolishly lost at a game of ticktack <SENTENCE-END>  ill to her <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  i thank you good friend lucio <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  within two hours <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  come officer away <SENTENCE-END>                            exeunt




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
a monastery

enter duke and friar thomas

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  no holy father throw away that thought
    believe not that the dribbling dart of love
    can pierce a complete bosom <SENTENCE-END>  why i desire thee
    to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
    more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
    of burning youth <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  may your grace speak of it
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  my holy sir none better knows than you
    how i have ever lovd the life removed
    and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
    where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have deliverd to lord angelo
    a man of stricture and firm abstinence
    my absolute power and place here in vienna
    and he supposes me travelld to poland
    for so i have strewd it in the common ear
    and so it is received <SENTENCE-END>  now pious sir  
    you will demand of me why i do this <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  gladly my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  we have strict statutes and most biting laws
    the needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds
    which for this fourteen years we have let slip
    even like an oergrown lion in a cave
    that goes not out to prey <SENTENCE-END>  now as fond fathers
    having bound up the threatning twigs of birch
    only to stick it in their childrens sight
    for terror not to use in time the rod
    becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees
    dead to infliction to themselves are dead
    and liberty plucks justice by the nose
    the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
    goes all decorum <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  it rested in your grace
    to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleasd
    and it in you more dreadful would have seemd
    than in lord angelo <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i do fear too dreadful <SENTENCE-END>   
    sith twas my fault to give the people scope
    twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
    for what i bid them do for we bid this be done
    when evil deeds have their permissive pass
    and not the punishment <SENTENCE-END>  therefore indeed my father
    i have on angelo imposd the office
    who may in th ambush of my name strike home
    and yet my nature never in the fight
    to do in slander <SENTENCE-END>  and to behold his sway
    i will as twere a brother of your order
    visit both prince and people <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i prithee
    supply me with the habit and instruct me
    how i may formally in person bear me
    like a true friar <SENTENCE-END>  moe reasons for this action
    at our more leisure shall i render you <SENTENCE-END> 
    only this one lord angelo is precise
    stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
    that his blood flows or that his appetite
    is more to bread than stone <SENTENCE-END>  hence shall we see
    if power change purpose what our seemers be <SENTENCE-END>          exeunt




scene iv <SENTENCE-END> 
a nunnery

enter isabella and francisca

  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  and have you nuns no farther privileges
  francisca <SENTENCE-END>  are not these large enough
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  yes truly i speak not as desiring more
    but rather wishing a more strict restraint
    upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>   within ho peace be in this place
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  whos that which calls
  francisca <SENTENCE-END>  it is a mans voice <SENTENCE-END>  gentle isabella
    turn you the key and know his business of him
    you may i may not you are yet unsworn
    when you have vowd you must not speak with men
    but in the presence of the prioress
    then if you speak you must not show your face
    or if you show your face you must not speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    he calls again i pray you answer him <SENTENCE-END>         exit francisca
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  peace and prosperity who ist that calls
  
                           enter lucio

  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
    proclaim you are no less <SENTENCE-END>  can you so stead me
    as bring me to the sight of isabella
    a novice of this place and the fair sister
    to her unhappy brother claudio
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  why her unhappy brother let me ask
    the rather for i now must make you know
    i am that isabella and his sister <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you <SENTENCE-END> 
    not to be weary with you hes in prison <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  woe me for what
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  for that which if myself might be his judge
    he should receive his punishment in thanks
    he hath got his friend with child <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  sir make me not your story <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  it is true <SENTENCE-END> 
    i would not though tis my familiar sin
    with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest  
    tongue far from heart play with all virgins so
    i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted
    by your renouncement an immortal spirit
    and to be talkd with in sincerity
    as with a saint <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  you do blaspheme the good in mocking me <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  do not believe it <SENTENCE-END>  fewness and truth tis thus
    your brother and his lover have embracd <SENTENCE-END> 
    as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
    that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
    to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
    expresseth his full tilth and husbandry <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  some one with child by him my cousin juliet
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  is she your cousin
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
    by vain though apt affection <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  she it is <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o let him marry her
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  this is the point <SENTENCE-END> 
    the duke is very strangely gone from hence  
    bore many gentlemen myself being one
    in hand and hope of action but we do learn
    by those that know the very nerves of state
    his givingsout were of an infinite distance
    from his truemeant design <SENTENCE-END>  upon his place
    and with full line of his authority
    governs lord angelo a man whose blood
    is very snowbroth one who never feels
    the wanton stings and motions of the sense
    but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
    with profits of the mind study and fast <SENTENCE-END> 
    he to give fear to use and liberty
    which have for long run by the hideous law
    as mice by lions hath pickd out an act
    under whose heavy sense your brothers life
    falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
    and follows close the rigour of the statute
    to make him an example <SENTENCE-END>  all hope is gone
    unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
    to soften angelo <SENTENCE-END>  and thats my pith of business  
    twixt you and your poor brother <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  doth he so seek his life
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  has censurd him
    already and as i hear the provost hath
    a warrant for his execution <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  alas what poor abilitys in me
    to do him good
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  assay the powr you have <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  my power alas i doubt
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  our doubts are traitors
    and make us lose the good we oft might win
    by fearing to attempt <SENTENCE-END>  go to lord angelo
    and let him learn to know when maidens sue
    men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
    all their petitions are as freely theirs
    as they themselves would owe them <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  ill see what i can do <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  but speedily <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i will about it straight
    no longer staying but to give the mother  
    notice of my affair <SENTENCE-END>  i humbly thank you <SENTENCE-END> 
    commend me to my brother soon at night
    ill send him certain word of my success <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  i take my leave of you <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  good sir adieu <SENTENCE-END>                               exeunt

act ii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
a hall in angelos house

enter angelo escalus a justice provost officers and other attendants

  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  we must not make a scarecrow of the law
    setting it up to fear the birds of prey
    and let it keep one shape till custom make it
    their perch and not their terror <SENTENCE-END> 
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  ay but yet
    let us be keen and rather cut a little
    than fall and bruise to death <SENTENCE-END>  alas this gentleman
    whom i would save had a most noble father <SENTENCE-END> 
    let but your honour know
    whom i believe to be most strait in virtue
    that in the working of your own affections
    had time coherd with place or place with wishing
    or that the resolute acting of our blood
    could have attaind th effect of your own purpose
    whether you had not sometime in your life
    errd in this point which now you censure him  
    and pulld the law upon you <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  tis one thing to be tempted escalus
    another thing to fall <SENTENCE-END>  i not deny
    the jury passing on the prisoners life
    may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
    guiltier than him they try <SENTENCE-END>  whats open made to justice
    that justice seizes <SENTENCE-END>  what knows the laws
    that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant
    the jewel that we find we stoop and taket
    because we see it but what we do not see
    we tread upon and never think of it <SENTENCE-END> 
    you may not so extenuate his offence
    for i have had such faults but rather tell me
    when i that censure him do so offend
    let mine own judgment pattern out my death
    and nothing come in partial <SENTENCE-END>  sir he must die <SENTENCE-END> 
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  be it as your wisdom will <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  where is the provost
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  here if it like your honour <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  see that claudio  
    be executed by nine tomorrow morning
    bring him his confessor let him be prepard
    for thats the utmost of his pilgrimage <SENTENCE-END>         exit provost
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  aside well heaven forgive him and forgive us all
    some rise by sin and some by virtue fall
    some run from breaks of ice and answer none
    and some condemned for a fault alone <SENTENCE-END> 

         enter elbow and officers with froth and pompey

  elbow <SENTENCE-END>  come bring them away if these be good people in a
    commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses

    not the kings crown nor the deputed sword
    the marshals truncheon nor the judges robe

    if he had been as you and you as he

  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella ay touch him theres the vein <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  your brother is a forfeit of the law
    and you but waste your words <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  alas alas
    why all the souls that were were forfeit once
    and he that might the vantage best have took
    found out the remedy <SENTENCE-END>  how would you be
    if he which is the top of judgment should
    but judge you as you are o think on that
    and mercy then will breathe within your lips
    like man new made <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  be you content fair maid <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is the law not i condemn your brother <SENTENCE-END> 
    were he my kinsman brother or my son
    it should be thus with him <SENTENCE-END>  he must die tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  tomorrow o thats sudden spare him spare him <SENTENCE-END> 
    hes not prepard for death <SENTENCE-END>  even for our kitchens
    we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
    with less respect than we do minister
    to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you <SENTENCE-END>   
    who is it that hath died for this offence
    theres many have committed it <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  aside ay well said <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  the law hath not been dead though it hath slept <SENTENCE-END> 
    those many had not dard to do that evil
    if the first that did th edict infringe
    had answerd for his deed <SENTENCE-END>  now tis awake
    takes note of what is done and like a prophet
    looks in a glass that shows what future evils
    either now or by remissness new conceivd
    and so in progress to be hatchd and born
    are now to have no successive degrees
    but here they live to end <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  yet show some pity <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  i show it most of all when i show justice
    for then i pity those i do not know
    which a dismissd offence would after gall
    and do him right that answering one foul wrong
    lives not to act another <SENTENCE-END>  be satisfied
    your brother dies tomorrow be content <SENTENCE-END>   
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  so you must be the first that gives this sentence
    and he that suffers <SENTENCE-END>  o it is excellent
    to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous
    to use it like a giant <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella thats well said <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  could great men thunder
    as jove himself does jove would never be quiet
    for every pelting petty officer
    would use his heaven for thunder
    nothing but thunder <SENTENCE-END>  merciful heaven
    thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
    splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
    than the soft myrtle <SENTENCE-END>  but man proud man
    dressd in a little brief authority
    most ignorant of what hes most assurd
    his glassy essence like an angry ape
    plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
    as makes the angels weep who with our speens
    would all themselves laugh mortal <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella o to him to him wench he will relent  
    hes coming i perceive t <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  aside pray heaven she win him <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  we cannot weigh our brother with ourself <SENTENCE-END> 
    great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
    but in the less foul profanation <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella thourt i th right girl more o that <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  that in the captains but a choleric word
    which in the soldier is flat blasphemy <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella art avisd o that more ont <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  why do you put these sayings upon me
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  because authority though it err like others
    hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
    that skins the vice o th top <SENTENCE-END>  go to your bosom
    knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
    thats like my brothers fault <SENTENCE-END>  if it confess
    a natural guiltiness such as is his
    let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
    against my brothers life <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  aside she speaks and tis
    such sense that my sense breeds with it <SENTENCE-END>  fare you well <SENTENCE-END>   
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  gentle my lord turn back <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  i will bethink me <SENTENCE-END>  come again tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  hark how ill bribe you good my lord turn back <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  how bribe me
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella you had marrd all else <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  not with fond sicles of the tested gold
    or stones whose rate are either rich or poor
    as fancy values them but with true prayers
    that shall be up at heaven and enter there
    ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
    from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
    to nothing temporal <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  well come to me tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  to isabella go to tis well away <SENTENCE-END>

  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  save your honour              exeunt all but angelo
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  from thee even from thy virtue
    whats this whats this is this her fault or mine
    the tempter or the tempted who sins most
    ha
    not she nor doth she tempt but it is i
    that lying by the violet in the sun
    do as the carrion does not as the flowr
    corrupt with virtuous season <SENTENCE-END>  can it be
    that modesty may more betray our sense
    than womans lightness having waste ground enough
    shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
    and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
    what dost thou or what art thou angelo
    dost thou desire her foully for those things
    that make her good o let her brother live
    thieves for their robbery have authority
    when judges steal themselves <SENTENCE-END>  what do i love her  
    that i desire to hear her speak again
    and feast upon her eyes what ist i dream on
    o cunning enemy that to catch a saint
    with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
    is that temptation that doth goad us on
    to sin in loving virtue <SENTENCE-END>  never could the strumpet
    with all her double vigour art and nature
    once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
    subdues me quite <SENTENCE-END>  ever till now
    when men were fond i smild and wondred how <SENTENCE-END>           exit

scene iv <SENTENCE-END> 
angelos house

enter angelo

  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  when i would pray and think i think and pray
    to several subjects <SENTENCE-END>  heaven hath my empty words
    whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
    anchors on isabel <SENTENCE-END>  heaven in my mouth
    as if i did but only chew his name
    and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    of my conception <SENTENCE-END>  the state whereon i studied
    is like a good thing being often read
    grown sere and tedious yea my gravity
    wherein let no man hear me i take pride
    could i with boot change for an idle plume
    which the air beats for vain <SENTENCE-END>  o place o form
    how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
    wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
    to thy false seeming blood thou art blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    lets write good angel on the devils horn
    tis not the devils crest <SENTENCE-END>   

                           enter servant

    how now whos there
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  one isabel a sister desires access to you <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  teach her the way <SENTENCE-END>  exit servant o heavens
    why does my blood thus muster to my heart
    making both it unable for itself
    and dispossessing all my other parts
    of necessary fitness
    so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
    come all to help him and so stop the air
    by which he should revive and even so
    the general subject to a wellwishd king
    quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
    crowd to his presence where their untaught love
    must needs appear offence <SENTENCE-END> 

                            enter isabella
  
    how now fair maid
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i am come to know your pleasure <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  that you might know it would much better please me
    than to demand what tis <SENTENCE-END>  your brother cannot live <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  even so heaven keep your honour
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  yet may he live awhile and it may be
    as long as you or i yet he must die <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  under your sentence
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  yea <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  when i beseech you that in his reprieve
    longer or shorter he may be so fitted
    that his soul sicken not <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  ha fie these filthy vices it were as good
    to pardon him that hath from nature stoln
    a man already made as to remit
    their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image
    in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy
    falsely to take away a life true made
    as to put metal in restrained means
    to make a false one <SENTENCE-END>   
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  tis set down so in heaven but not in earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  say you so then i shall pose you quickly <SENTENCE-END> 
    which had you rather that the most just law
    now took your brothers life or to redeem him
    give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
    as she that he hath staind
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  sir believe this
    i had rather give my body than my soul <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  i talk not of your soul our compelld sins
    stand more for number than for accompt <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  how say you
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  nay ill not warrant that for i can speak
    against the thing i say <SENTENCE-END>  answer to this
    i now the voice of the recorded law
    pronounce a sentence on your brothers life
    might there not be a charity in sin
    to save this brothers life
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  please you to dot
    ill take it as a peril to my soul
    it is no sin at all but charity <SENTENCE-END>   
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  pleasd you to dot at peril of your soul
    were equal poise of sin and charity <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  that i do beg his life if it be sin
    heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
    if that be sin ill make it my morn prayer
    to have it added to the faults of mine
    and nothing of your answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  nay but hear me
    your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
    or seem so craftily and thats not good <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  let me be ignorant and in nothing good
    but graciously to know i am no better <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
    when it doth tax itself as these black masks
    proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
    than beauty could displayd <SENTENCE-END>  but mark me
    to be received plain ill speak more gross
    your brother is to die <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  so <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  and his offence is so as it appears  
    accountant to the law upon that pain <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  true <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  admit no other way to save his life
    as i subscribe not that nor any other
    but in the loss of question that you his sister
    finding yourself desird of such a person
    whose credit with the judge or own great place
    could fetch your brother from the manacles
    of the allbinding law and that there were
    no earthly mean to save him but that either
    you must lay down the treasures of your body
    to this supposed or else to let him suffer
    what would you do
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  as much for my poor brother as myself
    that is were i under the terms of death
    th impression of keen whips id wear as rubies
    and strip myself to death as to a bed
    that longing have been sick for ere id yield
    my body up to shame <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  then must your brother die <SENTENCE-END>   
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  and twere the cheaper way
    better it were a brother died at once
    than that a sister by redeeming him
    should die for ever <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  were not you then as cruel as the sentence
    that you have slanderd so
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  ignominy in ransom and free pardon
    are of two houses lawful mercy
    is nothing kin to foul redemption <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  you seemd of late to make the law a tyrant
    and rather provd the sliding of your brother
    a merriment than a vice <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o pardon me my lord it oft falls out
    to have what we would have we speak not what we mean
    i something do excuse the thing i hate
    for his advantage that i dearly love <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  we are all frail <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  else let my brother die
    if not a fedary but only he
    owe and succeed thy weakness <SENTENCE-END>   
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  nay women are frail too <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  ay as the glasses where they view themselves
    which are as easy broke as they make forms <SENTENCE-END> 
    women help heaven men their creation mar
    in profiting by them <SENTENCE-END>  nay call us ten times frail
    for we are soft as our complexions are
    and credulous to false prints <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  i think it well
    and from this testimony of your own sex
    since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
    than faults may shake our frames let me be bold <SENTENCE-END> 
    i do arrest your words <SENTENCE-END>  be that you are
    that is a woman if you be more youre none
    if you be one as you are well expressd
    by all external warrants show it now
    by putting on the destind livery <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i have no tongue but one gentle my lord
    let me intreat you speak the former language <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  plainly conceive i love you <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  my brother did love juliet  
    and you tell me that he shall die fort <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  he shall not isabel if you give me love <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i know your virtue hath a license int
    which seems a little fouler than it is
    to pluck on others <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  believe me on mine honour
    my words express my purpose <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  ha little honour to be much believd
    and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming
    i will proclaim thee angelo look fort <SENTENCE-END> 
    sign me a present pardon for my brother
    or with an outstretchd throat ill tell the world aloud
    what man thou art <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  who will believe thee isabel
    my unsoild name th austereness of my life
    my vouch against you and my place i th state
    will so your accusation overweigh
    that you shall stifle in your own report
    and smell of calumny <SENTENCE-END>  i have begun
    and now i give my sensual race the rein  
    fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
    lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
    that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
    by yielding up thy body to my will
    or else he must not only die the death
    but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
    to lingring sufferance <SENTENCE-END>  answer me tomorrow
    or by the affection that now guides me most
    ill prove a tyrant to him <SENTENCE-END>  as for you
    say what you can my false oerweighs your true <SENTENCE-END>         exit
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  to whom should i complain did i tell this
    who would believe me o perilous mouths
    that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
    either of condemnation or approof
    bidding the law make curtsy to their will
    hooking both right and wrong to th appetite
    to follow as it draws ill to my brother <SENTENCE-END> 
    though he hath falln by prompture of the blood
    yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
    that had he twenty heads to tender down  
    on twenty bloody blocks hed yield them up
    before his sister should her body stoop
    to such abhorrd pollution <SENTENCE-END> 
    then isabel live chaste and brother die
    more than our brother is our chastity <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill tell him yet of angelos request
    and fit his mind to death for his souls rest <SENTENCE-END>          exit

    for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun

    for all th accommodations that thou bearst
    are nursd by baseness <SENTENCE-END>  thou rt by no means valiant
    for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
    of a poor worm <SENTENCE-END>  thy best of rest is sleep  
    and that thou oft provokst yet grossly fearst
    thy death which is no more <SENTENCE-END>  thou art not thyself

    thou bearst thy heavy riches but a journey
    and death unloads thee <SENTENCE-END>  friend hast thou none

    do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
    for ending thee no sooner <SENTENCE-END>  thou hast nor youth nor age

    dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
    becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
    of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
    thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty  
    to make thy riches pleasant <SENTENCE-END>  whats yet in this

                        enter isabella

  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  my business is a word or two with claudio <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  and very welcome <SENTENCE-END>  look signior heres your sister <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  provost a word with you <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  as many as you please <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  bring me to hear them speak where i may be conceald <SENTENCE-END> 
                                         exeunt duke and provost  
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  now sister whats the comfort
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  why
    as all comforts are most good most good indeed <SENTENCE-END> 
    lord angelo having affairs to heaven
    intends you for his swift ambassador
    where you shall be an everlasting leiger <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore your best appointment make with speed
    tomorrow you set on <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  is there no remedy
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  none but such remedy as to save a head
    to cleave a heart in twain <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  but is there any
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  yes brother you may live
    there is a devilish mercy in the judge
    if youll implore it that will free your life
    but fetter you till death <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  perpetual durance
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  ay just perpetual durance a restraint
    though all the worlds vastidity you had
    to a determind scope <SENTENCE-END>   
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  but in what nature
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  in such a one as you consenting tot
    would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
    and leave you naked <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  let me know the point <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o i do fear thee claudio and i quake
    lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
    and six or seven winters more respect
    than a perpetual honour <SENTENCE-END>  darst thou die
    the sense of death is most in apprehension
    and the poor beetle that we tread upon
    in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
    as when a giant dies <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  why give you me this shame
    think you i can a resolution fetch
    from flowry tenderness if i must die
    i will encounter darkness as a bride
    and hug it in mine arms <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  there spake my brother there my fathers grave
    did utter forth a voice <SENTENCE-END>  yes thou must die  
    thou art too noble to conserve a life
    in base appliances <SENTENCE-END>  this outwardsainted deputy
    whose settled visage and deliberate word
    nips youth i th head and follies doth enew
    as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
    his filth within being cast he would appear
    a pond as deep as hell <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  the precise angelo
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o tis the cunning livery of hell
    the damnedst body to invest and cover
    in precise guards dost thou think claudio
    if i would yield him my virginity
    thou mightst be freed
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  o heavens it cannot be <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  yes he would givet thee from this rank offence
    so to offend him still <SENTENCE-END>  this nights the time
    that i should do what i abhor to name
    or else thou diest tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  thou shalt not dot <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o were it but my life  
    id throw it down for your deliverance
    as frankly as a pin <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  thanks dear isabel <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  be ready claudio for your death tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  yes <SENTENCE-END>  has he affections in him
    that thus can make him bite the law by th nose
    when he would force it sure it is no sin
    or of the deadly seven it is the least <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  which is the least
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  if it were damnable he being so wise
    why would he for the momentary trick
    be perdurably find o isabel
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  what says my brother
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  death is a fearful thing <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  and shamed life a hateful <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  ay but to die and go we know not where
    to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
    this sensible warm motion to become
    a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
    to bathe in fiery floods or to reside  
    in thrilling region of thickribbed ice
    to be imprisond in the viewless winds
    and blown with restless violence round about
    the pendent world or to be worse than worst
    of those that lawless and incertain thought
    imagine howling tis too horrible <SENTENCE-END> 
    the weariest and most loathed worldly life
    that age ache penury and imprisonment
    can lay on nature is a paradise
    to what we fear of death <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  alas alas
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  sweet sister let me live <SENTENCE-END> 
    what sin you do to save a brothers life
    nature dispenses with the deed so far
    that it becomes a virtue <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o you beast
    o faithless coward o dishonest wretch
    wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
    ist not a kind of incest to take life
    from thine own sisters shame what should i think  
    heaven shield my mother playd my father fair
    for such a warped slip of wilderness
    neer issud from his blood <SENTENCE-END>  take my defiance
    die perish <SENTENCE-END>  might but my bending down
    reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death
    no word to save thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  nay hear me isabel <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o fie fie fie
    thy sins not accidental but a trade <SENTENCE-END> 
    mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
    tis best that thou diest quickly <SENTENCE-END> 
  claudio <SENTENCE-END>  o hear me isabella <SENTENCE-END> 

                            reenter duke

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  vouchsafe a word young sister but one word <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  what is your will
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have
    some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is  
    likewise your own benefit <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out
    of other affairs but i will attend you awhile <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                   walks apart
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  son i have overheard what hath passd between you and your
    sister <SENTENCE-END>  angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath
    made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
    disposition of natures <SENTENCE-END>  she having the truth of honour in her
    hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
    receive <SENTENCE-END>  i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true

    resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die

    of it ever fair <SENTENCE-END>  the assault that angelo hath made to you
    fortune hath conveyd to my understanding and but that frailty
    hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo <SENTENCE-END>  how
    will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother
    die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born <SENTENCE-END>  but o how
    much is the good duke deceivd in angelo if ever he return and
    i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his
    government <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands
    he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only <SENTENCE-END>

    benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to
    your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if
    peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
    business <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do
    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  virtue is bold and goodness never fearful <SENTENCE-END>  have you not
    heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great
    soldier who miscarried at sea
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i have heard of the lady and good words went with her
    name <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by
    oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the
    contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was
    wreckd at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
    sister <SENTENCE-END>  but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman
    there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward
    her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of  
    her fortune her marriagedowry with both her combinate
    husband this wellseeming angelo <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  can this be so did angelo so leave her
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his
    comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries
    of dishonour in few bestowd her on her own lamentation which
    she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is
    washed with them but relents not <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
    the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man
    live but how out of this can she avail
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it
    not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in
    doing it <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  show me how good father <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
    first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should
    have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current
    made it more violent and unruly <SENTENCE-END>  go you to angelo answer his
    requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to  
    the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that
    your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all
    shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience <SENTENCE-END> 
    this being granted in course and now follows all we shall
    advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your
    place <SENTENCE-END>  if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may
    compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother

    the corrupt deputy scaled <SENTENCE-END>  the maid will i frame and make fit for
    his attempt <SENTENCE-END>  if you think well to carry this as you may the
    doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof <SENTENCE-END>  what
    think you of it
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  the image of it gives me content already and i trust it
    will grow to a most prosperous perfection <SENTENCE-END>

    angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him

    place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be
    quickly <SENTENCE-END>

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i know none <SENTENCE-END>  can you tell me of any
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  some say he is with the emperor of russia other some he is
    in rome but where is he think you
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
    state and usurp the beggary he was never born to <SENTENCE-END>  lord angelo
    dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression tot <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  he does well int <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him
    something too crabbed that way friar <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  it is too general a vice and severity must cure it <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is
    well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till
    eating and drinking be put down <SENTENCE-END>  they say this angelo was not  
    made by man and woman after this downright way of creation <SENTENCE-END>  is it
    true think you
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  how should he be made then
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  some report a seamaid spawnd him some that he was begot
    between two stockfishes <SENTENCE-END>  but it is certain that when he makes
    water his urine is congeald ice that i know to be true <SENTENCE-END>  and he
    is a motion generative thats infallible <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  you are pleasant sir and speak apace <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion
    of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that
    is absent have done this ere he would have hangd a man for the
    getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a
    thousand <SENTENCE-END>  he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service
    and that instructed him to mercy <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was
    not inclind that way <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  o sir you are deceivd <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  tis not possible <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use
    was to put a ducat in her clackdish <SENTENCE-END>  the duke had crotchets in  
    him <SENTENCE-END>  he would be drunk too that let me inform you <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  you do him wrong surely <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  sir i was an inward of his <SENTENCE-END>  a shy fellow was the duke and
    i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  what i prithee might be the cause
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  no pardon tis a secret must be lockd within the teeth
    and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file
    of the subject held the duke to be wise <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  wise why no question but he was <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very
    stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a
    warranted need give him a better proclamation <SENTENCE-END>  let him be but
    testimonied in his own bringingsforth and he shall appear to
    the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier <SENTENCE-END>  therefore you
    speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much
    darkned in your malice <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  sir i know him and i love him <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer
    love <SENTENCE-END>   
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  come sir i know what i know <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me
    desire you to make your answer before him <SENTENCE-END>  if it be honest you
    have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call
    upon you and i pray you your name
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  sir my name is lucio well known to the duke <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  i fear you not <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me
    too unhurtful an opposite <SENTENCE-END>  but indeed i can do you little harm
    youll forswear this again <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  ill be hangd first <SENTENCE-END>  thou art deceivd in me friar <SENTENCE-END>  but no
    more of this <SENTENCE-END>  canst thou tell if claudio die tomorrow or no
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  why should he die sir
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  why for filling a bottle with a tundish <SENTENCE-END>  i would the duke
    we talk of were returnd again <SENTENCE-END>  this ungeniturd agent will
    unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in
    his houseeaves because they are lecherous <SENTENCE-END>  the duke yet would
    have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to  
    light <SENTENCE-END>  would he were returnd marry this claudio is condemned
    for untrussing <SENTENCE-END>  farewell good friar i prithee pray for me <SENTENCE-END>  the
    duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays <SENTENCE-END>  hes not
    past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar
    though she smelt brown bread and garlic <SENTENCE-END>  say that i said so <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell <SENTENCE-END>                                                exit
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  no might nor greatness in mortality
    can censure scape backwounding calumny

    to use it for my time <SENTENCE-END>  i am a brother  
    of gracious order late come from the see
    in special business from his holiness <SENTENCE-END> 
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  what news abroad i th world
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
    dissolution of it must cure it <SENTENCE-END>  novelty is only in request and
    as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
    virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing <SENTENCE-END>  there is scarce
    truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough
    to make fellowships accurst <SENTENCE-END>  much upon this riddle runs the
    wisdom of the world <SENTENCE-END>  this news is old enough yet it is every
    days news <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  one that above all other strifes contended especially to
    know himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  what pleasure was he given to
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
    anything which professd to make him rejoice a gentleman of all
    temperance <SENTENCE-END>  but leave we him to his events with a prayer they
    may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find
    claudio prepard <SENTENCE-END>  i am made to understand that you have lent him
    visitation <SENTENCE-END>   
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  he professes to have received no sinister measure from his
    judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
    justice <SENTENCE-END>  yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his
    frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good
    leisure have discredited to him and now he is resolvd to die <SENTENCE-END> 
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner
    the very debt of your calling <SENTENCE-END>  i have labourd for the poor
    gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother
    justice have i found so severe that he hath forcd me to tell him
    he is indeed justice <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it
    shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath
    sentencd himself <SENTENCE-END>

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  peace be with you            exeunt escalus and provost

         he who the sword of heaven will bear
         should be as holy as severe

         more nor less to others paying
         than by selfoffences weighing <SENTENCE-END> 
         shame to him whose cruel striking
         kills for faults of his own liking
         twice treble shame on angelo
         to weed my vice and let his grow
         o what may man within him hide
         though angel on the outward side
         how may likeness made in crimes
         make a practice on the times
         to draw with idle spiders strings
         most ponderous and substantial things
         craft against vice i must apply <SENTENCE-END> 
         with angelo tonight shall lie
         his old betrothed but despised
         so disguise shall by th disguised
         pay with falsehood false exacting
         and perform an old contracting <SENTENCE-END>                     exit

    as i take it it is almost day <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  i shall obey him <SENTENCE-END>                       exit messenger
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  aside this is his pardon purchasd by such sin
    for which the pardoner himself is in
    hence hath offence his quick celerity
    when it is borne in high authority <SENTENCE-END> 
    when vice makes mercy mercys so extended
    that for the faults love is th offender friended <SENTENCE-END> 
    now sir what news
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine
    office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks
    strangely for he hath not usd it before <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  pray you lets hear <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  reads whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let
    claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon  
    barnardine <SENTENCE-END>  for my better satisfaction let me have claudios
    head sent me by five <SENTENCE-END>  let this be duly performed with a thought
    that more depends on it than we must yet deliver <SENTENCE-END>  thus fail not
    to do your office as you will answer it at your peril <SENTENCE-END> 
    what say you to this sir
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th
    afternoon
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  a bohemian born but here nursd up and bred <SENTENCE-END> 
    one that is a prisoner nine years old <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  how came it that the absent duke had not either deliverd him
    to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his
    manner to do so <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed
    his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to
    an undoubted proof <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  it is now apparent
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  most manifest and not denied by himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  hath he borne himself penitently in prison how seems he to
    be touchd
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a  
    drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past
    present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately
    mortal <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  he wants advice <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  he will hear none <SENTENCE-END>  he hath evermore had the liberty of the
    prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many
    times a day if not many days entirely drunk <SENTENCE-END>  we have very oft
    awakd him as if to carry him to execution and showd him a
    seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  more of him anon <SENTENCE-END>  there is written in your brow provost
    honesty and constancy <SENTENCE-END>  if i read it not truly my ancient skill
    beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself
    in hazard <SENTENCE-END>  claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no
    greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentencd him <SENTENCE-END>  to
    make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four
    days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and
    a dangerous courtesy <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  pray sir in what
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  in the delaying death <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  alack how may i do it having the hour limited and an  
    express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view
    of angelo i may make my case as claudios to cross this in the
    smallest <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions
    may be your guide <SENTENCE-END>  let this barnardine be this morning executed
    and his head borne to angelo <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  o deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it <SENTENCE-END>  shave
    the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the
    penitent to be so bard before his death <SENTENCE-END>  you know the course is
    common <SENTENCE-END>  if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
    good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against
    it with my life <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me good father it is against my oath <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  to him and to his substitutes <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch
    the justice of your dealing
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  but what likelihood is in that
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  not a resemblance but a certainty <SENTENCE-END>  yet since i see you  
    fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can
    with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck
    all fears out of you <SENTENCE-END>  look you sir here is the hand and seal of
    the duke <SENTENCE-END>  you know the character i doubt not and the signet is
    not strange to you <SENTENCE-END> 
  provost <SENTENCE-END>  i know them both <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall
    anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within
    these two days he will be here <SENTENCE-END>  this is a thing that angelo knows
    not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour
    perchance of the dukes death perchance entering into some
    monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ <SENTENCE-END>  look th
    unfolding star calls up the shepherd <SENTENCE-END>  put not yourself into
    amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but
    easy when they are known <SENTENCE-END>  call your executioner and off with
    barnardines head <SENTENCE-END>  i will give him a present shrift and advise
    him for a better place <SENTENCE-END>  yet you are amazd but this shall
    absolutely resolve you <SENTENCE-END>  come away it is almost clear dawn <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                          exeunt

scene iv <SENTENCE-END> 
angelos house

enter angelo and escalus

  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  every letter he hath writ hath disvouchd other <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  in most uneven and distracted manner <SENTENCE-END>  his actions show much
    like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why
    meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  i guess not <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
    entring that if any crave redress of injustice they should
    exhibit their petitions in the street
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of
     complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which
    shall then have no power to stand against us <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  well i beseech you let it be proclaimd
    betimes i th morn ill call you at your house
    give notice to such men of sort and suit
    as are to meet him <SENTENCE-END> 
  escalus <SENTENCE-END>  i shall sir fare you well <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  good night <SENTENCE-END>                                exit escalus  
    this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
    and dull to all proceedings <SENTENCE-END>  a deflowred maid
    and by an eminent body that enforcd
    the law against it but that her tender shame
    will not proclaim against her maiden loss
    how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no
    for my authority bears a so credent bulk
    that no particular scandal once can touch
    but it confounds the breather <SENTENCE-END>  he should have livd
    save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
    might in the times to come have taen revenge
    by so receiving a dishonourd life
    with ransom of such shame <SENTENCE-END>  would yet he had livd
    alack when once our grace we have forgot
    nothing goes right we would and we would not <SENTENCE-END>          exit

provost officers and citizens

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  my very worthy cousin fairly met

  angelo escalus <SENTENCE-END>  happy return be to your royal grace
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  many and hearty thankings to you both <SENTENCE-END> 
    we have made inquiry of you and we hear
    such goodness of your justice that our soul
    cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
    forerunning more requital <SENTENCE-END> 
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  you make my bonds still greater <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it
    to lock it in the wards of covert bosom
    when it deserves with characters of brass
    a forted residence gainst the tooth of time
    and razure of oblivion <SENTENCE-END>  give me your hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    and let the subject see to make them know
    that outward courtesies would fain proclaim  
    favours that keep within <SENTENCE-END>  come escalus
    you must walk by us on our other hand
    and good supporters are you <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter friar peter and isabella

  peter <SENTENCE-END>  now is your time speak loud and kneel before him <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  justice o royal duke vail your regard
    upon a wrongd i would fain have said a maid
    o worthy prince dishonour not your eye
    by throwing it on any other object
    till you have heard me in my true complaint
    and given me justice justice justice justice <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  relate your wrongs <SENTENCE-END>  in what by whom be brief <SENTENCE-END> 
    here is lord angelo shall give you justice
    reveal yourself to him <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o worthy duke
    you bid me seek redemption of the devil
    hear me yourself for that which i must speak
    must either punish me not being believd  
    or wring redress from you <SENTENCE-END>  hear me o hear me here
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  my lord her wits i fear me are not firm
    she hath been a suitor to me for her brother
    cut off by course of justice
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  by course of justice
  angelo <SENTENCE-END>  and she will speak most bitterly and strange <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  most strange but yet most truly will i speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    that angelos forsworn is it not strange
    that angelos a murderer ist not strange
    that angelo is an adulterous thief
    an hypocrite a virginviolator
    is it not strange and strange
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  nay it is ten times strange <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  it is not truer he is angelo
    than this is all as true as it is strange
    nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
    to th end of reckning <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  away with her <SENTENCE-END>  poor soul
    she speaks this in th infirmity of sense <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o prince i conjure thee as thou believst  
    there is another comfort than this world
    that thou neglect me not with that opinion
    that i am touchd with madness <SENTENCE-END>  make not impossible
    that which but seems unlike tis not impossible
    but one the wickedst caitiff on the ground
    may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
    as angelo even so may angelo
    in all his dressings characts titles forms
    be an archvillain <SENTENCE-END>  believe it royal prince
    if he be less hes nothing but hes more
    had i more name for badness <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  by mine honesty
    if she be mad as i believe no other
    her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
    such a dependency of thing on thing
    as eer i heard in madness <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o gracious duke
    harp not on that nor do not banish reason
    for inequality but let your reason serve
    to make the truth appear where it seems hid  
    and hide the false seems true <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  many that are not mad
    have sure more lack of reason <SENTENCE-END>  what would you say
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i am the sister of one claudio
    condemnd upon the act of fornication
    to lose his head condemnd by angelo <SENTENCE-END> 
    i in probation of a sisterhood
    was sent to by my brother one lucio
    as then the messenger
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  thats i ant like your grace <SENTENCE-END> 
    i came to her from claudio and desird her
    to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
    for her poor brothers pardon <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  thats he indeed <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  you were not bid to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  no my good lord
    nor wishd to hold my peace <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i wish you now then
    pray you take note of it and when you have
    a business for yourself pray heaven you then  
    be perfect <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  i warrant your honour <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  the warrants for yourself take heed tot <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  this gentleman told somewhat of my tale <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  right <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  it may be right but you are i the wrong
    to speak before your time <SENTENCE-END>  proceed <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  i went
    to this pernicious caitiff deputy <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  thats somewhat madly spoken <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  pardon it
    the phrase is to the matter <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  mended again <SENTENCE-END>  the matter proceed <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  in brief to set the needless process by
    how i persuaded how i prayd and kneeld
    how he refelld me and how i replied
    for this was of much length the vile conclusion
    i now begin with grief and shame to utter
    he would not but by gift of my chaste body
    to his concupiscible intemperate lust  
    release my brother and after much debatement
    my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
    and i did yield to him <SENTENCE-END>  but the next morn betimes
    his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
    for my poor brothers head <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  this is most likely
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  o that it were as like as it is true
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven fond wretch thou knowst not what thou speakst
    or else thou art subornd against his honour
    in hateful practice <SENTENCE-END>  first his integrity
    stands without blemish next it imports no reason
    that with such vehemency he should pursue
    faults proper to himself <SENTENCE-END>  if he had so offended
    he would have weighd thy brother by himself
    and not have cut him off <SENTENCE-END>  some one hath set you on
    confess the truth and say by whose advice
    thou camst here to complain <SENTENCE-END> 
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  and is this all
    then o you blessed ministers above
    keep me in patience and with ripened time  
    unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
    in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe
    as i thus wrongd hence unbelieved go
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i know youd fain be gone <SENTENCE-END>  an officer
    to prison with her shall we thus permit
    a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
    on him so near us this needs must be a practice <SENTENCE-END> 
    who knew of your intent and coming hither
  isabella <SENTENCE-END>  one that i would were here friar lodowick <SENTENCE-END>

    in your retirement i had swingd him soundly <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  words against me thiss a good friar belike
    and to set on this wretched woman here
    against our substitute let this friar be found <SENTENCE-END>

    i saw them at the prison a saucy friar
    a very scurvy fellow <SENTENCE-END>

    your royal ear abusd <SENTENCE-END>  first hath this woman
    most wrongfully accusd your substitute
    who is as free from touch or soil with her
    as she from one ungot <SENTENCE-END>

    know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
  peter <SENTENCE-END>  i know him for a man divine and holy
    not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
    as hes reported by this gentleman
    and on my trust a man that never yet
    did as he vouches misreport your grace <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucio <SENTENCE-END>  my lord most villainously believe it <SENTENCE-END> 
  peter <SENTENCE-END>  well he in time may come to clear himself
    but at this instant he is sick my lord
    of a strange fever <SENTENCE-END>  upon his mere request
    being come to knowledge that there was complaint
    intended gainst lord angelo came i hither
    to speak as from his mouth what he doth know  
    is true and false and what he with his oath
    and all probation will make up full clear
    whensoever hes convented <SENTENCE-END>  first for this woman
    to justify this worthy nobleman
    so vulgarly and personally accusd
    her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
    till she herself confess it <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  good friar lets hear it <SENTENCE-END>          exit isabella guarded

    being criminal in double violation
    of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
    thereon dependent for your brothers life
    the very mercy of the law cries out
    most audible even from his proper tongue
    an angelo for claudio death for death
    haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
    like doth quit like and measure still for measure <SENTENCE-END>

    for angelo  
    his act did not oertake his bad intent

scene
venice and portias house at belmont


act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
venice <SENTENCE-END>  a street

enter antonio salerio and solanio

  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  in sooth i know not why i am so sad <SENTENCE-END> 
    it wearies me you say it wearies you
    but how i caught it found it or came by it
    what stuff tis made of whereof it is born
    i am to learn
    and such a wantwit sadness makes of me
    that i have much ado to know myself <SENTENCE-END> 
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  your mind is tossing on the ocean
    there where your argosies with portly sail
    like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
    or as it were the pageants of the sea
    do overpeer the petty traffickers
    that curtsy to them do them reverence
    as they fly by them with their woven wings <SENTENCE-END> 
  solanio <SENTENCE-END>  believe me sir had i such venture forth
    the better part of my affections would
    be with my hopes abroad <SENTENCE-END>  i should be still  
    plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
    peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
    and every object that might make me fear
    misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
    would make me sad <SENTENCE-END> 
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  my wind cooling my broth
    would blow me to an ague when i thought
    what harm a wind too great might do at sea <SENTENCE-END> 
    i should not see the sandy hourglass run
    but i should think of shallows and of flats
    and see my wealthy andrew dockd in sand
    vailing her high top lower than her ribs
    to kiss her burial <SENTENCE-END>  should i go to church
    and see the holy edifice of stone
    and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
    which touching but my gentle vessels side
    would scatter all her spices on the stream
    enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
    and in a word but even now worth this
    and now worth nothing shall i have the thought  
    to think on this and shall i lack the thought
    that such a thing bechancd would make me sad
    but tell not me i know antonio
    is sad to think upon his merchandise <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  believe me no i thank my fortune for it
    my ventures are not in one bottom trusted
    nor to one place nor is my whole estate
    upon the fortune of this present year
    therefore my merchandise makes me not sad <SENTENCE-END> 
  solanio <SENTENCE-END>  why then you are in love <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  fie fie
  solanio <SENTENCE-END>  not in love neither then let us say you are sad
    because you are not merry and twere as easy
    for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
    because you are not sad <SENTENCE-END>  now by twoheaded janus
    nature hath framd strange fellows in her time
    some that will evermore peep through their eyes
    and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
    and other of such vinegar aspect
    that theyll not show their teeth in way of smile  
    though nestor swear the jest be laughable <SENTENCE-END> 

               enter bassanio lorenzo and gratiano

    here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman
    gratiano and lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  fare ye well
    we leave you now with better company <SENTENCE-END> 
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  i would have stayd till i had made you merry
    if worthier friends had not prevented me <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  your worth is very dear in my regard <SENTENCE-END> 
    i take it your own business calls on you
    and you embrace th occasion to depart <SENTENCE-END> 
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  good morrow my good lords <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  good signiors both when shall we laugh say when <SENTENCE-END> 
    you grow exceeding strange must it be so
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  well make our leisures to attend on yours <SENTENCE-END> 
                                      exeunt salerio and solanio
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  my lord bassanio since you have found antonio
    we two will leave you but at dinnertime
    i pray you have in mind where we must meet <SENTENCE-END>   
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  i will not fail you <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  you look not well signior antonio
    you have too much respect upon the world
    they lose it that do buy it with much care <SENTENCE-END> 
    believe me you are marvellously changd <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i hold the world but as the world gratiano
    a stage where every man must play a part
    and mine a sad one <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  let me play the fool <SENTENCE-END> 
    with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
    and let my liver rather heat with wine
    than my heart cool with mortifying groans <SENTENCE-END> 
    why should a man whose blood is warm within
    sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
    sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
    by being peevish i tell thee what antonio
    i love thee and tis my love that speaks
    there are a sort of men whose visages
    do cream and mantle like a standing pond
    and do a wilful stillness entertain  
    with purpose to be dressd in an opinion
    of wisdom gravity profound conceit
    as who should say i am sir oracle
    and when i ope my lips let no dog bark <SENTENCE-END> 
    o my antonio i do know of these
    that therefore only are reputed wise
    for saying nothing when i am very sure
    if they should speak would almost damn those ears
    which hearing them would call their brothers fools <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill tell thee more of this another time <SENTENCE-END> 
    but fish not with this melancholy bait
    for this fool gudgeon this opinion <SENTENCE-END> 
    come good lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  fare ye well awhile
    ill end my exhortation after dinner <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  well we will leave you then till dinnertime <SENTENCE-END> 
    i must be one of these same dumb wise men
    for gratiano never lets me speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  well keep me company but two years moe
    thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  fare you well ill grow a talker for this gear <SENTENCE-END>   
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  thanks i faith for silence is only commendable
    in a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible <SENTENCE-END> 
                                     exeunt gratiano and lorenzo
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  is that anything now
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than
    any man in all venice <SENTENCE-END>  his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid
    in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find
    them and when you have them they are not worth the search <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  well tell me now what lady is the same
    to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
    that you today promisd to tell me of
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  tis not unknown to you antonio
    how much i have disabled mine estate
    by something showing a more swelling port
    than my faint means would grant continuance
    nor do i now make moan to be abridgd
    from such a noble rate but my chief care
    is to come fairly off from the great debts
    wherein my time something too prodigal
    hath left me gagd <SENTENCE-END>  to you antonio  
    i owe the most in money and in love
    and from your love i have a warranty
    to unburden all my plots and purposes
    how to get clear of all the debts i owe <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you good bassanio let me know it
    and if it stand as you yourself still do
    within the eye of honour be assurd
    my purse my person my extremest means
    lie all unlockd to your occasions <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft
    i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight
    the selfsame way with more advised watch
    to find the other forth and by adventuring both
    i oft found both <SENTENCE-END>  i urge this childhood proof
    because what follows is pure innocence <SENTENCE-END> 
    i owe you much and like a wilful youth
    that which i owe is lost but if you please
    to shoot another arrow that self way
    which you did shoot the first i do not doubt
    as i will watch the aim or to find both  
    or bring your latter hazard back again
    and thankfully rest debtor for the first <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  you know me well and herein spend but time
    to wind about my love with circumstance
    and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
    in making question of my uttermost
    than if you had made waste of all i have <SENTENCE-END> 
    then do but say to me what i should do
    that in your knowledge may by me be done
    and i am prest unto it therefore speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  in belmont is a lady richly left
    and she is fair and fairer than that word
    of wondrous virtues <SENTENCE-END>  sometimes from her eyes
    i did receive fair speechless messages <SENTENCE-END> 
    her name is portia nothing undervalud
    to catos daughter brutus portia <SENTENCE-END> 
    nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
    for the four winds blow in from every coast
    renowned suitors and her sunny locks
    hang on her temples like a golden fleece  
    which makes her seat of belmont colchos strond
    and many jasons come in quest of her <SENTENCE-END> 
    o my antonio had i but the means
    to hold a rival place with one of them
    i have a mind presages me such thrift
    that i should questionless be fortunate <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea

    try what my credit can in venice do
    that shall be rackd even to the uttermost
    to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia <SENTENCE-END> 
    go presently inquire and so will i
    where money is and i no question make
    to have it of my trust or for my sake <SENTENCE-END>                 exeunt





scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
belmont <SENTENCE-END>  portias house

enter portia with her waitingwoman nerissa

  portia <SENTENCE-END>  by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this
    great world <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the
    same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i
    see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
    starve with nothing <SENTENCE-END>  it is no mean happiness therefore to be
    seated in the mean superfluity come sooner by white hairs but
    competency lives longer <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  good sentences and well pronouncd <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  they would be better if well followed <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do
    chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes
    palaces <SENTENCE-END>  it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i
    can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one
    of the twenty to follow mine own teaching <SENTENCE-END>  the brain may devise
    laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree
    such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good  
    counsel the cripple <SENTENCE-END>  but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
    choose me a husband <SENTENCE-END>  o me the word choose i may neither
    choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a
    living daughter curbd by the will of a dead father <SENTENCE-END>  is it not
    hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death
    have good inspirations therefore the lottry that he hath
    devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof
    who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be
    chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love <SENTENCE-END>  but
    what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these
    princely suitors that are already come
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will
    describe them and according to my description level at my
    affection <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  first there is the neapolitan prince <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of
    his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good
    parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his
    mother playd false with a smith <SENTENCE-END>   
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  then is there the county palatine <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  he doth nothing but frown as who should say an you will
    not have me choose <SENTENCE-END>  he hears merry tales and smiles not <SENTENCE-END>  i fear
    he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so
    full of unmannerly sadness in his youth <SENTENCE-END>  i had rather be married
    to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of
    these <SENTENCE-END>  god defend me from these two
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  god made him and therefore let him pass for a man <SENTENCE-END>  in
    truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a
    horse better than the neapolitans a better bad habit of
    frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man <SENTENCE-END>  if a
    throstle sing he falls straight acapring he will fence with
    his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty
    husbands <SENTENCE-END>  if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he
    love me to madness i shall never requite him <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of
    england
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me
    nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you  
    will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth
    in the english <SENTENCE-END>  he is a proper mans picture but alas who can
    converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited i think he
    bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet
    in germany and his behaviour everywhere <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed
    a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him
    again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety
    and seald under for another <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  how like you the young german the duke of saxonys
    nephew
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most
    vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk <SENTENCE-END>  when he is best he is
    a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little
    better than a beast <SENTENCE-END>  an the worst fall that ever fell i hope i
    shall make shift to go without him <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket
    you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should
    refuse to accept him <SENTENCE-END>   
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep
    glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be
    within and that temptation without i know he will choose it <SENTENCE-END>  i
    will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  you need not fear lady the having any of these lords
    they have acquainted me with their determinations which is
    indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more
    suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers
    imposition depending on the caskets <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as
    diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my fathers will <SENTENCE-END>  i
    am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not
    one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god
    grant them a fair departure <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  do you not remember lady in your fathers time a
    venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of
    the marquis of montferrat
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he calld <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
    lookd upon was the best deserving a fair lady <SENTENCE-END>   
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy
    praise <SENTENCE-END> 

                         enter a servingman

    leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of
    morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here
    tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i
    can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his
    approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion
    of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me <SENTENCE-END> 
    come nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  sirrah go before <SENTENCE-END> 
    whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the
      door <SENTENCE-END>                                                exeunt

    third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he

    he lends out money gratis and brings down
    the rate of usance here with us in venice <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i can catch him once upon the hip
    i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him <SENTENCE-END>

    on me my bargains and my wellwon thrift

    if i forgive him
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  shylock do you hear

    this jacob from our holy abram was
    as his wise mother wrought in his behalf
    the third possessor ay he was the third
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  and what of him did he take interest
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  no not take interest not as you would say
    directly intrest mark what jacob did
    when laban and himself were compromisd
    that all the eanlings which were streakd and pied
    should fall as jacobs hire the ewes being rank  
    in end of autumn turned to the rams
    and when the work of generation was
    between these woolly breeders in the act
    the skilful shepherd pilld me certain wands
    and in the doing of the deed of kind
    he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
    who then conceiving did in eaning time
    fall particolourd lambs and those were jacobs <SENTENCE-END> 
    this was a way to thrive and he was blest
    and thrift is blessing if men steal it not <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  this was a venture sir that jacob servd for
    a thing not in his power to bring to pass
    but swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven <SENTENCE-END>

    or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot tell i make it breed as fast <SENTENCE-END> 
    but note me signior <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>   aside  mark you this bassanio
    the devil can cite scripture for his purpose <SENTENCE-END> 
    an evil soul producing holy witness  
    is like a villain with a smiling cheek
    a goodly apple rotten at the heart <SENTENCE-END>

scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
belmont <SENTENCE-END>  portias house

enter bassanio portia gratiano nerissa and all their trains

  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you tarry pause a day or two
    before you hazard for in choosing wrong
    i lose your company therefore forbear a while <SENTENCE-END> 
    theres something tells me but it is not love
    i would not lose you and you know yourself
    hate counsels not in such a quality <SENTENCE-END> 
    but lest you should not understand me well
    and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
    i would detain you here some month or two
    before you venture for me <SENTENCE-END>  i could teach you
    how to choose right but then i am forsworn
    so will i never be so may you miss me
    but if you do youll make me wish a sin
    that i had been forsworn <SENTENCE-END>  beshrew your eyes
    they have oerlookd me and divided me
    one half of me is yours the other half yours  
    mine own i would say but if mine then yours
    and so all yours <SENTENCE-END>  o these naughty times
    puts bars between the owners and their rights
    and so though yours not yours <SENTENCE-END>  prove it so
    let fortune go to hell for it not i <SENTENCE-END> 
    i speak too long but tis to peize the time
    to eke it and to draw it out in length
    to stay you from election <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  let me choose
    for as i am i live upon the rack <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  upon the rack bassanio then confess
    what treason there is mingled with your love <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  none but that ugly treason of mistrust
    which makes me fear th enjoying of my love
    there may as well be amity and life
    tween snow and fire as treason and my love <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  ay but i fear you speak upon the rack
    where men enforced do speak anything <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  promise me life and ill confess the truth <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  well then confess and live <SENTENCE-END>   
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  confess and love
    had been the very sum of my confession <SENTENCE-END> 
    o happy torment when my torturer
    doth teach me answers for deliverance
    but let me to my fortune and the caskets <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  away then i am lockd in one of them <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you do love me you will find me out <SENTENCE-END> 
    nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
    let music sound while he doth make his choice
    then if he lose he makes a swanlike end
    fading in music <SENTENCE-END>  that the comparison
    may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
    and watry deathbed for him <SENTENCE-END>  he may win
    and what is music then then music is
    even as the flourish when true subjects bow
    to a newcrowned monarch such it is
    as are those dulcet sounds in break of day
    that creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear
    and summon him to marriage <SENTENCE-END>  now he goes
    with no less presence but with much more love  
    than young alcides when he did redeem
    the virgin tribute paid by howling troy
    to the seamonster <SENTENCE-END>  i stand for sacrifice
    the rest aloof are the dardanian wives
    with bleared visages come forth to view
    the issue of th exploit <SENTENCE-END>  go hercules
    live thou i live <SENTENCE-END>  with much much more dismay
    i view the fight than thou that makst the fray <SENTENCE-END> 

                            a song

      the whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself

                 tell me where is fancy bred
                 or in the heart or in the head
                 how begot how nourished
                   reply reply <SENTENCE-END> 
                 it is engendred in the eyes
                 with gazing fed and fancy dies
                 in the cradle where it lies <SENTENCE-END>   
                   let us all ring fancys knell
                   ill begin it ding dong bell <SENTENCE-END> 
  all <SENTENCE-END>            ding dong bell <SENTENCE-END> 

  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  so may the outward shows be least themselves
    the world is still deceivd with ornament <SENTENCE-END> 
    in law what plea so tainted and corrupt
    but being seasond with a gracious voice
    obscures the show of evil in religion
    what damned error but some sober brow
    will bless it and approve it with a text
    hiding the grossness with fair ornament
    there is no vice so simple but assumes
    some mark of virtue on his outward parts <SENTENCE-END> 
    how many cowards whose hearts are all as false
    as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
    the beards of hercules and frowning mars
    who inward searchd have livers white as milk
    and these assume but valours excrement
    to render them redoubted <SENTENCE-END>  look on beauty  
    and you shall see tis purchasd by the weight
    which therein works a miracle in nature
    making them lightest that wear most of it
    so are those crisped snaky golden locks
    which make such wanton gambols with the wind
    upon supposed fairness often known
    to be the dowry of a second head
    the skull that bred them in the sepulchre <SENTENCE-END> 
    thus ornament is but the guiled shore
    to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
    veiling an indian beauty in a word
    the seeming truth which cunning times put on
    to entrap the wisest <SENTENCE-END>  therefore thou gaudy gold
    hard food for midas i will none of thee
    nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
    tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead
    which rather threatenst than dost promise aught
    thy plainness moves me more than eloquence
    and here choose i <SENTENCE-END>  joy be the consequence
  portia <SENTENCE-END>   aside  how all the other passions fleet to air  
    as doubtful thoughts and rashembracd despair
    and shuddring fear and greeneyd jealousy
    o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy
    in measure rain thy joy scant this excess
    i feel too much thy blessing <SENTENCE-END>  make it less
    for fear i surfeit <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>   opening the leaden casket  what find i here
    fair portias counterfeit what demigod
    hath come so near creation move these eyes
    or whether riding on the balls of mine
    seem they in motion here are severd lips
    parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
    should sunder such sweet friends <SENTENCE-END>  here in her hairs
    the painter plays the spider and hath woven
    a golden mesh t entrap the hearts of men
    faster than gnats in cobwebs <SENTENCE-END>  but her eyes
    how could he see to do them having made one
    methinks it should have power to steal both his
    and leave itself unfurnishd <SENTENCE-END>  yet look how far
    the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow  
    in underprizing it so far this shadow
    doth limp behind the substance <SENTENCE-END>  heres the scroll
    the continent and summary of my fortune <SENTENCE-END> 
         you that choose not by the view
         chance as fair and choose as true
         since this fortune falls to you
         be content and seek no new <SENTENCE-END> 
         if you be well pleasd with this
         and hold your fortune for your bliss
         turn to where your lady is
         and claim her with a loving kiss <SENTENCE-END> 
    a gentle scroll <SENTENCE-END>  fair lady by your leave
    i come by note to give and to receive <SENTENCE-END> 
    like one of two contending in a prize
    that thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes
    hearing applause and universal shout
    giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
    whether those peals of praise be his or no
    so thricefair lady stand i even so
    as doubtful whether what i see be true  
    until confirmd signd ratified by you <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  you see me lord bassanio where i stand
    such as i am <SENTENCE-END>  though for myself alone
    i would not be ambitious in my wish
    to wish myself much better yet for you
    i would be trebled twenty times myself
    a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
    that only to stand high in your account
    i might in virtues beauties livings friends
    exceed account <SENTENCE-END>  but the full sum of me
    is sum of something which to term in gross
    is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractisd
    happy in this she is not yet so old
    but she may learn happier than this
    she is not bred so dull but she can learn
    happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
    commits itself to yours to be directed
    as from her lord her governor her king <SENTENCE-END> 
    myself and what is mine to you and yours
    is now converted <SENTENCE-END>  but now i was the lord  
    of this fair mansion master of my servants
    queen oer myself and even now but now
    this house these servants and this same myself
    are yours my lords <SENTENCE-END>  i give them with this ring
    which when you part from lose or give away
    let it presage the ruin of your love
    and be my vantage to exclaim on you <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  madam you have bereft me of all words
    only my blood speaks to you in my veins
    and there is such confusion in my powers
    as after some oration fairly spoke
    by a beloved prince there doth appear
    among the buzzing pleased multitude
    where every something being blent together
    turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
    expressd and not expressd <SENTENCE-END>  but when this ring
    parts from this finger then parts life from hence
    o then be bold to say bassanios dead
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  my lord and lady it is now our time
    that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper  
    to cry good joy <SENTENCE-END>  good joy my lord and lady
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  my lord bassanio and my gentle lady
    i wish you all the joy that you can wish
    for i am sure you can wish none from me
    and when your honours mean to solemnize
    the bargain of your faith i do beseech you
    even at that time i may be married too <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  with all my heart so thou canst get a wife <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  i thank your lordship you have got me one <SENTENCE-END> 
    my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
    you saw the mistress i beheld the maid
    you lovd i lovd for intermission
    no more pertains to me my lord than you <SENTENCE-END> 
    your fortune stood upon the caskets there
    and so did mine too as the matter falls
    for wooing here until i sweat again
    and swearing till my very roof was dry
    with oaths of love at last if promise last
    i got a promise of this fair one here
    to have her love provided that your fortune  
    achievd her mistress <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  is this true nerissa
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  madam it is so you stand pleasd withal <SENTENCE-END>

  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
    that steals the colour from bassanios cheek
    some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
    could turn so much the constitution
    of any constant man <SENTENCE-END>  what worse and worse
    with leave bassanio i am half yourself
    and i must freely have the half of anything
    that this same paper brings you <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  o sweet portia
    here are a few of the unpleasantst words
    that ever blotted paper gentle lady
    when i did first impart my love to you
    i freely told you all the wealth i had
    ran in my veins i was a gentleman
    and then i told you true <SENTENCE-END>  and yet dear lady
    rating myself at nothing you shall see
    how much i was a braggart <SENTENCE-END>  when i told you
    my state was nothing i should then have told you  
    that i was worse than nothing for indeed
    i have engagd myself to a dear friend
    engagd my friend to his mere enemy
    to feed my means <SENTENCE-END>  here is a letter lady
    the paper as the body of my friend
    and every word in it a gaping wound
    issuing lifeblood <SENTENCE-END>  but is it true salerio
    hath all his ventures faild what not one hit
    from tripolis from mexico and england
    from lisbon barbary and india
    and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
    of merchantmarring rocks
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  not one my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    besides it should appear that if he had
    the present money to discharge the jew
    he would not take it <SENTENCE-END>  never did i know
    a creature that did bear the shape of man
    so keen and greedy to confound a man <SENTENCE-END> 
    he plies the duke at morning and at night
    and doth impeach the freedom of the state  
    if they deny him justice <SENTENCE-END>  twenty merchants
    the duke himself and the magnificoes
    of greatest port have all persuaded with him
    but none can drive him from the envious plea
    of forfeiture of justice and his bond <SENTENCE-END> 
  jessica <SENTENCE-END>  when i was with him i have heard him swear
    to tubal and to chus his countrymen
    that he would rather have antonios flesh
    than twenty times the value of the sum
    that he did owe him and i know my lord
    if law authority and power deny not
    it will go hard with poor antonio <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  the dearest friend to me the kindest man
    the best conditiond and unwearied spirit
    in doing courtesies and one in whom
    the ancient roman honour more appears
    than any that draws breath in italy <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  what sum owes he the jew
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  for me three thousand ducats <SENTENCE-END>   
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  what no more
    pay him six thousand and deface the bond
    double six thousand and then treble that
    before a friend of this description
    shall lose a hair through bassanios fault <SENTENCE-END> 
    first go with me to church and call me wife
    and then away to venice to your friend
    for never shall you lie by portias side
    with an unquiet soul <SENTENCE-END>  you shall have gold
    to pay the petty debt twenty times over <SENTENCE-END> 
    when it is paid bring your true friend along <SENTENCE-END> 
    my maid nerissa and myself meantime
    will live as maids and widows <SENTENCE-END>  come away
    for you shall hence upon your wedding day <SENTENCE-END> 
    bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
    since you are dear bought i will love you dear <SENTENCE-END> 
    but let me hear the letter of your friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>   reads  sweet bassanio my ships have all miscarried
    my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the
    jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible i  
    should live all debts are cleard between you and i if i might
    but see you at my death <SENTENCE-END>  notwithstanding use your pleasure if
    your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  o love dispatch all business and be gone
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  since i have your good leave to go away
    i will make haste but till i come again

    thou calldst me dog before thou hadst a cause
    but since i am a dog beware my fangs
    the duke shall grant me justice <SENTENCE-END>  i do wonder
    thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
    to come abroad with him at his request <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee hear me speak <SENTENCE-END>

    he seeks my life his reason well i know

  solanio <SENTENCE-END>  i am sure the duke
    will never grant this forfeiture to hold <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  the duke cannot deny the course of law
    for the commodity that strangers have
    with us in venice if it be denied
    will much impeach the justice of the state
    since that the trade and profit of the city
    consisteth of all nations <SENTENCE-END>  therefore go
    these griefs and losses have so bated me
    that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
    tomorrow to my bloody creditor <SENTENCE-END>

  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  madam although i speak it in your presence
    you have a noble and a true conceit
    of godlike amity which appears most strongly
    in bearing thus the absence of your lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if you knew to whom you show this honour
    how true a gentleman you send relief
    how dear a lover of my lord your husband
    i know you would be prouder of the work
    than customary bounty can enforce you <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i never did repent for doing good
    nor shall not now for in companions
    that do converse and waste the time together
    whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
    there must be needs a like proportion
    of lineaments of manners and of spirit
    which makes me think that this antonio
    being the bosom lover of my lord  
    must needs be like my lord <SENTENCE-END>  if it be so
    how little is the cost i have bestowed
    in purchasing the semblance of my soul
    from out the state of hellish cruelty
    this comes too near the praising of myself
    therefore no more of it hear other things <SENTENCE-END> 
    lorenzo i commit into your hands
    the husbandry and manage of my house
    until my lords return for mine own part
    i have toward heaven breathd a secret vow

    that they shall think we are accomplished
    with that we lack <SENTENCE-END>  ill hold thee any wager
    when we are both accoutred like young men
    ill prove the prettier fellow of the two
    and wear my dagger with the braver grace
    and speak between the change of man and boy
    with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
    into a manly stride and speak of frays
    like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
    how honourable ladies sought my love
    which i denying they fell sick and died
    i could not do withal <SENTENCE-END>  then ill repent
    and wish for all that that i had not killd them <SENTENCE-END>

    my patience to his fury and am armd
    to suffer with a quietness of spirit
    the very tyranny and rage of his <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  go one and call the jew into the court <SENTENCE-END> 
  salerio <SENTENCE-END>  he is ready at the door he comes my lord <SENTENCE-END>   

                          enter shylock

  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  make room and let him stand before our face <SENTENCE-END> 
    shylock the world thinks and i think so too
    that thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice
    to the last hour of act and then tis thought
    thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange
    than is thy strange apparent cruelty
    and where thou now exacts the penalty
    which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh
    thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
    but touchd with human gentleness and love
    forgive a moiety of the principal
    glancing an eye of pity on his losses
    that have of late so huddled on his back
    enow to press a royal merchant down
    and pluck commiseration of his state
    from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
    from stubborn turks and tartars never traind  
    to offices of tender courtesy <SENTENCE-END> 
    we all expect a gentle answer jew <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  i have possessd your grace of what i purpose
    and by our holy sabbath have i sworn
    to have the due and forfeit of my bond <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you deny it let the danger light
    upon your charter and your citys freedom <SENTENCE-END> 
    youll ask me why i rather choose to have
    a weight of carrion flesh than to receive
    three thousand ducats <SENTENCE-END>  ill not answer that
    but say it is my humour is it answerd
    what if my house be troubled with a rat
    and i be pleasd to give ten thousand ducats
    to have it band what are you answerd yet
    some men there are love not a gaping pig
    some that are mad if they behold a cat
    and others when the bagpipe sings i th nose
    cannot contain their urine for affection
    mistress of passion sways it to the mood
    of what it likes or loathes <SENTENCE-END>  now for your answer  
    as there is no firm reason to be rendred
    why he cannot abide a gaping pig
    why he a harmless necessary cat
    why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
    must yield to such inevitable shame
    as to offend himself being offended
    so can i give no reason nor i will not
    more than a lodgd hate and a certain loathing
    i bear antonio that i follow thus
    a losing suit against him <SENTENCE-END>  are you answered
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  this is no answer thou unfeeling man
    to excuse the current of thy cruelty <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  i am not bound to please thee with my answers <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  do all men kill the things they do not love
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  hates any man the thing he would not kill
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  every offence is not a hate at first <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you think you question with the jew <SENTENCE-END> 
    you may as well go stand upon the beach
    and bid the main flood bate his usual height  
    you may as well use question with the wolf
    why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
    you may as well forbid the mountain pines
    to wag their high tops and to make no noise
    when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
    you may as well do anything most hard
    as seek to soften that than which whats harder
    his jewish heart <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i do beseech you
    make no moe offers use no farther means
    but with all brief and plain conveniency
    let me have judgment and the jew his will <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  for thy three thousand ducats here is six <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  if every ducat in six thousand ducats
    were in six parts and every part a ducat
    i would not draw them i would have my bond <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  how shalt thou hope for mercy rendring none
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
    you have among you many a purchasd slave
    which fike your asses and your dogs and mules
    you use in abject and in slavish parts  
    because you bought them shall i say to you
    let them be free marry them to your heirs
    why sweat they under burdens let their beds
    be made as soft as yours and let their palates
    be seasond with such viands you will answer
    the slaves are ours <SENTENCE-END>  so do i answer you
    the pound of flesh which i demand of him
    is dearly bought tis mine and i will have it <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you deny me fie upon your law
    there is no force in the decrees of venice <SENTENCE-END> 
    i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  upon my power i may dismiss this court

    no not the hangmans axe bear half the keenness
    of thy sharp envy <SENTENCE-END>  can no prayers pierce thee

  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  o be thou damnd inexecrable dog
    and for thy life let justice be accusd <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou almost makst me waver in my faith
    to hold opinion with pythagoras
    that souls of animals infuse themselves
    into the trunks of men <SENTENCE-END>  thy currish spirit
    governd a wolf who hangd for human slaughter
    even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
    and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam
    infusd itself in thee for thy desires
    are wolfish bloody starvd and ravenous <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
    thou but offendst thy lungs to speak so loud
    repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
    to cureless ruin <SENTENCE-END>  i stand here for law <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  this letter from bellario doth commend
    a young and learned doctor to our court <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is he
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  he attendeth here hard by
    to know your answer whether youll admit him <SENTENCE-END>   
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  with all my heart <SENTENCE-END>  some three or four of you
    go give him courteous conduct to this place <SENTENCE-END> 
    meantime the court shall hear bellarios letter <SENTENCE-END> 
  clerk <SENTENCE-END>   reads  your grace shall understand that at the receipt
    of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your
    messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor
    of rome his name is balthazar <SENTENCE-END>  i acquainted him with the cause
    in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we
    turnd oer many books together he is furnished with my opinion
    which bettered with his own learningthe greatness whereof i
    cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill
    up your graces request in my stead <SENTENCE-END>  i beseech you let his lack
    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation
    for i never knew so young a body with so old a head <SENTENCE-END>  i leave him
    to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
    commendation <SENTENCE-END> 

      enter portia for balthazar dressed like a doctor of laws

  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  you hear the learnd bellario what he writes  
    and here i take it is the doctor come <SENTENCE-END> 
    give me your hand come you from old bellario
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i did my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  you are welcome take your place <SENTENCE-END> 
    are you acquainted with the difference
    that holds this present question in the court
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i am informed throughly of the cause <SENTENCE-END> 
    which is the merchant here and which the jew
  duke of venice <SENTENCE-END>  antonio and old shylock both stand forth <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  is your name shylock
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  shylock is my name <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  of a strange nature is the suit you follow
    yet in such rule that the venetian law
    cannot impugn you as you do proceed <SENTENCE-END> 
    you stand within his danger do you not
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  ay so he says <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  do you confess the bond
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i do <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  then must the jew be merciful <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  on what compulsion must i tell me that <SENTENCE-END>   
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  the quality of mercy is not straind
    it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
    upon the place beneath <SENTENCE-END>  it is twice blest
    it blesseth him that gives and him that takes <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
    the throned monarch better than his crown
    his sceptre shows the force of temporal power
    the attribute to awe and majesty
    wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
    but mercy is above this sceptred sway
    it is enthroned in the hearts of kings
    it is an attribute to god himself
    and earthly power doth then show likest gods
    when mercy seasons justice <SENTENCE-END>  therefore jew
    though justice be thy plea consider this
    that in the course of justice none of us
    should see salvation we do pray for mercy
    and that same prayer doth teach us all to render
    the deeds of mercy <SENTENCE-END>  i have spoke thus much
    to mitigate the justice of thy plea  
    which if thou follow this strict court of venice
    must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  my deeds upon my head i crave the law
    the penalty and forfeit of my bond <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  yes here i tender it for him in the court
    yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
    i will be bound to pay it ten times oer
    on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
    if this will not suffice it must appear
    that malice bears down truth <SENTENCE-END>  and i beseech you
    wrest once the law to your authority
    to do a great right do a little wrong
    and curb this cruel devil of his will <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  it must not be there is no power in venice
    can alter a decree established
    twill be recorded for a precedent
    and many an error by the same example
    will rush into the state it cannot be <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel
    o wise young judge how i do honour thee  
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you let me look upon the bond <SENTENCE-END>

    shall i lay perjury upon my soul
    no not for venice <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  why this bond is forfeit
    and lawfully by this the jew may claim
    a pound of flesh to be by him cut off
    nearest the merchants heart <SENTENCE-END>  be merciful <SENTENCE-END> 
    take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  when it is paid according to the tenour <SENTENCE-END> 
    it doth appear you are a worthy judge
    you know the law your exposition
    hath been most sound i charge you by the law
    whereof you are a welldeserving pillar
    proceed to judgment <SENTENCE-END>  by my soul i swear
    there is no power in the tongue of man
    to alter me <SENTENCE-END>  i stay here on my bond <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  most heartily i do beseech the court  
    to give the judgment <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  why then thus it is
    you must prepare your bosom for his knife <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  o noble judge o excellent young man
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  for the intent and purpose of the law
    hath full relation to the penalty
    which here appeareth due upon the bond <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  tis very true <SENTENCE-END>  o wise and upright judge
    how much more elder art thou than thy looks
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  therefore lay bare your bosom <SENTENCE-END> 
  shylock <SENTENCE-END>  ay his breast

    give me your hand bassanio fare you well <SENTENCE-END> 
    grieve not that i am falln to this for you
    for herein fortune shows herself more kind
    than is her custom <SENTENCE-END>  it is still her use
    to let the wretched man outlive his wealth
    to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
    an age of poverty from which lingring penance
    of such misery doth she cut me off <SENTENCE-END> 
    commend me to your honourable wife
    tell her the process of antonios end
    say how i lovd you speak me fair in death
    and when the tale is told bid her be judge
    whether bassanio had not once a love <SENTENCE-END>

  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  i have a wife who i protest i love

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
belmont <SENTENCE-END>  the garden before portias house

enter lorenzo and jessica

  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  the moon shines bright <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night as this
    when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
    and they did make no noise in such a night
    troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
    and sighd his soul toward the grecian tents
    where cressid lay that night <SENTENCE-END> 
  jessica <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night
    did thisby fearfully oertrip the dew
    and saw the lions shadow ere himself
    and ran dismayed away <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night
    stood dido with a willow in her hand
    upon the wild seabanks and waft her love
    to come again to carthage <SENTENCE-END> 
  jessica <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night
    medea gathered the enchanted herbs
    that did renew old aeson <SENTENCE-END> 
 lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night  
    did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
    and with an unthrift love did run from venice
    as far as belmont <SENTENCE-END> 
  jessica <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night
    did young lorenzo swear he lovd her well
    stealing her soul with many vows of faith
    and neer a true one <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  in such a night
    did pretty jessica like a little shrew
    slander her love and he forgave it her <SENTENCE-END> 
  jessica <SENTENCE-END>  i would outnight you did no body come
    but hark i hear the footing of a man <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter stephano

  stephano <SENTENCE-END>  a friend <SENTENCE-END>

  stephano <SENTENCE-END>  stephano is my name and i bring word
    my mistress will before the break of day  
    be here at belmont she doth stray about
    by holy crosses where she kneels and prays
    for happy wedlock hours <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  who comes with her
  stephano <SENTENCE-END>  none but a holy hermit and her maid <SENTENCE-END> 
    i pray you is my master yet returnd
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  he is not nor we have not heard from him <SENTENCE-END> 
    but go we in i pray thee jessica
    and ceremoniously let us prepare
    some welcome for the mistress of the house <SENTENCE-END> 

                         enter launcelot

  launcelot <SENTENCE-END>  sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  who calls
  launcelot <SENTENCE-END>  sola did you see master lorenzo master lorenzo sola
    sola
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  leave holloaing man <SENTENCE-END>  here
  launcelot <SENTENCE-END>  sola where where
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  here  
  launcelot <SENTENCE-END>  tell him theres a post come from my master with his
    horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning <SENTENCE-END>

  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  sweet soul lets in and there expect their coming <SENTENCE-END> 
    and yet no matter why should we go in
    my friend stephano signify i pray you
    within the house your mistress is at hand
    and bring your music forth into the air <SENTENCE-END>        exit stephano
    how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
    here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
    become the touches of sweet harmony <SENTENCE-END> 
    sit jessica <SENTENCE-END>  look how the floor of heaven
    is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
    theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst
    but in his motion like an angel sings
    still quiring to the youngeyd cherubins
    such harmony is in immortal souls
    but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it <SENTENCE-END>   

                          enter musicians

    come ho and wake diana with a hymn
    with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear <SENTENCE-END> 
    and draw her home with music <SENTENCE-END>                         music
  jessica <SENTENCE-END>  i am never merry when i hear sweet music <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  the reason is your spirits are attentive
    for do but note a wild and wanton herd
    or race of youthful and unhandled colts
    fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
    which is the hot condition of their blood
    if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
    or any air of music touch their ears
    you shall perceive them make a mutual stand
    their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze
    by the sweet power of music <SENTENCE-END>  therefore the poet
    did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods
    since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
    but music for the time doth change his nature <SENTENCE-END>   
    the man that hath no music in himself
    nor is not movd with concord of sweet sounds
    is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
    the motions of his spirit are dullas night
    and his affections dark as erebus <SENTENCE-END> 
    let no such man be trusted <SENTENCE-END>  mark the music <SENTENCE-END> 

                    enter portia and nerissa

  portia <SENTENCE-END>  that light we see is burning in my hall <SENTENCE-END> 
    how far that little candle throws his beams
    so shines a good deed in a naughty world <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  when the moon shone we did not see the candle <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  so doth the greater glory dim the less
    a substitute shines brightly as a king
    until a king be by and then his state
    empties itself as doth an inland brook
    into the main of waters <SENTENCE-END>  music hark
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  it is your music madam of the house <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  nothing is good i see without respect  
    methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  silence bestows that virtue on it madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
    when neither is attended and i think
    ne nightingale if she should sing by day
    when every goose is cackling would be thought
    no better a musician than the wren <SENTENCE-END> 
    how many things by season seasond are
    to their right praise and true perfection
    peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion
    and would not be awakd <SENTENCE-END>                       music ceases
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  that is the voice
    or i am much deceivd of portia <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
    by the bad voice <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  dear lady welcome home <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  we have been praying for our husbands welfare
    which speed we hope the better for our words <SENTENCE-END> 
    are they returnd
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  madam they are not yet  
    but there is come a messenger before
    to signify their coming <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  go in nerissa
    give order to my servants that they take
    no note at all of our being absent hence
    nor you lorenzo jessica nor you <SENTENCE-END>         a tucket sounds
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet <SENTENCE-END> 
    we are no telltales madam fear you not <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  this night methinks is but the daylight sick
    it looks a little paler tis a day
    such as the day is when the sun is hid <SENTENCE-END> 

       enter bassanio antonio gratiano and their followers

  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  we should hold day with the antipodes
    if you would walk in absence of the sun <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  let me give light but let me not be light
    for a light wife doth make a heavy husband
    and never be bassanio so for me
    but god sort all you are welcome home my lord <SENTENCE-END>   
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  i thank you madam give welcome to my friend <SENTENCE-END> 
    this is the man this is antonio
    to whom i am so infinitely bound <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  you should in all sense be much bound to him
    for as i hear he was much bound for you <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  no more than i am well acquitted of <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  sir you are very welcome to our house <SENTENCE-END> 
    it must appear in other ways than words
    therefore i scant this breathing courtesy <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>   to nerissa  by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong
    in faith i gave it to the judges clerk <SENTENCE-END> 
    would he were gelt that had it for my part
    since you do take it love so much at heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  a quarrel ho already whats the matter
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  about a hoop of gold a paltry ring
    that she did give me whose posy was
    for all the world like cutlers poetry
    upon a knife love me and leave me not <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  what talk you of the posy or the value
    you swore to me when i did give it you  
    that you would wear it till your hour of death
    and that it should lie with you in your grave
    though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
    you should have been respective and have kept it <SENTENCE-END> 
    gave it a judges clerk no gods my judge
    the clerk will neer wear hair ons face that had it <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  he will an if he live to be a man <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  ay if a woman live to be a man <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  now by this hand i gave it to a youth
    a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
    no higher than thyself the judges clerk
    a prating boy that beggd it as a fee
    i could not for my heart deny it him <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  you were to blame i must be plain with you
    to part so slightly with your wifes first gift
    a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
    and so riveted with faith unto your flesh <SENTENCE-END> 
    i gave my love a ring and made him swear
    never to part with it and here he stands
    i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it  
    nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
    that the world masters <SENTENCE-END>  now in faith gratiano
    you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
    an twere to me i should be mad at it <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>   aside  why i were best to cut my left hand off
    and swear i lost the ring defending it <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  my lord bassanio gave his ring away
    unto the judge that beggd it and indeed
    deservd it too and then the boy his clerk
    that took some pains in writing he beggd mine
    and neither man nor master would take aught
    but the two rings <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  what ring gave you my lord
    not that i hope which you receivd of me <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  if i could add a lie unto a fault
    i would deny it but you see my finger
    hath not the ring upon it it is gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  even so void is your false heart of truth
    by heaven i will neer come in your bed
    until i see the ring <SENTENCE-END>   
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  nor i in yours
    till i again see mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  sweet portia
    if you did know to whom i gave the ring
    if you did know for whom i gave the ring
    and would conceive for what i gave the ring
    and how unwillingly i left the ring
    when nought would be accepted but the ring
    you would abate the strength of your displeasure <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  if you had known the virtue of the ring
    or half her worthiness that gave the ring
    or your own honour to contain the ring
    you would not then have parted with the ring <SENTENCE-END> 
    what man is there so much unreasonable
    if you had pleasd to have defended it
    with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
    to urge the thing held as a ceremony
    nerissa teaches me what to believe
    ill die fort but some woman had the ring <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  no by my honour madam by my soul  
    no woman had it but a civil doctor
    which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
    and beggd the ring the which i did deny him
    and sufferd him to go displeasd away
    even he that had held up the very life
    of my dear friend <SENTENCE-END>  what should i say sweet lady
    i was enforcd to send it after him
    i was beset with shame and courtesy
    my honour would not let ingratitude
    so much besmear it <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me good lady
    for by these blessed candles of the night
    had you been there i think you would have beggd
    the ring of me to give the worthy doctor <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  let not that doctor eer come near my house
    since he hath got the jewel that i loved
    and that which you did swear to keep for me
    i will become as liberal as you
    ill not deny him anything i have
    no not my body nor my husbands bed <SENTENCE-END> 
    know him i shall i am well sure of it <SENTENCE-END>   
    lie not a night from home watch me like argus
    if you do not if i be left alone
    now by mine honour which is yet mine own
    ill have that doctor for mine bedfellow <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  and i his clerk therefore be well advisd
    how you do leave me to mine own protection <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  well do you so let not me take him then
    for if i do ill mar the young clerks pen <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i am th unhappy subject of these quarrels <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  sir grieve not you you are welcome not withstanding <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  portia forgive me this enforced wrong
    and in the hearing of these many friends
    i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
    wherein i see myself
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  mark you but that
    in both my eyes he doubly sees himself
    in each eye one swear by your double self
    and theres an oath of credit <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  nay but hear me <SENTENCE-END> 
    pardon this fault and by my soul i swear  
    i never more will break an oath with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i once did lend my body for his wealth
    which but for him that had your husbands ring
    had quite miscarried i dare be bound again
    my soul upon the forfeit that your lord
    will never more break faith advisedly <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  then you shall be his surety <SENTENCE-END>  give him this
    and bid him keep it better than the other <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  i had it of him <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me bassanio
    for by this ring the doctor lay with me <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  and pardon me my gentle gratiano
    for that same scrubbed boy the doctors clerk
    in lieu of this last night did lie with me <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  why this is like the mending of highways
    in summer where the ways are fair enough <SENTENCE-END> 
    what are we cuckolds ere we have deservd it
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  speak not so grossly <SENTENCE-END>  you are all amazd <SENTENCE-END> 
    here is a letter read it at your leisure  
    it comes from padua from bellario
    there you shall find that portia was the doctor
    nerissa there her clerk <SENTENCE-END>  lorenzo here
    shall witness i set forth as soon as you
    and even but now returnd i have not yet
    enterd my house <SENTENCE-END>  antonio you are welcome
    and i have better news in store for you
    than you expect <SENTENCE-END>  unseal this letter soon
    there you shall find three of your argosies
    are richly come to harbour suddenly <SENTENCE-END> 
    you shall not know by what strange accident
    i chanced on this letter <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i am dumb <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  were you the doctor and i knew you not
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  ay but the clerk that never means to do it
    unless he live until he be a man <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassanio <SENTENCE-END>  sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
    when i am absent then lie with my wife <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  sweet lady you have given me life and living  
    for here i read for certain that my ships
    are safely come to road <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  how now lorenzo
    my clerk hath some good comforts too for you <SENTENCE-END> 
  nerissa <SENTENCE-END>  ay and ill give them him without a fee <SENTENCE-END> 
    there do i give to you and jessica
    from the rich jew a special deed of gift
    after his death of all he dies possessd of <SENTENCE-END> 
  lorenzo <SENTENCE-END>  fair ladies you drop manna in the way
    of starved people <SENTENCE-END> 
  portia <SENTENCE-END>  it is almost morning
    and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
    of these events at full <SENTENCE-END>  let us go in
    and charge us there upon intergatories
    and we will answer all things faithfully <SENTENCE-END> 
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>  let it be so <SENTENCE-END>  the first intergatory
    that my nerissa shall be sworn on is
    whether till the next night she had rather stay
    or go to bed now being two hours to day <SENTENCE-END> 
    but were the day come i should wish it dark  
    till i were couching with the doctors clerk <SENTENCE-END> 
    well while i live ill fear no other thing
    so sore as keeping safe nerissas ring <SENTENCE-END>                exeunt

    only bought many presents to give her but have given
    largely to many to know what she would have given
    briefly i have pursud her as love hath pursued me which
    hath been on the wing of all occasions <SENTENCE-END>  but whatsoever i  
    have merited either in my mind or in my means meed i
    am sure i have received none unless experience be a jewel
    that i have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath
    taught me to say this
    love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues
    pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues <SENTENCE-END> 
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  have you receivd no promise of satisfaction at
    her hands

    house the hour she appointed me <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  and sped you sir
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  very illfavouredly master brook <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  how so sir did she change her determination
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END>  master brook but the peaking cornuto her
    husband master brook dwelling in a continual larum of
    jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after
    we had embracd kissd protested and as it were spoke  
    the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his
    companions thither provoked and instigated by his
    distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wifes
    love <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  what while you were there
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  while i was there <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  and did he search for you and could not find you
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  you shall hear <SENTENCE-END>  as good luck would have it comes
    in one mistress page gives intelligence of fords approach
    and in her invention and fords wifes distraction they
    conveyd me into a buckbasket <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  a buckbasket
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  by the lord a buckbasket rammd me in with
    foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy
    napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound
    of villainous smell that ever offended nostril <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  and how long lay you there
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  nay you shall hear master brook what i have
    sufferd to bring this woman to evil for your good <SENTENCE-END>  being
    thus crammd in the basket a couple of fords knaves his  
    hinds were calld forth by their mistress to carry me in
    the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on
    their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the
    door who askd them once or twice what they had in their
    basket <SENTENCE-END>  i quakd for fear lest the lunatic knave would have
    searchd it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold
    held his hand <SENTENCE-END>  well on went he for a search and away
    went i for foul clothes <SENTENCE-END>  but mark the sequel master
    brooki suffered the pangs of three several deaths first
    an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten
    bellwether next to be compassd like a good bilbo in the
    circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and
    then to be stoppd in like a strong distillation with
    stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease <SENTENCE-END>  think of that
    a man of my kidney <SENTENCE-END>  think of thatthat am as subject to
    heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw <SENTENCE-END>  it
    was a miracle to scape suffocation <SENTENCE-END>  and in the height of
    this bath when i was more than halfstewd in grease like
    a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and coold
    glowing hot in that surge like a horseshoe think of that  
    hissing hot <SENTENCE-END>  think of that master brook <SENTENCE-END> 
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  in good sadness sir i am sorry that for my sake you
    have sufferd all this <SENTENCE-END>  my suit then is desperate
    youll undertake her no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  master brook i will be thrown into etna as i
    have been into thames ere i will leave her thus <SENTENCE-END>  her
    husband is this morning gone abirding i have received from
    her another embassy of meeting twixt eight and nine is
    the hour master brook <SENTENCE-END>

  falstaff <SENTENCE-END>  is it i will then address me to my appointment <SENTENCE-END> 
    come to me at your convenient leisure and you shall
    know how i speed and the conclusion shall be crowned
    with your enjoying her <SENTENCE-END>  adieu <SENTENCE-END>  you shall have her master
    brook master brook you shall cuckold ford <SENTENCE-END>             exit
  ford <SENTENCE-END>  hum ha is this a vision is this a dream do i sleep

scene
athens and a wood near it


act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
athens <SENTENCE-END>  the palace of theseus

enter theseus hippolyta philostrate and attendants

  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour
    draws on apace four happy days bring in
    another moon but o methinks how slow
    this old moon wanes she lingers my desires
    like to a stepdame or a dowager
    long withering out a young mans revenue <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  four days will quickly steep themselves in night
    four nights will quickly dream away the time
    and then the moon like to a silver bow
    newbent in heaven shall behold the night
    of our solemnities <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  go philostrate
    stir up the athenian youth to merriments
    awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
    turn melancholy forth to funerals
    the pale companion is not for our pomp <SENTENCE-END>      exit philostrate
    hippolyta i wood thee with my sword  
    and won thy love doing thee injuries
    but i will wed thee in another key
    with pomp with triumph and with revelling <SENTENCE-END> 

          enter egeus and his daughter hermia lysander
                           and demetrius

  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  happy be theseus our renowned duke
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  thanks good egeus whats the news with thee
  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  full of vexation come i with complaint
    against my child my daughter hermia <SENTENCE-END> 
    stand forth demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  my noble lord
    this man hath my consent to marry her <SENTENCE-END> 
    stand forth lysander <SENTENCE-END>  and my gracious duke
    this man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes
    and interchangd lovetokens with my child
    thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
    with feigning voice verses of feigning love
    and stoln the impression of her fantasy  
    with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
    knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
    of strong prevailment in unhardened youth
    with cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart
    turnd her obedience which is due to me
    to stubborn harshness <SENTENCE-END>  and my gracious duke
    be it so she will not here before your grace
    consent to marry with demetrius
    i beg the ancient privilege of athens
    as she is mine i may dispose of her
    which shall be either to this gentleman
    or to her death according to our law
    immediately provided in that case <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  what say you hermia be advisd fair maid <SENTENCE-END> 
    to you your father should be as a god
    one that composd your beauties yea and one
    to whom you are but as a form in wax
    by him imprinted and within his power
    to leave the figure or disfigure it <SENTENCE-END> 
    demetrius is a worthy gentleman <SENTENCE-END>   
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  so is lysander <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  in himself he is
    but in this kind wanting your fathers voice
    the other must be held the worthier <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i would my father lookd but with my eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  rather your eyes must with his judgment look <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i do entreat your grace to pardon me <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know not by what power i am made bold
    nor how it may concern my modesty
    in such a presence here to plead my thoughts
    but i beseech your grace that i may know
    the worst that may befall me in this case
    if i refuse to wed demetrius <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  either to die the death or to abjure
    for ever the society of men <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore fair hermia question your desires
    know of your youth examine well your blood
    whether if you yield not to your fathers choice
    you can endure the livery of a nun
    for aye to be shady cloister mewd  
    to live a barren sister all your life
    chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon <SENTENCE-END> 
    thriceblessed they that master so their blood
    to undergo such maiden pilgrimage
    but earthlier happy is the rose distilld
    than that which withering on the virgin thorn
    grows lives and dies in single blessedness <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  so will i grow so live so die my lord
    ere i will yield my virgin patent up
    unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
    my soul consents not to give sovereignty <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  take time to pause and by the next new moon
    the sealingday betwixt my love and me
    for everlasting bond of fellowship
    upon that day either prepare to die
    for disobedience to your fathers will
    or else to wed demetrius as he would
    or on dianas altar to protest
    for aye austerity and single life <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  relent sweet hermia and lysander yield  
    thy crazed title to my certain right <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  you have her fathers love demetrius
    let me have hermias do you marry him <SENTENCE-END> 
  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  scornful lysander true he hath my love
    and what is mine my love shall render him
    and she is mine and all my right of her
    i do estate unto demetrius <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  i am my lord as well derivd as he
    as well possessd my love is more than his
    my fortunes every way as fairly rankd
    if not with vantage as demetrius
    and which is more than all these boasts can be
    i am belovd of beauteous hermia <SENTENCE-END> 
    why should not i then prosecute my right
    demetrius ill avouch it to his head
    made love to nedars daughter helena
    and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
    devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
    upon this spotted and inconstant man <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  i must confess that i have heard so much  
    and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
    but being overfull of selfaffairs
    my mind did lose it <SENTENCE-END>  but demetrius come
    and come egeus you shall go with me
    i have some private schooling for you both <SENTENCE-END> 
    for you fair hermia look you arm yourself
    to fit your fancies to your fathers will
    or else the law of athens yields you up
    which by no means we may extenuate
    to death or to a vow of single life <SENTENCE-END> 
    come my hippolyta what cheer my love
    demetrius and egeus go along
    i must employ you in some business
    against our nuptial and confer with you
    of something nearly that concerns yourselves <SENTENCE-END> 
  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  with duty and desire we follow you <SENTENCE-END> 
                              exeunt all but lysander and hermia
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  how now my love why is your cheek so pale
    how chance the roses there do fade so fast
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  belike for want of rain which i could well  
    beteem them from the tempest of my eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  ay me for aught that i could ever read
    could ever hear by tale or history
    the course of true love never did run smooth
    but either it was different in blood
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  o cross too high to be enthralld to low <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  or else misgraffed in respect of years
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  o spite too old to be engagd to young <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  or else it stood upon the choice of friends
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  o hell to choose love by anothers eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  or if there were a sympathy in choice
    war death or sickness did lay siege to it
    making it momentary as a sound
    swift as a shadow short as any dream
    brief as the lightning in the collied night
    that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
    and ere a man hath power to say behold
    the jaws of darkness do devour it up
    so quick bright things come to confusion <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  if then true lovers have ever crossd  
    it stands as an edict in destiny <SENTENCE-END> 
    then let us teach our trial patience
    because it is a customary cross
    as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
    wishes and tears poor fancys followers <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have a widow aunt a dowager
    of great revenue and she hath no child
    from athens is her house remote seven leagues
    and she respects me as her only son <SENTENCE-END> 
    there gentle hermia may i marry thee
    and to that place the sharp athenian law
    cannot pursue us <SENTENCE-END>  if thou lovest me then
    steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night
    and in the wood a league without the town
    where i did meet thee once with helena
    to do observance to a morn of may
    there will i stay for thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  my good lysander
    i swear to thee by cupids strongest bow  
    by his best arrow with the golden head
    by the simplicity of venus doves
    by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
    and by that fire which burnd the carthage queen
    when the false troyan under sail was seen
    by all the vows that ever men have broke
    in number more than ever women spoke
    in that same place thou hast appointed me
    tomorrow truly will i meet with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  keep promise love <SENTENCE-END>  look here comes helena <SENTENCE-END> 

                         enter helena

  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  god speed fair helena whither away
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  call you me fair that fair again unsay <SENTENCE-END> 
    demetrius loves your fair <SENTENCE-END>  o happy fair
    your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air
    more tuneable than lark to shepherds ear
    when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear <SENTENCE-END> 
    sickness is catching o were favour so  
    yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go
    my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
    my tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody <SENTENCE-END> 
    were the world mine demetrius being bated
    the rest id give to be to you translated <SENTENCE-END> 
    o teach me how you look and with what art
    you sway the motion of demetrius heart
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i frown upon him yet he loves me still <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i give him curses yet he gives me love <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  o that my prayers could such affection move
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  the more i hate the more he follows me <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  the more i love the more he hateth me <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  his folly helena is no fault of mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  none but your beauty would that fault were mine
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  take comfort he no more shall see my face
    lysander and myself will fly this place <SENTENCE-END> 
    before the time i did lysander see
    seemd athens as a paradise to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    o then what graces in my love do dwell  
    that he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  helen to you our minds we will unfold
    tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold
    her silver visage in the watry glass
    decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
    a time that lovers flights doth still conceal
    through athens gates have we devisd to steal <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  and in the wood where often you and i
    upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie
    emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
    there my lysander and myself shall meet
    and thence from athens turn away our eyes
    to seek new friends and stranger companies <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
    and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
    keep word lysander we must starve our sight
    from lovers food till morrow deep midnight <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  i will my hermia <SENTENCE-END>  exit hermia helena adieu
    as you on him demetrius dote on you <SENTENCE-END>                    exit
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  how happy some oer other some can be  
    through athens i am thought as fair as she <SENTENCE-END> 
    but what of that demetrius thinks not so
    he will not know what all but he do know <SENTENCE-END> 
    and as he errs doting on hermias eyes
    so i admiring of his qualities <SENTENCE-END> 
    things base and vile holding no quantity
    love can transpose to form and dignity <SENTENCE-END> 
    love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
    and therefore is wingd cupid painted blind <SENTENCE-END> 
    nor hath loves mind of any judgment taste
    wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
    and therefore is love said to be a child
    because in choice he is so oft beguild <SENTENCE-END> 
    as waggish boys in game themselves forswear
    so the boy love is perjurd everywhere
    for ere demetrius lookd on hermias eyne
    he haild down oaths that he was only mine
    and when this hail some heat from hermia felt
    so he dissolvd and showrs of oaths did melt <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will go tell him of fair hermias flight  
    then to the wood will he tomorrow night
    pursue her and for this intelligence
    if i have thanks it is a dear expense <SENTENCE-END> 
    but herein mean i to enrich my pain
    to have his sight thither and back again <SENTENCE-END>                exit

act ii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
a wood near athens

enter a fairy at one door and puck at another

  puck <SENTENCE-END>  how now spirit whither wander you
  fairy <SENTENCE-END>       over hill over dale
                thorough bush thorough brier
              over park over pale
                thorough flood thorough fire
              i do wander every where
              swifter than the moons sphere
              and i serve the fairy queen
              to dew her orbs upon the green <SENTENCE-END> 
              the cowslips tall her pensioners be
              in their gold coats spots you see
              those be rubies fairy favours
              in those freckles live their savours <SENTENCE-END> 

    i must go seek some dewdrops here
    and hang a pearl in every cowslips ear <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell thou lob of spirits ill be gone <SENTENCE-END>   
    our queen and all her elves come here anon <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  the king doth keep his revels here tonight
    take heed the queen come not within his sight
    for oberon is passing fell and wrath
    because that she as her attendant hath
    a lovely boy stolen from an indian king <SENTENCE-END> 
    she never had so sweet a changeling
    and jealous oberon would have the child
    knight of his train to trace the forests wild
    but she perforce withholds the loved boy
    crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy <SENTENCE-END> 
    and now they never meet in grove or green
    by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
    but they do square that all their elves for fear
    creep into acorn cups and hide them there <SENTENCE-END> 
  fairy <SENTENCE-END>  either i mistake your shape and making quite
    or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
    calld robin goodfellow <SENTENCE-END>  are not you he
    that frights the maidens of the villagery
    skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern  
    and bootless make the breathless housewife churn
    and sometime make the drink to bear no barm
    mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
    those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck
    you do their work and they shall have good luck <SENTENCE-END> 
    are not you he
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  thou speakest aright
    i am that merry wanderer of the night <SENTENCE-END> 
    i jest to oberon and make him smile
    when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile
    neighing in likeness of a filly foal
    and sometime lurk i in a gossips bowl
    in very likeness of a roasted crab
    and when she drinks against her lips i bob
    and on her withered dewlap pour the ale <SENTENCE-END> 
    the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
    sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
    then slip i from her bum down topples she
    and tailor cries and falls into a cough
    and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh  
    and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
    a merrier hour was never wasted there <SENTENCE-END> 
    but room fairy here comes oberon <SENTENCE-END> 
  fairy <SENTENCE-END>  and here my mistress <SENTENCE-END>  would that he were gone

       enter oberon at one door with his train and titania
                        at another with hers

  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  ill met by moonlight proud titania <SENTENCE-END> 
  titania <SENTENCE-END>  what jealous oberon fairies skip hence
    i have forsworn his bed and company <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
  titania <SENTENCE-END>  then i must be thy lady but i know
    when thou hast stolen away from fairy land
    and in the shape of corin sat all day
    playing on pipes of corn and versing love
    to amorous phillida <SENTENCE-END>  why art thou here
    come from the farthest steep of india
    but that forsooth the bouncing amazon
    your buskind mistress and your warrior love  
    to theseus must be wedded and you come
    to give their bed joy and prosperity
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  how canst thou thus for shame titania
    glance at my credit with hippolyta
    knowing i know thy love to theseus
    didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
    from perigouna whom he ravished
    and make him with fair aegles break his faith
    with ariadne and antiopa
  titania <SENTENCE-END>  these are the forgeries of jealousy
    and never since the middle summers spring
    met we on hill in dale forest or mead
    by paved fountain or by rushy brook
    or in the beached margent of the sea
    to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
    but with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore the winds piping to us in vain
    as in revenge have suckd up from the sea
    contagious fogs which falling in the land
    hath every pelting river made so proud  
    that they have overborne their continents <SENTENCE-END> 
    the ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain
    the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
    hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard
    the fold stands empty in the drowned field
    and crows are fatted with the murrion flock
    the nine mens morris is filld up with mud
    and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
    for lack of tread are undistinguishable <SENTENCE-END> 
    the human mortals want their winter here
    no night is now with hymn or carol blest
    therefore the moon the governess of floods
    pale in her anger washes all the air
    that rheumatic diseases do abound <SENTENCE-END> 
    and thorough this distemperature we see
    the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts
    fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
    and on old hiems thin and icy crown
    an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
    is as in mockery set <SENTENCE-END>  the spring the summer  
    the childing autumn angry winter change
    their wonted liveries and the mazed world
    by their increase now knows not which is which <SENTENCE-END> 
    and this same progeny of evils comes
    from our debate from our dissension
    we are their parents and original <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  do you amend it then it lies in you <SENTENCE-END> 
    why should titania cross her oberon
    i do but beg a little changeling boy
    to be my henchman <SENTENCE-END> 
  titania <SENTENCE-END>  set your heart at rest
    the fairy land buys not the child of me <SENTENCE-END> 
    his mother was a votress of my order
    and in the spiced indian air by night
    full often hath she gossipd by my side
    and sat with me on neptunes yellow sands
    marking th embarked traders on the flood
    when we have laughd to see the sails conceive
    and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
    which she with pretty and with swimming gait  
    following her womb then rich with my young squire
    would imitate and sail upon the land
    to fetch me trifles and return again
    as from a voyage rich with merchandise <SENTENCE-END> 
    but she being mortal of that boy did die
    and for her sake do i rear up her boy
    and for her sake i will not part with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  how long within this wood intend you stay
  titania <SENTENCE-END>  perchance till after theseus weddingday <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you will patiently dance in our round
    and see our moonlight revels go with us
    if not shun me and i will spare your haunts <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  give me that boy and i will go with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  titania <SENTENCE-END>  not for thy fairy kingdom <SENTENCE-END>  fairies away <SENTENCE-END> 
    we shall chide downright if i longer stay <SENTENCE-END> 
                                     exit titania with her train
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
    till i torment thee for this injury <SENTENCE-END> 
    my gentle puck come hither <SENTENCE-END>  thou remembrest
    since once i sat upon a promontory  
    and heard a mermaid on a dolphins back
    uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
    that the rude sea grew civil at her song
    and certain stars shot madly from their spheres
    to hear the seamaids music <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  i remember <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  that very time i saw but thou couldst not
    flying between the cold moon and the earth
    cupid all armd a certain aim he took
    at a fair vestal throned by the west
    and loosd his loveshaft smartly from his bow
    as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
    but i might see young cupids fiery shaft
    quenchd in the chaste beams of the watry moon
    and the imperial votress passed on
    in maiden meditation fancyfree <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet markd i where the bolt of cupid fell <SENTENCE-END> 
    it fell upon a little western flower
    before milkwhite now purple with loves wound
    and maidens call it loveinidleness <SENTENCE-END>   
    fetch me that flowr the herb i showed thee once <SENTENCE-END> 
    the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
    will make or man or woman madly dote
    upon the next live creature that it sees <SENTENCE-END> 
    fetch me this herb and be thou here again
    ere the leviathan can swim a league <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  ill put a girdle round about the earth
    in forty minutes <SENTENCE-END>                                   exit puck
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  having once this juice
    ill watch titania when she is asleep
    and drop the liquor of it in her eyes
    the next thing then she waking looks upon
    be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
    on meddling monkey or on busy ape
    she shall pursue it with the soul of love <SENTENCE-END> 
    and ere i take this charm from off her sight
    as i can take it with another herb
    ill make her render up her page to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    but who comes here i am invisible
    and i will overhear their conference <SENTENCE-END>   

               enter demetrius helena following him

  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  i love thee not therefore pursue me not <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is lysander and fair hermia
    the one ill slay the other slayeth me <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou toldst me they were stoln unto this wood
    and here am i and wood within this wood
    because i cannot meet my hermia <SENTENCE-END> 
    hence get thee gone and follow me no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  you draw me you hardhearted adamant
    but yet you draw not iron for my heart
    is true as steel <SENTENCE-END>  leave you your power to draw
    and i shall have no power to follow you <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  do i entice you do i speak you fair
    or rather do i not in plainest truth
    tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  and even for that do i love you the more <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am your spaniel and demetrius
    the more you beat me i will fawn on you <SENTENCE-END>   
    use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
    neglect me lose me only give me leave
    unworthy as i am to follow you <SENTENCE-END> 
    what worser place can i beg in your love
    and yet a place of high respect with me
    than to be used as you use your dog
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
    for i am sick when i do look on thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  and i am sick when i look not on you <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  you do impeach your modesty too much
    to leave the city and commit yourself
    into the hands of one that loves you not
    to trust the opportunity of night
    and the ill counsel of a desert place
    with the rich worth of your virginity <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  your virtue is my privilege for that
    it is not night when i do see your face
    therefore i think i am not in the night
    nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
    for you in my respect are all the world <SENTENCE-END>   
    then how can it be said i am alone
    when all the world is here to look on me
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes
    and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  the wildest hath not such a heart as you <SENTENCE-END> 
    run when you will the story shall be changd
    apollo flies and daphne holds the chase
    the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
    makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
    when cowardice pursues and valour flies <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  i will not stay thy questions let me go
    or if thou follow me do not believe
    but i shall do thee mischief in the wood <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  ay in the temple in the town the field
    you do me mischief <SENTENCE-END>  fie demetrius
    your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex <SENTENCE-END> 
    we cannot fight for love as men may do
    we should be wood and were not made to woo <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                  exit demetrius
    ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell  
    to die upon the hand i love so well <SENTENCE-END>              exit helena
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
    thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love <SENTENCE-END> 

                            reenter puck

    hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  ay there it is <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee give it me <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know a bank where the wild thyme blows
    where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
    quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
    with sweet muskroses and with eglantine
    there sleeps titania sometime of the night
    lulld in these flowers with dances and delight
    and there the snake throws her enamelld skin
    weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
    and with the juice of this ill streak her eyes
    and make her full of hateful fantasies <SENTENCE-END> 
    take thou some of it and seek through this grove  
    a sweet athenian lady is in love
    with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
    but do it when the next thing he espies
    may be the lady <SENTENCE-END>  thou shalt know the man
    by the athenian garments he hath on <SENTENCE-END> 
    effect it with some care that he may prove
    more fond on her than she upon her love <SENTENCE-END> 
    and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  fear not my lord your servant shall do so <SENTENCE-END>       exeunt

             night and silence who is here
             weeds of athens he doth wear

    for she hath blessed and attractive eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears
    if so my eyes are oftner washd than hers <SENTENCE-END> 
    no no i am as ugly as a bear
    for beasts that meet me run away for fear
    therefore no marvel though demetrius
    do as a monster fly my presence thus <SENTENCE-END> 
    what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
    made me compare with hermias sphery eyne

    what though he love your hermia lord what though
    yet hermia still loves you then be content <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  content with hermia no i do repent
    the tedious minutes i with her have spent <SENTENCE-END> 
    not hermia but helena i love
    who will not change a raven for a dove
    the will of man is by his reason swayd
    and reason says you are the worthier maid <SENTENCE-END> 
    things growing are not ripe until their season
    so i being young till now ripe not to reason
    and touching now the point of human skill
    reason becomes the marshal to my will

scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
another part of the wood

enter oberon

  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  i wonder if titania be awakd
    then what it was that next came in her eye
    which she must dote on in extremity <SENTENCE-END> 

                          enter puck

    here comes my messenger <SENTENCE-END>  how now mad spirit
    what nightrule now about this haunted grove
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  my mistress with a monster is in love <SENTENCE-END> 
    near to her close and consecrated bower
    while she was in her dull and sleeping hour
    a crew of patches rude mechanicals
    that work for bread upon athenian stalls
    were met together to rehearse a play
    intended for great theseus nuptial day <SENTENCE-END> 
    the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
    who pyramus presented in their sport
    forsook his scene and entred in a brake  
    when i did him at this advantage take
    an asss nole i fixed on his head <SENTENCE-END> 
    anon his thisby must be answered
    and forth my mimic comes <SENTENCE-END>  when they him spy
    as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
    or russetpated choughs many in sort
    rising and cawing at the guns report
    sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
    so at his sight away his fellows fly
    and at our stamp here oer and oer one falls
    he murder cries and help from athens calls <SENTENCE-END> 
    their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong
    made senseless things begin to do them wrong
    for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
    some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch <SENTENCE-END> 
    i led them on in this distracted fear
    and left sweet pyramus translated there
    when in that moment so it came to pass
    titania wakd and straightway lovd an ass <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  this falls out better than i could devise <SENTENCE-END>   
    but hast thou yet latchd the athenians eyes
    with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  i took him sleeping that is finishd too
    and the athenian woman by his side
    that when he wakd of force she must be eyd <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter demetrius and hermia

  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  stand close this is the same athenian <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  this is the woman but not this the man <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  o why rebuke you him that loves you so
    lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  now i but chide but i should use thee worse
    for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse <SENTENCE-END> 
    if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep
    being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep
    and kill me too <SENTENCE-END> 
    the sun was not so true unto the day
    as he to me <SENTENCE-END>  would he have stolen away
    from sleeping hermia ill believe as soon  
    this whole earth may be bord and that the moon
    may through the centre creep and so displease
    her brothers noontide with th antipodes <SENTENCE-END> 
    it cannot be but thou hast murdred him
    so should a murderer look so dead so grim <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  so should the murdered look and so should i
    piercd through the heart with your stern cruelty
    yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
    as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  whats this to my lysander where is he
    ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  i had rather give his carcass to my hounds <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  out dog out cur thou drivst me past the bounds
    of maidens patience <SENTENCE-END>  hast thou slain him then
    henceforth be never numbred among men
    o once tell true tell true even for my sake
    durst thou have lookd upon him being awake
    and hast thou killd him sleeping o brave touch
    could not a worm an adder do so much
    an adder did it for with doubler tongue  
    than thine thou serpent never adder stung <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  you spend your passion on a misprisd mood
    i am not guilty of lysanders blood
    nor is he dead for aught that i can tell <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee tell me then that he is well <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  an if i could what should i get therefore
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  a privilege never to see me more <SENTENCE-END> 
    and from thy hated presence part i so
    see me no more whether he be dead or no <SENTENCE-END>                 exit
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  there is no following her in this fierce vein
    here therefore for a while i will remain <SENTENCE-END> 
    so sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow
    for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
    which now in some slight measure it will pay
    if for his tender here i make some stay <SENTENCE-END>          lies down
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite
    and laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight <SENTENCE-END> 
    of thy misprision must perforce ensue
    some true love turnd and not a false turnd true <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  then fate oerrules that one man holding troth  
    a million fail confounding oath on oath <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  about the wood go swifter than the wind
    and helena of athens look thou find
    all fancysick she is and pale of cheer
    with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear <SENTENCE-END> 
    by some illusion see thou bring her here
    ill charm his eyes against she do appear <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  i go i go look how i go
    swifter than arrow from the tartars bow <SENTENCE-END>                exit
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>        flower of this purple dye
                hit with cupids archery
                sink in apple of his eye <SENTENCE-END> 
                when his love he doth espy
                let her shine as gloriously
                as the venus of the sky <SENTENCE-END> 
                when thou wakst if she be by
                beg of her for remedy <SENTENCE-END> 

                       reenter puck
  
  puck <SENTENCE-END>          captain of our fairy band
                helena is here at hand
                and the youth mistook by me
                pleading for a lovers fee
                shall we their fond pageant see
                lord what fools these mortals be
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>        stand aside <SENTENCE-END>  the noise they make
                will cause demetrius to awake <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>          then will two at once woo one <SENTENCE-END> 
                that must needs be sport alone
                and those things do best please me
                that befall prepostrously <SENTENCE-END> 

                   enter lysander and helena

  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  why should you think that i should woo in scorn
    scorn and derision never come in tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    look when i vow i weep and vows so born
    in their nativity all truth appears <SENTENCE-END> 
    how can these things in me seem scorn to you  
    bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  you do advance your cunning more and more <SENTENCE-END> 
    when truth kills truth o devilishholy fray
    these vows are hermias <SENTENCE-END>  will you give her oer
    weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
    your vows to her and me put in two scales
    will even weigh and both as light as tales <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  i hod no judgment when to her i swore <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  nor none in my mind now you give her oer <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  demetrius loves her and he loves not you <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  awaking o helen goddess nymph perfect divine
    to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
    crystal is muddy <SENTENCE-END>  o how ripe in show
    thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
    that pure congealed white high taurus snow
    fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
    when thou holdst up thy hand <SENTENCE-END>  o let me kiss
    this princess of pure white this seal of bliss
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  o spite o hell i see you all are bent
    to set against me for your merriment <SENTENCE-END>   
    if you were civil and knew courtesy
    you would not do me thus much injury <SENTENCE-END> 
    can you not hate me as i know you do
    but you must join in souls to mock me too
    if you were men as men you are in show
    you would not use a gentle lady so
    to vow and swear and superpraise my parts
    when i am sure you hate me with your hearts <SENTENCE-END> 
    you both are rivals and love hermia
    and now both rivals to mock helena <SENTENCE-END> 
    a trim exploit a manly enterprise
    to conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes
    with your derision none of noble sort
    would so offend a virgin and extort
    a poor souls patience all to make you sport <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  you are unkind demetrius be not so
    for you love hermia <SENTENCE-END>  this you know i know
    and here with all good will with all my heart
    in hermias love i yield you up my part
    and yours of helena to me bequeath  
    whom i do love and will do till my death <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  never did mockers waste more idle breath <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  lysander keep thy hermia i will none <SENTENCE-END> 
    if eer i lovd her all that love is gone <SENTENCE-END> 
    my heart to her but as guestwise sojournd
    and now to helen is it home returnd
    there to remain <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  helen it is not so <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  disparage not the faith thou dost not know
    lest to thy peril thou aby it dear <SENTENCE-END> 
    look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter hermia

  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  dark night that from the eye his function takes
    the ear more quick of apprehension makes
    wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
    it pays the hearing double recompense <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou art not by mine eye lysander found
    mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound <SENTENCE-END>   
    but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  why should he stay whom love doth press to go
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  what love could press lysander from my side
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  lysanders love that would not let him bide
    fair helena who more engilds the night
    than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light <SENTENCE-END> 
    why seekst thou me could not this make thee know
    the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  you speak not as you think it cannot be <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  lo she is one of this confederacy
    now i perceive they have conjoind all three
    to fashion this false sport in spite of me <SENTENCE-END> 
    injurious hermia most ungrateful maid
    have you conspird have you with these contrivd
    to bait me with this foul derision
    is all the counsel that we two have shard
    the sisters vows the hours that we have spent
    when we have chid the hastyfooted time
    for parting us o is all forgot
    all schooldays friendship childhood innocence  
    we hermia like two artificial gods
    have with our needles created both one flower
    both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
    both warbling of one song both in one key
    as if our hands our sides voices and minds
    had been incorporate <SENTENCE-END>  so we grew together
    like to a double cherry seeming parted
    but yet an union in partition
    two lovely berries moulded on one stern
    so with two seeming bodies but one heart
    two of the first like coats in heraldry
    due but to one and crowned with one crest <SENTENCE-END> 
    and will you rent our ancient love asunder
    to join with men in scorning your poor friend
    it is not friendly tis not maidenly
    our sex as well as i may chide you for it
    though i alone do feel the injury <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i am amazed at your passionate words
    i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  have you not set lysander as in scorn  
    to follow me and praise my eyes and face
    and made your other love demetrius
    who even but now did spurn me with his foot
    to call me goddess nymph divine and rare
    precious celestial wherefore speaks he this
    to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander
    deny your love so rich within his soul
    and tender me forsooth affection
    but by your setting on by your consent
    what though i be not so in grace as you
    so hung upon with love so fortunate
    but miserable most to love unlovd
    this you should pity rather than despise <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i understand not what you mean by this <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
    make mouths upon me when i turn my back
    wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
    this sport well carried shall be chronicled <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you have any pity grace or manners
    you would not make me such an argument <SENTENCE-END>   
    but fare ye well tis partly my own fault
    which death or absence soon shall remedy <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  stay gentle helena hear my excuse
    my love my life my soul fair helena
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  o excellent
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  sweet do not scorn her so <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  if she cannot entreat i can compel <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  thou canst compel no more than she entreat
    thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
    helen i love thee by my life i do
    i swear by that which i will lose for thee
    to prove him false that says i love thee not <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  i say i love thee more than he can do <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  if thou say so withdraw and prove it too <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  quick come <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  lysander whereto tends all this
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  away you ethiope
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  no no he will
    seem to break loose take on as you would follow
    but yet come not <SENTENCE-END>  you are a tame man go  
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
    or i will shake thee from me like a serpent <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  why are you grown so rude what change is this
    sweet love
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  thy love out tawny tartar out
    out loathed medcine o hated potion hence
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  do you not jest
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  yes sooth and so do you <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  demetrius i will keep my word with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  i would i had your bond for i perceive
    a weak bond holds you ill not trust your word <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
    although i hate her ill not harm her so <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  what can you do me greater harm than hate
    hate me wherefore o me what news my love
    am not i hermia are not you lysander
    i am as fair now as i was erewhile <SENTENCE-END> 
    since night you lovd me yet since night you left me <SENTENCE-END> 
    why then you left me o the gods forbid
    in earnest shall i say  
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  ay by my life
    and never did desire to see thee more <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
    be certain nothing truer tis no jest
    that i do hate thee and love helena <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  o me you juggler you cankerblossom
    you thief of love what have you come by night
    and stoln my loves heart from him
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  fine i faith
    have you no modesty no maiden shame
    no touch of bashfulness what will you tear
    impatient answers from my gentle tongue
    fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  puppet why so ay that way goes the game <SENTENCE-END> 
    now i perceive that she hath made compare
    between our statures she hath urgd her height
    and with her personage her tall personage
    her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him <SENTENCE-END> 
    and are you grown so high in his esteem
    because i am so dwarfish and so low  
    how low am i thou painted maypole speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    how low am i i am not yet so low
    but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you though you mock me gentlemen
    let her not hurt me <SENTENCE-END>  i was never curst
    i have no gift at all in shrewishness
    i am a right maid for my cowardice
    let her not strike me <SENTENCE-END>  you perhaps may think
    because she is something lower than myself
    that i can match her <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  lower hark again <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  good hermia do not be so bitter with me <SENTENCE-END> 
    i evermore did love you hermia
    did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you
    save that in love unto demetrius
    i told him of your stealth unto this wood <SENTENCE-END> 
    he followed you for love i followed him
    but he hath chid me hence and threatned me
    to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
    and now so you will let me quiet go  
    to athens will i bear my folly back
    and follow you no further <SENTENCE-END>  let me go <SENTENCE-END> 
    you see how simple and how fond i am <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  why get you gone who ist that hinders you
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  a foolish heart that i leave here behind <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  what with lysander
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  with demetrius <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  no sir she shall not though you take her part <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  o when she is angry she is keen and shrewd
    she was a vixen when she went to school
    and though she be but little she is fierce <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  little again nothing but low and little
    why will you suffer her to flout me thus
    let me come to her <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  get you gone you dwarf
    you minimus of hindring knotgrass made
    you bead you acorn <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  you are too officious
    in her behalf that scorns your services <SENTENCE-END>   
    let her alone speak not of helena
    take not her part for if thou dost intend
    never so little show of love to her
    thou shalt aby it <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  now she holds me not <SENTENCE-END> 
    now follow if thou darst to try whose right
    of thine or mine is most in helena <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  follow nay ill go with thee cheek by jowl <SENTENCE-END> 
                                   exeunt lysander and demetrius
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  you mistress all this coil is long of you <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay go not back <SENTENCE-END> 
  helena <SENTENCE-END>  i will not trust you i
    nor longer stay in your curst company <SENTENCE-END> 
    your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
    my legs are longer though to run away <SENTENCE-END>                  exit
  hermia <SENTENCE-END>  i am amazd and know not what to say <SENTENCE-END>             exit
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  this is thy negligence <SENTENCE-END>  still thou mistakst
    or else committst thy knaveries wilfully <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  believe me king of shadows i mistook <SENTENCE-END> 
    did not you tell me i should know the man  
    by the athenian garments he had on
    and so far blameless proves my enterprise
    that i have nointed an athenians eyes
    and so far am i glad it so did sort
    as this their jangling i esteem a sport <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight <SENTENCE-END> 
    hie therefore robin overcast the night
    the starry welkin cover thou anon
    with drooping fog as black as acheron
    and lead these testy rivals so astray
    as one come not within anothers way <SENTENCE-END> 
    like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue
    then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong
    and sometime rail thou like demetrius
    and from each other look thou lead them thus
    till oer their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep
    with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep <SENTENCE-END> 
    then crush this herb into lysanders eye
    whose liquor hath this virtuous property
    to take from thence all error with his might  
    and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight <SENTENCE-END> 
    when they next wake all this derision
    shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
    and back to athens shall the lovers wend
    with league whose date till death shall never end <SENTENCE-END> 
    whiles i in this affair do thee employ
    ill to my queen and beg her indian boy
    and then i will her charmed eye release
    from monsters view and all things shall be peace <SENTENCE-END> 
  puck <SENTENCE-END>  my fairy lord this must be done with haste
    for nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
    and yonder shines auroras harbinger
    at whose approach ghosts wandring here and there
    troop home to churchyards <SENTENCE-END>  damned spirits all
    that in crossways and floods have burial
    already to their wormy beds are gone
    for fear lest day should look their shames upon
    they wilfully themselves exild from light
    and must for aye consort with blackbrowd night <SENTENCE-END> 
  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  but we are spirits of another sort  
    i with the mornings love have oft made sport
    and like a forester the groves may tread
    even till the eastern gate all fiery red
    opening on neptune with fair blessed beams
    turns into yellow gold his salt green streams <SENTENCE-END> 
    but notwithstanding haste make no delay
    we may effect this business yet ere day <SENTENCE-END>          exit oberon
  puck <SENTENCE-END>       up and down up and down
             i will lead them up and down <SENTENCE-END>

    when i come where he calls then he is gone <SENTENCE-END>

    i followed fast but faster he did fly  
    that fallen am i in dark uneven way
    and here will rest me <SENTENCE-END>  lies down come thou gentle day <SENTENCE-END> 
    for if but once thou show me thy grey light

  oberon <SENTENCE-END>  advancing welcome good robin <SENTENCE-END>  seest thou this sweet
      sight
    her dotage now i do begin to pity
    for meeting her of late behind the wood
    seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool
    i did upbraid her and fall out with her <SENTENCE-END> 
    for she his hairy temples then had rounded
    with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
    and that same dew which sometime on the buds  
    was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
    stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
    like tears that did their own disgrace bewail <SENTENCE-END> 
    when i had at my pleasure taunted her
    and she in mild terms beggd my patience
    i then did ask of her her changeling child
    which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
    to bear him to my bower in fairy land <SENTENCE-END> 
    and now i have the boy i will undo
    this hateful imperfection of her eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    and gentle puck take this transformed scalp
    from off the head of this athenian swain
    that he awaking when the other do
    may all to athens back again repair
    and think no more of this nights accidents
    but as the fierce vexation of a dream <SENTENCE-END> 
    but first i will release the fairy queen <SENTENCE-END> 
                                             touching her eyes
           be as thou wast wont to be
           see as thou was wont to see <SENTENCE-END>

  titania <SENTENCE-END>     come my lord and in our flight
              tell me how it came this night
              that i sleeping here was found
              with these mortals on the ground <SENTENCE-END>            exeunt

        to the winding of horns enter theseus hippolyta
                      egeus and train

  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  go one of you find out the forester
    for now our observation is performd
    and since we have the vaward of the day
    my love shall hear the music of my hounds <SENTENCE-END>   
    uncouple in the western valley let them go <SENTENCE-END> 
    dispatch i say and find the forester <SENTENCE-END>     exit an attendant
    we will fair queen up to the mountains top
    and mark the musical confusion
    of hounds and echo in conjunction <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  i was with hercules and cadmus once
    when in a wood of crete they bayd the bear
    with hounds of sparta never did i hear
    such gallant chiding for besides the groves
    the skies the fountains every region near
    seemd all one mutual cry <SENTENCE-END>  i never heard
    so musical a discord such sweet thunder <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind
    so flewd so sanded and their heads are hung
    with ears that sweep away the morning dew
    crookkneed and dewlappd like thessalian bulls
    slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells
    each under each <SENTENCE-END>  a cry more tuneable
    was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn
    in crete in sparta nor in thessaly <SENTENCE-END>   
    judge when you hear <SENTENCE-END>  but soft what nymphs are these
  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  my lord this is my daughter here asleep
    and this lysander this demetrius is
    this helena old nedars helena <SENTENCE-END> 
    i wonder of their being here together <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  no doubt they rose up early to observe
    the rite of may and hearing our intent
    came here in grace of our solemnity <SENTENCE-END> 
    but speak egeus is not this the day
    that hermia should give answer of her choice
  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  it is my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns <SENTENCE-END> 
                           horns and shout within <SENTENCE-END>  the sleepers
                                     awake and kneel to theseus
    goodmorrow friends <SENTENCE-END>  saint valentine is past
    begin these woodbirds but to couple now
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  pardon my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you all stand up <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know you two are rival enemies
    how comes this gentle concord in the world  
    that hatred is so far from jealousy
    to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i shall reply amazedly
    half sleep half waking but as yet i swear
    i cannot truly say how i came here
    but as i think for truly would i speak
    and now i do bethink me so it is
    i came with hermia hither <SENTENCE-END>  our intent
    was to be gone from athens where we might
    without the peril of the athenian law
  egeus <SENTENCE-END>  enough enough my lord you have enough
    i beg the law the law upon his head <SENTENCE-END> 
    they would have stoln away they would demetrius
    thereby to have defeated you and me
    you of your wife and me of my consent
    of my consent that she should be your wife <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  my lord fair helen told me of their stealth
    of this their purpose hither to this wood
    and i in fury hither followed them
    fair helena in fancy following me <SENTENCE-END>   
    but my good lord i wot not by what power
    but by some power it is my love to hermia
    melted as the snow seems to me now
    as the remembrance of an idle gaud
    which in my childhood i did dote upon
    and all the faith the virtue of my heart
    the object and the pleasure of mine eye
    is only helena <SENTENCE-END>  to her my lord
    was i betrothd ere i saw hermia <SENTENCE-END> 
    but like a sickness did i loathe this food
    but as in health come to my natural taste
    now i do wish it love it long for it
    and will for evermore be true to it <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  fair lovers you are fortunately met
    of this discourse we more will hear anon <SENTENCE-END> 
    egeus i will overbear your will
    for in the temple by and by with us

    and for the morning now is something worn

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
athens <SENTENCE-END>  the palace of theseus

enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and attendants

  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  more strange than true <SENTENCE-END>  i never may believe
    these antique fables nor these fairy toys <SENTENCE-END> 
    lovers and madmen have such seething brains
    such shaping fantasies that apprehend
    more than cool reason ever comprehends <SENTENCE-END> 
    the lunatic the lover and the poet
    are of imagination all compact <SENTENCE-END> 
    one sees more devils than vast hell can hold
    that is the madman <SENTENCE-END>  the lover all as frantic
    sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt <SENTENCE-END> 
    the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling
    doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
    and as imagination bodies forth
    the forms of things unknown the poets pen
    turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing  
    a local habitation and a name <SENTENCE-END> 
    such tricks hath strong imagination
    that if it would but apprehend some joy
    it comprehends some bringer of that joy
    or in the night imagining some fear
    how easy is a bush supposd a bear
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  but all the story of the night told over
    and all their minds transfigurd so together
    more witnesseth than fancys images
    and grows to something of great constancy
    but howsoever strange and admirable <SENTENCE-END> 

          enter lysander demetrius hermia and helena

  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  here come the lovers full of joy and mirth <SENTENCE-END> 
    joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
    accompany your hearts
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  more than to us
    wait in your royal walks your board your bed
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  come now what masques what dances shall we have  
    to wear away this long age of three hours
    between our aftersupper and bedtime
    where is our usual manager of mirth
    what revels are in hand is there no play
    to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
    call philostrate <SENTENCE-END> 
  philostrate <SENTENCE-END>  here mighty theseus <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  say what abridgment have you for this evening
    what masque what music how shall we beguile
    the lazy time if not with some delight
  philostrate <SENTENCE-END>  there is a brief how many sports are ripe
    make choice of which your highness will see first <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                giving a paper
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  the battle with the centaurs to be sung
    by an athenian eunuch to the harp <SENTENCE-END> 
    well none of that that have i told my love
    in glory of my kinsman hercules <SENTENCE-END> 
    the riot of the tipsy bacchanals
    tearing the thracian singer in their rage <SENTENCE-END> 
    that is an old device and it was playd  
    when i from thebes came last a conqueror <SENTENCE-END> 
    the thrice three muses mourning for the death
    of learning late deceasd in beggary <SENTENCE-END> 
    that is some satire keen and critical
    not sorting with a nuptial ceremony <SENTENCE-END> 
    a tedious brief scene of young pyramus
    and his love thisby very tragical mirth <SENTENCE-END> 
    merry and tragical tedious and brief
    that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow <SENTENCE-END> 
    how shall we find the concord of this discord
  philostrate <SENTENCE-END>  a play there is my lord some ten words long
    which is as brief as i have known a play
    but by ten words my lord it is too long
    which makes it tedious for in all the play
    there is not one word apt one player fitted <SENTENCE-END> 
    and tragical my noble lord it is
    for pyramus therein doth kill himself <SENTENCE-END> 
    which when i saw rehearsd i must confess
    made mine eyes water but more merry tears
    the passion of loud laughter never shed <SENTENCE-END>   
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  what are they that do play it
  philostrate <SENTENCE-END>  hardhanded men that work in athens here
    which never labourd in their minds till now
    and now have toild their unbreathed memories
    with this same play against your nuptial <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  and we will hear it <SENTENCE-END> 
  philostrate <SENTENCE-END>  no my noble lord
    it is not for you <SENTENCE-END>  i have heard it over
    and it is nothing nothing in the world
    unless you can find sport in their intents
    extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain
    to do you service <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  i will hear that play
    for never anything can be amiss
    when simpleness and duty tender it <SENTENCE-END> 
    go bring them in and take your places ladies <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                exit philostrate
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  i love not to see wretchedness oercharged
    and duty in his service perishing <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing <SENTENCE-END>   
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  he says they can do nothing in this kind <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
    our sport shall be to take what they mistake
    and what poor duty cannot do noble respect
    takes it in might not merit <SENTENCE-END> 
    where i have come great clerks have purposed
    to greet me with premeditated welcomes
    where i have seen them shiver and look pale
    make periods in the midst of sentences
    throttle their practisd accent in their fears
    and in conclusion dumbly have broke off
    not paying me a welcome <SENTENCE-END>  trust me sweet
    out of this silence yet i pickd a welcome
    and in the modesty of fearful duty
    i read as much as from the rattling tongue
    of saucy and audacious eloquence <SENTENCE-END> 
    love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
    in least speak most to my capacity <SENTENCE-END> 

                       reenter philostrate  

  philostrate <SENTENCE-END>  so please your grace the prologue is addressd <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  let him approach <SENTENCE-END>               flourish of trumpets

                 enter quince as the prologue

  prologue <SENTENCE-END>  if we offend it is with our good will <SENTENCE-END> 
    that you should think we come not to offend
    but with good will <SENTENCE-END>  to show our simple skill
    that is the true beginning of our end <SENTENCE-END> 
    consider then we come but in despite <SENTENCE-END> 
    we do not come as minding to content you
    our true intent is <SENTENCE-END>  all for your delight
    we are not here <SENTENCE-END>  that you should here repent you
    the actors are at band and by their show
    you shall know all that you are like to know
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  this fellow doth not stand upon points <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not
    the stop <SENTENCE-END>  a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but
    to speak true <SENTENCE-END>   
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  indeed he hath playd on this prologue like a child on a
    recorder a sound but not in government <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  his speech was like a tangled chain nothing im paired
    but all disordered <SENTENCE-END>  who is next

          enter with a trumpet before them as in dumb show
            pyramus and thisby wall moonshine and lion

  prologue <SENTENCE-END>  gentles perchance you wonder at this show
    but wonder on till truth make all things plain <SENTENCE-END> 
    this man is pyramus if you would know
    this beauteous lady thisby is certain <SENTENCE-END> 
    this man with lime and roughcast doth present
    wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder
    and through walls chink poor souls they are content
    to whisper <SENTENCE-END>  at the which let no man wonder <SENTENCE-END> 
    this man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
    presenteth moonshine for if you will know
    by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    to meet at ninus tomb there there to woo <SENTENCE-END>   
    this grisly beast which lion hight by name
    the trusty thisby coming first by night
    did scare away or rather did affright
    and as she fled her mantle she did fall
    which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain <SENTENCE-END> 
    anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall
    and finds his trusty thisbys mantle slain
    whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
    he bravely broachd his boiling bloody breast
    and thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
    his dagger drew and died <SENTENCE-END>  for all the rest
    let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain
    at large discourse while here they do remain <SENTENCE-END> 
                               exeunt prologue pyramus thisby
                                             lion and moonshine
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  i wonder if the lion be to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do <SENTENCE-END> 
  wall <SENTENCE-END>  in this same interlude it doth befall
    that i one snout by name present a wall
    and such a wall as i would have you think  
    that had in it a crannied hole or chink
    through which the lovers pyramus and thisby
    did whisper often very secretly <SENTENCE-END> 
    this loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
    that i am that same wall the truth is so
    and this the cranny is right and sinister
    through which the fearful lovers are to whisper <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  would you desire lime and hair to speak better
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard
    discourse my lord <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter pyramus

  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  pyramus draws near the wall silence <SENTENCE-END>

    but what see what see i no thisby do i see <SENTENCE-END> 
    o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss
    cursd he thy stones for thus deceiving me
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  the wall methinks being sensible should curse again <SENTENCE-END> 
  pyramus <SENTENCE-END>  no in truth sir he should not <SENTENCE-END>  deceiving me is thisbys
    cue <SENTENCE-END>  she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall <SENTENCE-END> 
    you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes <SENTENCE-END>

    the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
    may now perchance both quake and tremble here
    when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar <SENTENCE-END> 
    then know that i as snug the joiner am
    a lion fell nor else no lions dam
    for if i should as lion come in strife
    into this place twere pity on my life <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  a very gentle beast and of a good conscience <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  the very best at a beast my lord that eer i saw <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  this lion is a very fox for his valour <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  true and a goose for his discretion <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his  
    discretion and the fox carries the goose <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for
    the goose carries not the fox <SENTENCE-END>  it is well <SENTENCE-END>  leave it to his
    discretion and let us listen to the moon <SENTENCE-END> 
  moonshine <SENTENCE-END>  this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  he should have worn the horns on his head <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the
    circumference <SENTENCE-END> 
  moonshine <SENTENCE-END>  this lanthorn doth the horned moon present
    myself the man i th moon do seem to be <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should
    be put into the lantern <SENTENCE-END>  how is it else the man i th moon
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  he dares not come there for the candle for you see it
    is already in snuff <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  i am aweary of this moon <SENTENCE-END>  would he would change
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  it appears by his small light of discretion that he is
    in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay
    the time <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  proceed moon <SENTENCE-END> 
  moon <SENTENCE-END>  all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is  
    the moon i the man i th moon this thornbush my thornbush
    and this dog my dog <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  why all these should be in the lantern for all these
    are in the moon <SENTENCE-END>  but silence here comes thisby <SENTENCE-END> 

                        reenter thisby

  thisby <SENTENCE-END>  this is old ninnys tomb <SENTENCE-END>  where is my love
  lion <SENTENCE-END>  roaring o                           thisby runs off
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  well roard lion <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  well run thisby <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  well shone moon <SENTENCE-END>  truly the moon shines with a good
    grace <SENTENCE-END>             the lion tears thisbys mantle and exit
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  well mousd lion <SENTENCE-END> 

                        reenter pyramus

  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  and then came pyramus <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  and so the lion vanishd <SENTENCE-END> 
  pyramus <SENTENCE-END>  sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams  
    i thank thee moon for shining now so bright
    for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
    i trust to take of truest thisby sight <SENTENCE-END> 
             but stay o spite
             but mark poor knight
           what dreadful dole is here
             eyes do you see
             how can it he
           o dainty duck o dear
             thy mantle good
             what staind with blood
           approach ye furies fell <SENTENCE-END> 
             o fates come come
             cut thread and thrum
           quail crush conclude and quell <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  this passion and the death of a dear friend would go
    near to make a man look sad <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  beshrew my heart but i pity the man <SENTENCE-END> 
  pyramus <SENTENCE-END>  o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame
    since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear  
    which is no no which was the fairest dame
    that livd that lovd that likd that lookd with cheer <SENTENCE-END> 
             come tears confound
             out sword and wound
           the pap of pyramus
             ay that left pap
             where heart doth hop <SENTENCE-END>                stabs himself
           thus die i thus thus thus <SENTENCE-END> 
             now am i dead
             now am i fled
           my soul is in the sky <SENTENCE-END> 
             tongue lose thy light
             moon take thy flight <SENTENCE-END>              exit moonshine
           now die die die die die <SENTENCE-END>                    dies
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  no die but an ace for him for he is but one <SENTENCE-END> 
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet
    prove an ass <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  how chance moonshine is gone before thisby comes back
    and finds her lover  

                       reenter thisby

  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  she will find him by starlight <SENTENCE-END>  here she comes and her
    passion ends the play <SENTENCE-END> 
  hippolyta <SENTENCE-END>  methinks she should not use a long one for such a
    pyramus i hope she will be brief <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which
    thisby is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a
    woman god bless us
  lysander <SENTENCE-END>  she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  and thus she moans videlicet
  thisby <SENTENCE-END>       asleep my love
               what dead my dove
             o pyramus arise
               speak speak <SENTENCE-END>  quite dumb
               dead dead a tomb
             must cover thy sweet eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
               these lily lips
               this cherry nose  
             these yellow cowslip cheeks
               are gone are gone
               lovers make moan
             his eyes were green as leeks <SENTENCE-END> 
               o sisters three
               come come to me
             with hands as pale as milk
               lay them in gore
               since you have shore
             with shears his thread of silk <SENTENCE-END>

  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  ay and wall too <SENTENCE-END> 
  bottom <SENTENCE-END>  starting up no i assure you the wall is down that
    parted their fathers <SENTENCE-END>  will it please you to see the epilogue or  
    to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company
  theseus <SENTENCE-END>  no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse <SENTENCE-END> 
    never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none
    to be blamed <SENTENCE-END>  marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and
    hangd himself in thisbys garter it would have been a fine
    tragedy <SENTENCE-END>  and so it is truly and very notably dischargd <SENTENCE-END>  but
    come your bergomask let your epilogue alone <SENTENCE-END>      a dance
    the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve <SENTENCE-END> 
    lovers to bed tis almost fairy time <SENTENCE-END> 
    i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
    as much as we this night have overwatchd <SENTENCE-END> 
    this palpablegross play hath well beguild
    the heavy gait of night <SENTENCE-END>  sweet friends to bed <SENTENCE-END> 
    a fortnight hold we this solemnity
    in nightly revels and new jollity <SENTENCE-END>                     exeunt

                     enter puck with a broom

  puck <SENTENCE-END>       now the hungry lion roars
             and the wolf behowls the moon  
             whilst the heavy ploughman snores
             all with weary task fordone <SENTENCE-END> 
             now the wasted brands do glow
             whilst the screechowl screeching loud
             puts the wretch that lies in woe
             in remembrance of a shroud <SENTENCE-END> 
             now it is the time of night
             that the graves all gaping wide
             every one lets forth his sprite
             in the churchway paths to glide <SENTENCE-END> 
             and we fairies that do run
             by the triple hecates team
             from the presence of the sun
             following darkness like a dream
             now are frolic <SENTENCE-END>  not a mouse
             shall disturb this hallowed house <SENTENCE-END> 
             i am sent with broom before
             to sweep the dust behind the door <SENTENCE-END> 

         enter oberon and titania with all their train  

  oberon <SENTENCE-END>     through the house give glimmering light
             by the dead and drowsy fire
             every elf and fairy sprite
             hop as light as bird from brier
             and this ditty after me
             sing and dance it trippingly <SENTENCE-END> 
  titania <SENTENCE-END>       first rehearse your song by rote
                to each word a warbling note
                hand in hand with fairy grace
                will we sing and bless this place <SENTENCE-END> 

           oberon leading the fairies sing and dance

  oberon <SENTENCE-END>     now until the break of day
             through this house each fairy stray <SENTENCE-END> 
             to the best bridebed will we
             which by us shall blessed be
             and the issue there create
             ever shall be fortunate <SENTENCE-END>   
             so shall all the couples three
             ever true in loving be
             and the blots of natures hand
             shall not in their issue stand
             never mole harelip nor scar
             nor mark prodigious such as are
             despised in nativity
             shall upon their children be <SENTENCE-END> 
             with this fielddew consecrate
             every fairy take his gait
             and each several chamber bless
             through this palace with sweet peace
             and the owner of it blest
             ever shall in safety rest <SENTENCE-END> 
             trip away make no stay
             meet me all by break of day <SENTENCE-END>     exeunt all but puck
  puck <SENTENCE-END>       if we shadows have offended
             think but this and all is mended
             that you have but slumbred here
             while these visions did appear <SENTENCE-END>   
             and this weak and idle theme
             no more yielding but a dream
             gentles do not reprehend <SENTENCE-END> 
             if you pardon we will mend <SENTENCE-END> 
             and as i am an honest puck
             if we have unearned luck
             now to scape the serpents tongue
             we will make amends ere long
             else the puck a liar call <SENTENCE-END> 
             so good night unto you all <SENTENCE-END> 
             give me your hands if we be friends
             and robin shall restore amends <SENTENCE-END>                 exit

an orchard before leonatos house <SENTENCE-END> 

enter leonato governor of messina hero his daughter
and beatrice his niece with a messenger <SENTENCE-END> 

  leon <SENTENCE-END>  i learn in this letter that don pedro of arragon comes this
    night to messina <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  he is very near by this <SENTENCE-END>  he was not three leagues off when i
    left him <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  how many gentlemen have you lost in this action
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  but few of any sort and none of name <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
    numbers <SENTENCE-END>  i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honour on
    a young florentine called claudio <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  much deservd on his part and equally remembred by don
    pedro <SENTENCE-END>  he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing
    in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion <SENTENCE-END>  he hath indeed
    better bettred expectation than you must expect of me to tell
    you how <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  i have already delivered him letters and there appears much  
    joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest
    enough without a badge of bitterness <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  did he break out into tears
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  in great measure <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  a kind overflow of kindness <SENTENCE-END>  there are no faces truer than
    those that are so washd <SENTENCE-END>  how much better is it to weep at joy
    than to joy at weeping
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you is signior mountanto returnd from the wars or no
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  i know none of that name lady <SENTENCE-END>  there was none such in the
    army of any sort <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  what is he that you ask for niece
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  my cousin means signior benedick of padua <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  o hes returnd and as pleasant as ever he was <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  he set up his bills here in messina and challengd cupid at
    the flight and my uncles fool reading the challenge
    subscribd for cupid and challengd him at the burbolt <SENTENCE-END>  i pray
    you how many hath he killd and eaten in these wars but how
    many hath he killd for indeed i promised to eat all of his
    killing <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but hell  
    be meet with you i doubt it not <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  he hath done good service lady in these wars <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it <SENTENCE-END>  he is a
    very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  and a good soldier too lady <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffd with all honourable
    virtues <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  it is so indeed <SENTENCE-END>  he is no less than a stuffd man but for
    the stuffingwell we are all mortal <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  you must not sir mistake my niece <SENTENCE-END>  there is a kind of merry
    war betwixt signior benedick and her <SENTENCE-END>  they never meet but theres
    a skirmish of wit between them <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  alas he gets nothing by that in our last conflict four of
    his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governd
    with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let
    him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for
    it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
    creature <SENTENCE-END>  who is his companion now he hath every month a new
    sworn brother <SENTENCE-END>   
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  ist possible
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  very easily possible <SENTENCE-END>  he wears his faith but as the fashion
    of his hat it ever changes with the next block <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  i see lady the gentleman is not in your books <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END>  an he were i would burn my study <SENTENCE-END>  but i pray you who is
    his companion is there no young squarer now that will make a
    voyage with him to the devil
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  he is most in the company of the right noble claudio <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner
    caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad <SENTENCE-END>  god
    help the noble claudio if he have caught the benedick it will
    cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  i will hold friends with you lady <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  do good friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  you will never run mad niece <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  no not till a hot january <SENTENCE-END> 
  mess <SENTENCE-END>  don pedro is approachd <SENTENCE-END> 

  enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar and john the bastard <SENTENCE-END> 
  
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  good signior leonato are you come to meet your trouble the
    fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace
    for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart
    from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  you embrace your charge too willingly <SENTENCE-END>  i think this is your
    daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  her mother hath many times told me so <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  were you in doubt sir that you askd her
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  signior benedick no for then were you a child <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  you have it full benedick <SENTENCE-END>  we may guess by this what you
    are being a man <SENTENCE-END>  truly the lady fathers herself <SENTENCE-END>  be happy lady
    for you are like an honourable father <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head
    on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick <SENTENCE-END> 
    nobody marks you <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  what my dear lady disdain are you yet living
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet
    food to feed it as signior benedick courtesy itself must convert  
    to disdain if you come in her presence <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  then is courtesy a turncoat <SENTENCE-END>  but it is certain i am loved of
    all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my
    heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled
    with a pernicious suitor <SENTENCE-END>  i thank god and my cold blood i am of
    your humour for that <SENTENCE-END>  i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
    than a man swear he loves me <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman
    or other shall scape a predestinate scratchd face <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as
    yours were <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  well you are a rare parrotteacher <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a
    continuer <SENTENCE-END>  but keep your way a gods name i have done <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  you always end with a jades trick <SENTENCE-END>  i know you of old <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  that is the sum of all leonato <SENTENCE-END>  signior claudio and signior

    season for your own harvest <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace

    be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but
    i am a plaindealing villain <SENTENCE-END>  i am trusted with a muzzle and

a hall in leonatos house <SENTENCE-END> 

enter leonato antonio his brother hero his daughter
and beatrice his niece and a kinsman also margaret and ursula <SENTENCE-END> 

  leon <SENTENCE-END>  was not count john here at supper
  ant <SENTENCE-END>  i saw him not <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am
    heartburnd an hour after <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  he is of a very melancholy disposition <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
    between him and benedick <SENTENCE-END>  the one is too like an image and says
    nothing and the other too like my ladys eldest son evermore
    tattling <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  then half signior benedicks tongue in count johns mouth
    and half count johns melancholy in signior benedicks face
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in
    his purse such a man would win any woman in the worldif a
    could get her good will <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if
    thou be so shrewd of thy tongue <SENTENCE-END>   
  ant <SENTENCE-END>  in faith shes too curst <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  too curst is more than curst <SENTENCE-END>  i shall lessen gods sending
    that way for it is said god sends a curst cow short horns
    but to a cow too curst he sends none <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  so by being too curst god will send you no horns <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am
    at him upon my knees every morning and evening <SENTENCE-END>  lord i could not
    endure a husband with a beard on his face <SENTENCE-END>  i had rather lie in
    the woollen
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  you may light on a husband that hath no beard <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  what should i do with him dress him in my apparel and make
    him my waiting gentlewoman he that hath a beard is more than a
    youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that
    is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
    man i am not for him <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i will even take sixpence in
    earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  well then go you into hell
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an
    old cuckold with horns on his head and say get you to heaven
    beatrice get you to heaven <SENTENCE-END>  heres no place for you maids <SENTENCE-END>  so  
    deliver i up my apes and away to saint peterfor the heavens <SENTENCE-END> 
    he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry
    as the day is long <SENTENCE-END> 
  ant <SENTENCE-END>  to hero well niece i trust you will be ruld by your
    father <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  yes faith <SENTENCE-END>  it is my cousins duty to make cursy and say
    father as it please you <SENTENCE-END>  but yet for all that cousin let him
    be a handsome fellow or else make another cursy and say
    father as it please me <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  not till god make men of some other metal than earth <SENTENCE-END>  would
    it not grieve a woman to be overmasterd with a piece of valiant
    dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
    no uncle ill none <SENTENCE-END>  adams sons are my brethren and truly i
    hold it a sin to match in my kinred <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  daughter remember what i told you <SENTENCE-END>  if the prince do solicit
    you in that kind you know your answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed
    in good time <SENTENCE-END>  if the prince be too important tell him there is
    measure in everything and so dance out the answer <SENTENCE-END>  for hear me  
    hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a
    measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like
    a scotch jigand full as fantastical the wedding mannerly
    modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
    repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace
    faster and faster till he sink into his grave <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  the revellers are entring brother <SENTENCE-END>  make good room <SENTENCE-END>

  bora <SENTENCE-END>  yea my lord but i can cross it <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  any bar any cross any impediment will be medcinable to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his
    affection ranges evenly with mine <SENTENCE-END>  how canst thou cross this
    marriage
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty
    shall appear in me <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  show me briefly how <SENTENCE-END> 
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in
    the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  i remember <SENTENCE-END> 
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her
    to look out at her ladys chamber window <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  the poison of that lies in you to temper <SENTENCE-END>  go you to the  
    prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
    his honour in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do
    you mightily hold up to a contaminated stale such a one as
    hero <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  what proof shall i make of that
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo
    hero and kill leonato <SENTENCE-END>  look you for any other issue
  john <SENTENCE-END>  only to despite them i will endeavour anything <SENTENCE-END> 
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count
    claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend
    a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio asin love of
    your brothers honour who hath made this match and his friends
    reputation who is thus like to be cozend with the semblance of
    a maidthat you have discoverd thus <SENTENCE-END>  they will scarcely believe
    this without trial <SENTENCE-END>  offer them instances which shall bear no
    less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me
    call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them
    to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in
    the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be
    absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of heros  
    disloyalty that jealousy shall be calld assurance and all the
    preparation overthrown <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in
    practice <SENTENCE-END>  be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a
    thousand ducats <SENTENCE-END> 
  bora <SENTENCE-END>  be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not
    shame me <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  i will presently go learn their day of marriage <SENTENCE-END>

  bene <SENTENCE-END>  i know that but i would have thee hence and here again <SENTENCE-END> 
    exit boy <SENTENCE-END>  i do much wonder that one man seeing how much
    another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love
    will after he hath laughd at such shallow follies in others
    become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such
    a man is claudio <SENTENCE-END>  i have known when there was no music with him
    but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor
    and the pipe <SENTENCE-END>  i have known when he would have walkd ten mile
    afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake  
    carving the fashion of a new doublet <SENTENCE-END>  he was wont to speak plain
    and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is
    he turnd orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet
    just so many strange dishes <SENTENCE-END>  may i be so converted and see with
    these eyes i cannot tell i think not <SENTENCE-END>  i will not be sworn but
    love may transform me to an oyster but ill take my oath on it
    till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a
    fool <SENTENCE-END>  one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am
    well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in

    be thats certain wise or ill none virtuous or ill never
    cheapen her fair or ill never look on her mild or come not

    excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it
    please god <SENTENCE-END>  ha the prince and monsieur love i will hide me in
    the arbour <SENTENCE-END>                                          hides <SENTENCE-END>

  leon <SENTENCE-END>  no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote
    on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours
    seemd ever to abhor <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  aside ist possible sits the wind in that corner
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but
    that she loves him with an enraged affection <SENTENCE-END>  it is past the
    infinite of thought <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  may be she doth but counterfeit <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  faith like enough <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  o god counterfeit there was never counterfeit of passion
    came so near the life of passion as she discovers it <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  why what effects of passion shows she
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  aside bait the hook well this fish will bite <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  what effects my lord she will sit youyou heard my
    daughter tell you how <SENTENCE-END>   
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  she did indeed <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  how how i pray you you amaze me <SENTENCE-END>  i would have thought her
    spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  i would have sworn it had my lordespecially against
    benedick <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  aside i should think this a gull but that the whitebearded
    fellow speaks it <SENTENCE-END>  knavery cannot sure hide himself in such
    reverence <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  aside he hath taen th infection <SENTENCE-END>  hold it up <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  hath she made her affection known to benedick
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  no and swears she never will <SENTENCE-END>  thats her torment <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  tis true indeed <SENTENCE-END>  so your daughter says <SENTENCE-END>  shall i says
    she that have so oft encountred him with scorn write to him
    that i love him
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for
    shell be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her
    smock till she have writ a sheet of paper <SENTENCE-END>  my daughter tells us
    all <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest
    your daughter told us of <SENTENCE-END>   
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  o when she had writ it and was reading it over she found
    benedick and beatrice between the sheet
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  that <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence raild at
    herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
    knew would flout her <SENTENCE-END>  i measure him says she by my own
    spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me <SENTENCE-END>  yea though i
    love him i should <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her
    heart tears her hair prays curseso sweet benedick god give
    me patience
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  she doth indeed my daughter says so <SENTENCE-END>  and the ecstasy hath so
    much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will
    do a desperate outrage to herself <SENTENCE-END>  it is very true <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she
    will not discover it <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  to what end he would make but a sport of it and torment the
    poor lady worse <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  an he should it were an alms to hang him shes an
    excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous <SENTENCE-END>   
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  and she is exceeding wise <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  in everything but in loving benedick <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  o my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body
    we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory <SENTENCE-END>  i am sorry
    for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  i would she had bestowed this dotage on me <SENTENCE-END>  i would have
    daffd all other respects and made her half myself <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you
    tell benedick of it and hear what a will say <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  were it good think you
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die
    if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known
    and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one
    breath of her accustomed crossness <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  she doth well <SENTENCE-END>  if she should make tender of her love tis
    very possible hell scorn it for the man as you know all hath
    a contemptible spirit <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  he is a very proper man <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  he hath indeed a good outward happiness <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  before god and in my mind very wise <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit <SENTENCE-END>   
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  and i take him to be valiant <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you
    may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great
    discretion or undertakes them with a most christianlike fear <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  if he do fear god a must necessarily keep peace <SENTENCE-END>  if he
    break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
    trembling <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it
    seems not in him by some large jests he will make <SENTENCE-END>  well i am
    sorry for your niece <SENTENCE-END>  shall we go seek benedick and tell him of
    her love
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  never tell him my lord <SENTENCE-END>  let her wear it out with good
    counsel <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  nay thats impossible she may wear her heart out first <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  well we will hear further of it by your daughter <SENTENCE-END>  let it
    cool the while <SENTENCE-END>  i love benedick well and i could wish he would
    modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a
    lady <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  my lord will you  <SENTENCE-END> walk dinner is ready <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               they walk away <SENTENCE-END>   
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  if he dote on her upon this i will never trust my
    expectation <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  let there be the same net spread for her and that must your
    daughter and her gentlewomen carry <SENTENCE-END>  the sport will be when they
    hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter <SENTENCE-END> 
    thats the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb
    show <SENTENCE-END>  let us send her to call him in to dinner <SENTENCE-END> 
                       exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato <SENTENCE-END> 

                benedick advances from the arbour <SENTENCE-END> 

  bene <SENTENCE-END>  this can be no trick <SENTENCE-END>  the conference was sadly borne they
    have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady <SENTENCE-END> 
    it seems her affections have their full bent <SENTENCE-END>  love me why it
    must be requited <SENTENCE-END>  i hear how i am censurd <SENTENCE-END>  they say i will bear
    myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her <SENTENCE-END>  they say too
    that she will rather die than give any sign of affection <SENTENCE-END>  i did
    never think to marry <SENTENCE-END>  i must not seem proud <SENTENCE-END>  happy are they that
    hear their detractions and can put them to mending <SENTENCE-END>  they say the
    lady is fairtis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous  
    tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving meby
    my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of
    her folly for i will be horribly in love with her <SENTENCE-END>  i may chance
    have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i
    have railed so long against marriage <SENTENCE-END>  but doth not the appetite
    alters a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure
    in his age <SENTENCE-END>  shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
    the brain awe a man from the career of his humour no the world
    must be peopled <SENTENCE-END>  when i said i would die a bachelor i did not
    think i should live till i were married <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter beatrice <SENTENCE-END> 

    here comes beatrice <SENTENCE-END>  by this day shes a fair lady i do spy
    some marks of love in her <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  fair beatrice i thank you for your pains <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
    thank me <SENTENCE-END>  if it had been painful i would not have come <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  you take pleasure then in the message  
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and
    choke a daw withal <SENTENCE-END>  you have no stomach signior <SENTENCE-END>  fare you well <SENTENCE-END> 
exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  ha against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner <SENTENCE-END> 
    theres a double meaning in that <SENTENCE-END>  i took no more pains for those
    thanks than you took pains to thank me <SENTENCE-END>  thats as much as to
    say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks <SENTENCE-END>  if i
    do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i
    am a jew <SENTENCE-END>  i will go get her picture <SENTENCE-END>                    exit <SENTENCE-END>

act iii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
leonatos orchard <SENTENCE-END> 

enter hero and two gentlewomen margaret and ursula <SENTENCE-END> 

  hero <SENTENCE-END>  good margaret run thee to the parlour <SENTENCE-END> 
    there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice
    proposing with the prince and claudio <SENTENCE-END> 
    whisper her ear and tell her i and ursley
    walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
    is all of her <SENTENCE-END>  say that thou overheardst us
    and bid her steal into the pleached bower
    where honeysuckles ripened by the sun
    forbid the sun to enterlike favourites
    made proud by princes that advance their pride
    against that power that bred it <SENTENCE-END>  there will she hide her
    to listen our propose <SENTENCE-END>  this is thy office <SENTENCE-END> 
    bear thee well in it and leave us alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  marg <SENTENCE-END>  ill make her come i warrant you presently <SENTENCE-END>     exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  now ursula when beatrice doth come
    as we do trace this alley up and down
    our talk must only be of benedick <SENTENCE-END>   
    when i do name him let it be thy part
    to praise him more than ever man did merit <SENTENCE-END> 
    my talk to thee must be how benedick
    is sick in love with beatrice <SENTENCE-END>  of this matter
    is little cupids crafty arrow made
    that only wounds by hearsay <SENTENCE-END> 

                   enter beatrice <SENTENCE-END> 

    now begin
    for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs
    close by the ground to hear our conference <SENTENCE-END> 

               beatrice hides in the arbour <SENTENCE-END> 

  urs <SENTENCE-END>  the pleasantst angling is to see the fish
    cut with her golden oars the silver stream
    and greedily devour the treacherous bait <SENTENCE-END> 
    so angle we for beatrice who even now
    is couched in the woodbine coverture <SENTENCE-END>   
    fear you not my part of the dialogue <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
    of the false sweet bait that we lay for it <SENTENCE-END> 
                                     they approach the arbour <SENTENCE-END> 
    no truly ursula she is too disdainful <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know her spirits are as coy and wild
    as haggards of the rock <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  but are you sure
    that benedick loves beatrice so entirely
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  so says the prince and my newtrothed lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  and did they bid you tell her of it madam
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  they did entreat me to acquaint her of it
    but i persuaded them if they lovd benedick
    to wish him wrestle with affection
    and never to let beatrice know of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  why did you so doth not the gentleman
    deserve as full as fortunate a bed
    as ever beatrice shall couch upon
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  o god of love i know he doth deserve
    as much as may be yielded to a man  
    but nature never framd a womans heart
    of prouder stuff than that of beatrice <SENTENCE-END> 
    disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
    misprizing what they look on and her wit
    values itself so highly that to her
    all matter else seems weak <SENTENCE-END>  she cannot love
    nor take no shape nor project of affection
    she is so selfendeared <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  sure i think so
    and therefore certainly it were not good
    she knew his love lest shell make sport at it <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  why you speak truth <SENTENCE-END>  i never yet saw man
    how wise how noble young how rarely featurd
    but she would spell him backward <SENTENCE-END>  if fairfacd
    she would swear the gentleman should be her sister
    if black why nature drawing of an antic
    made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded
    if low an agate very vilely cut
    if speaking why a vane blown with all winds
    if silent why a block moved with none <SENTENCE-END>   
    so turns she every man the wrong side out
    and never gives to truth and virtue that
    which simpleness and merit purchaseth <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  sure sure such carping is not commendable <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  no not to be so odd and from all fashions
    as beatrice is cannot be commendable <SENTENCE-END> 
    but who dare tell her so if i should speak
    she would mock me into air o she would laugh me
    out of myself press me to death with wit
    therefore let benedick like coverd fire
    consume away in sighs waste inwardly <SENTENCE-END> 
    it were a better death than die with mocks
    which is as bad as die with tickling <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  yet tell her of it <SENTENCE-END>  hear what she will say <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  no rather i will go to benedick
    and counsel him to fight against his passion <SENTENCE-END> 
    and truly ill devise some honest slanders
    to stain my cousin with <SENTENCE-END>  one doth not know
    how much an ill word may empoison liking <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  o do not do your cousin such a wrong  
    she cannot be so much without true judgment
    having so swift and excellent a wit
    as she is prizd to have as to refuse
    so rare a gentleman as signior benedick <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  he is the only man of italy
    always excepted my dear claudio <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you be not angry with me madam
    speaking my fancy signior benedick
    for shape for bearing argument and valour
    goes foremost in report through italy <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  indeed he hath an excellent good name <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  his excellence did earn it ere he had it <SENTENCE-END> 
    when are you married madam
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  why every day tomorrow come go in <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill show thee some attires and have thy counsel
    which is the best to furnish me tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               they walk away <SENTENCE-END> 
  urs <SENTENCE-END>  shes limd i warrant you we have caught her madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  if it prove so then loving goes by haps
    some cupid kills with arrows some with traps <SENTENCE-END>   
                                       exeunt hero and ursula <SENTENCE-END> 

    beatrice advances from the arbour <SENTENCE-END> 

  beat <SENTENCE-END>  what fire is in mine ears can this be true
    stand i condemnd for pride and scorn so much
    contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
    no glory lives behind the back of such <SENTENCE-END> 
    and benedick love on i will requite thee
    taming my wild heart to thy loving hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
    to bind our loves up in a holy band
    for others say thou dost deserve and i
    believe it better than reportingly <SENTENCE-END>                     exit <SENTENCE-END>

    i toward arragon <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  ill bring you thither my lord if youll vouchsafe me <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
    marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear
    it <SENTENCE-END>  i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from
    the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth <SENTENCE-END> 
    he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little
    hangman dare not shoot at him <SENTENCE-END>  he hath a heart as sound as a
    bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks
    his tongue speaks <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  gallants i am not as i have been <SENTENCE-END>

  bene <SENTENCE-END>  well every one can master a grief but he that has it <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  yet say i he is in love <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy
    that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a
    frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as
    a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from
    the hip upward no doublet <SENTENCE-END>  unless he have a fancy to this
    foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you
    would have it appear he is <SENTENCE-END>

  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  nay a rubs himself with civet <SENTENCE-END>  can you smell him out by
    that
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  thats as much as to say the sweet youths in love <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  the greatest note of it is his melancholy <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  and when was he wont to wash his face
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  yea or to paint himself for the which i hear what they say
    of him <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  nay but his jesting spirit which is newcrept into a
    lutestring and now governd by stops <SENTENCE-END> 
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  indeed that tells a heavy tale for him <SENTENCE-END>  conclude conclude

scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
a street <SENTENCE-END> 

enter dogberry and his compartner verges with the watch <SENTENCE-END> 

  dog <SENTENCE-END>  are you good men and true
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation
    body and soul <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should
    have any allegiance in them being chosen for the princes watch <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  well give them their charge neighbour dogberry <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  first who think you the most desartless man to be constable
  1 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  hugh oatcake sir or george seacoal for they can write
    and read <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  come hither neighbour seacoal <SENTENCE-END>  god hath blessd you with a
    good name <SENTENCE-END>  to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but
    to write and read comes by nature <SENTENCE-END> 
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  both which master constable
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  you have <SENTENCE-END>  i knew it would be your answer <SENTENCE-END>  well for your
    favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and
    for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no
    need of such vanity <SENTENCE-END>  you are thought here to be the most  
    senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch <SENTENCE-END>  therefore
    bear you the lanthorn <SENTENCE-END>  this is your charge you shall comprehend
    all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes
    name <SENTENCE-END> 
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  how if a will not stand
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  why then take no note of him but let him go and presently
    call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of
    a knave <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the
    princes subjects <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  true and they are to meddle with none but the princes
    subjects <SENTENCE-END>  you shall also make no noise in the streets for for
    the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be
    endured <SENTENCE-END> 
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  we will rather sleep than talk <SENTENCE-END>  we know what belongs to
    a watch <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i
    cannot see how sleeping should offend <SENTENCE-END>  only have a care that your
    bills be not stoln <SENTENCE-END>  well you are to call at all the alehouses
    and bid those that are drunk get them to bed <SENTENCE-END>   
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  how if they will not
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  why then let them alone till they are sober <SENTENCE-END>  if they make you
    not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you
    took them for <SENTENCE-END> 
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  well sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your
    office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you
    meddle or make with them why the more your honesty <SENTENCE-END> 
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on
    him
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  truly by your office you may but i think they that touch
    pitch will be defild <SENTENCE-END>  the most peaceable way for you if you do
    take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal
    out of your company <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  you have been always called a merciful man partner <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who
    hath any honesty in him <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the
    nurse and bid her still it <SENTENCE-END> 
  2 <SENTENCE-END>  watch <SENTENCE-END>  how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us  
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with
    crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will
    never answer a calf when he bleats <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  tis very true <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  this is the end of the charge you constable are to present
    the princes own person <SENTENCE-END>  if you meet the prince in the night
    you may stay him <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  nay byr lady that i think a cannot <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  five shillings to one ont with any man that knows the
    statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be
    willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is
    an offence to stay a man against his will <SENTENCE-END> 
  verg <SENTENCE-END>  byr lady i think it be so <SENTENCE-END> 
  dog <SENTENCE-END>  ha ah ha well masters good night <SENTENCE-END>  an there be any matter
    of weight chances call up me <SENTENCE-END>  keep your fellows counsels and
    your own and good night <SENTENCE-END>  come neighbour <SENTENCE-END>

    how giddily a turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen
    and fiveandthirty sometimes fashioning them like pharaohs
    soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god bels priests
    in the old church window sometime like the shaven hercules in
    the smirchd wormeaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as  
    massy as his club
  con <SENTENCE-END>  all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more
    apparel than the man <SENTENCE-END>  but art not thou thyself giddy with the
    fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling

    master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which

    them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander
    that don john had made away went claudio enragd swore he would
    meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and

    all you that see her that she were a maid
    by these exterior shows but she is none

    her blush is guiltiness not modesty <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  what do you mean my lord
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  not to be married
    not to knit my soul to an approved wanton <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  dear my lord if you in your own proof
    have vanquishd the resistance of her youth
    and made defeat of her virginity
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  i know what you would say <SENTENCE-END>  if i have known her
    you will say she did embrace me as a husband
    and so extenuate the forehand sin <SENTENCE-END> 
    no leonato
    i never tempted her with word too large
    but as a brother to his sister showd
    bashful sincerity and comely love <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  and seemd i ever otherwise to you
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  out on the seeming i will write against it <SENTENCE-END> 
    you seem to me as dian in her orb
    as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
    but you are more intemperate in your blood  
    than venus or those pampred animals
    that rage in savage sensuality <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  sweet prince why speak not you
  pedro <SENTENCE-END>  what should i speak
    i stand dishonourd that have gone about
    to link my dear friend to a common stale <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  are these things spoken or do i but dream
  john <SENTENCE-END>  sir they are spoken and these things are true <SENTENCE-END>

  claud <SENTENCE-END>  let me but move one question to your daughter
    and by that fatherly and kindly power
    that you have in her bid her answer truly <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  i charge thee do so as thou art my child <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  o god defend me how am i beset  
    what kind of catechising call you this
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  to make you answer truly to your name <SENTENCE-END> 
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  is it not hero who can blot that name
    with any just reproach
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  marry that can hero
    hero itself can blot out heros virtue <SENTENCE-END>

    i am sorry you must hear <SENTENCE-END>  upon my honour
    myself my brother and this grieved count
    did see her hear her at that hour last night
    talk with a ruffian at her chamber window
    who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
    confessd the vile encounters they have had
    a thousand times in secret <SENTENCE-END> 
  john <SENTENCE-END>  fie fie they are not to be namd my lord
    not to be spoke of  
    there is not chastity enough in language
    without offence to utter them <SENTENCE-END>  thus pretty lady
    i am sorry for thy much misgovernment <SENTENCE-END> 
  claud <SENTENCE-END>  o hero what a hero hadst thou been
    if half thy outward graces had been placd
    about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
    but fare thee well most foul most fair farewell
    thou pure impiety and impious purity
    for thee ill lock up all the gates of love
    and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
    to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
    and never shall it more be gracious <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  hath no mans dagger here a point for me
                                                  hero swoons <SENTENCE-END>

  beat <SENTENCE-END>  how now cousin hero
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  have comfort lady <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou look up
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  yea wherefore should she not
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  wherefore why doth not every earthly thing
    cry shame upon her could she here deny
    the story that is printed in her blood
    do not live hero do not ope thine eyes
    for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die
    thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
    myself would on the rearward of reproaches
    strike at thy life <SENTENCE-END>  grievd i i had but one
    child i for that at frugal natures frame
    o one too much by thee why had i one
    why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
    why had i not with charitable hand  
    took up a beggars issue at my gates
    who smirched thus and mird with infamy
    i might have said no part of it is mine
    this shame derives itself from unknown loins
    but mine and mine i lovd and mine i praisd
    and mine that i was proud onmine so much
    that i myself was to myself not mine
    valuing of herwhy she o she is falln
    into a pit of ink that the wide sea
    hath drops too few to wash her clean again
    and salt too little which may season give
    to her foul tainted flesh
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  sir sir be patient <SENTENCE-END> 
    for my part i am so attird in wonder
    i know not what to say <SENTENCE-END> 
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  o on my soul my cousin is belied
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  lady were you her bedfellow last night
  beat <SENTENCE-END>  no truly not although until last night
    i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made  
    which was before barrd up with ribs of iron
    would the two princes lie and claudio lie
    who lovd her so that speaking of her foulness
    washd it with tears hence from her let her die <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  hear me a little
    for i have only been silent so long
    and given way unto this course of fortune
    by noting of the lady <SENTENCE-END>  i have markd
    a thousand blushing apparitions
    to start into her face a thousand innocent shames
    in angel whiteness beat away those blushes
    and in her eye there hath appeard a fire
    to burn the errors that these princes hold
    against her maiden truth <SENTENCE-END>  call me a fool
    trust not my reading nor my observation
    which with experimental seal doth warrant
    the tenure of my book trust not my age
    my reverence calling nor divinity
    if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
    under some biting error <SENTENCE-END>   
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  friar it cannot be <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
    is that she will not add to her damnation
    a sin of perjury she not denies it <SENTENCE-END> 
    why seekst thou then to cover with excuse
    that which appears in proper nakedness
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  lady what man is he you are accusd of
  hero <SENTENCE-END>  they know that do accuse me i know none <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i know more of any man alive
    than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
    let all my sins lack mercy o my father
    prove you that any man with me conversd
    at hours unmeet or that i yesternight
    maintaind the change of words with any creature
    refuse me hate me torture me to death
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  there is some strange misprision in the princes <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  two of them have the very bent of honour
    and if their wisdoms be misled in this
    the practice of it lives in john the bastard
    whose spirits toil in frame of villanies <SENTENCE-END>   
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  i know not <SENTENCE-END>  if they speak but truth of her
    these hands shall tear her <SENTENCE-END>  if they wrong her honour
    the proudest of them shall well hear of it <SENTENCE-END> 
    time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
    nor age so eat up my invention
    nor fortune made such havoc of my means
    nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
    but they shall find awakd in such a kind
    both strength of limb and policy of mind
    ability in means and choice of friends
    to quit me of them throughly <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  pause awhile
    and let my counsel sway you in this case <SENTENCE-END> 
    your daughter here the princes left for dead
    let her awhile be secretly kept in
    and publish it that she is dead indeed
    maintain a mourning ostentation
    and on your familys old monument
    hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
    that appertain unto a burial <SENTENCE-END>   
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  what shall become of this what will this do
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  marry this well carried shall on her behalf
    change slander to remorse <SENTENCE-END>  that is some good <SENTENCE-END> 
    but not for that dream i on this strange course
    but on this travail look for greater birth <SENTENCE-END> 
    she dying as it must be so maintaind
    upon the instant that she was accusd
    shall be lamented pitied and excusd
    of every hearer for it so falls out
    that what we have we prize not to the worth
    whiles we enjoy it but being lackd and lost
    why then we rack the value then we find
    the virtue that possession would not show us
    whiles it was ours <SENTENCE-END>  so will it fare with claudio <SENTENCE-END> 
    when he shall hear she died upon his words
    th idea of her life shall sweetly creep
    into his study of imagination
    and every lovely organ of her life
    shall come apparelld in more precious habit
    more moving delicate and full of life  
    into the eye and prospect of his soul
    than when she livd indeed <SENTENCE-END>  then shall he mourn
    if ever love had interest in his liver
    and wish he had not so accused her
    no though be thought his accusation true <SENTENCE-END> 
    let this be so and doubt not but success
    will fashion the event in better shape
    than i can lay it down in likelihood <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if all aim but this be levelld false
    the supposition of the ladys death
    will quench the wonder of her infamy <SENTENCE-END> 
    and if it sort not well you may conceal her
    as best befits her wounded reputation
    in some reclusive and religious life
    out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries <SENTENCE-END> 
  bene <SENTENCE-END>  signior leonato let the friar advise you
    and though you know my inwardness and love
    is very much unto the prince and claudio
    yet by mine honour i will deal in this
    as secretly and justly as your soul  
    should with your body <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  being that i flow in grief
    the smallest twine may lead me <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  tis well consented <SENTENCE-END>  presently away
    for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure <SENTENCE-END> 
    come lady die to live <SENTENCE-END>  this wedding day

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
the street near leonatos house <SENTENCE-END> 

enter leonato and his brother  antonio <SENTENCE-END> 

  ant <SENTENCE-END>  if you go on thus you will kill yourself
    and tis not wisdom thus to second grief
    against yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee cease thy counsel
    which falls into mine ears as profitless
    as water in a sieve <SENTENCE-END>  give not me counsel
    nor let no comforter delight mine ear
    but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine <SENTENCE-END> 
    bring me a father that so lovd his child
    whose joy of her is overwhelmd like mine
    and bid him speak to me of patience <SENTENCE-END> 
    measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
    and let it answer every strain for strain
    as thus for thus and such a grief for such
    in every lineament branch shape and form <SENTENCE-END> 
    if such a one will smile and stroke his beard
    bid sorrow wag cry hem when he should groan  
    patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
    with candlewastersbring him yet to me
    and i of him will gather patience <SENTENCE-END> 
    but there is no such man for brother men
    can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
    which they themselves not feel but tasting it
    their counsel turns to passion which before
    would give preceptial medicine to rage
    fetter strong madness in a silken thread
    charm ache with air and agony with words <SENTENCE-END> 
    no no tis all mens office to speak patience
    to those that wring under the load of sorrow
    but no mans virtue nor sufficiency
    to be so moral when he shall endure
    the like himself <SENTENCE-END>  therefore give me no counsel <SENTENCE-END> 
    my griefs cry louder than advertisement <SENTENCE-END> 
  ant <SENTENCE-END>  therein do men from children nothing differ <SENTENCE-END> 
  leon <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee peace <SENTENCE-END>  i will be flesh and blood
    for there was never yet philosopher
    that could endure the toothache patiently  
    however they have writ the style of gods
    and made a push at chance and sufferance <SENTENCE-END>

scene venice and cyprus

act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
venice <SENTENCE-END>  a street <SENTENCE-END> 

enter roderigo and iago <SENTENCE-END> 

  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  tush never tell me i take it much unkindly
    that thou iago who hast had my purse
    as if the strings were thine shouldst know of this <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  sblood but you will not hear me <SENTENCE-END> 
    if ever i did dream of such a matter
    abhor me <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  despise me if i do not <SENTENCE-END>  three great ones of the city
    in personal suit to make me his lieutenant
    offcappd to him and by the faith of man
    i know my price i am worth no worse a place <SENTENCE-END> 
    but he as loving his own pride and purposes
    evades them with a bumbast circumstance
    horribly stuffd with epithets of war
    and in conclusion
    nonsuits my mediators for certes says he
    i have already chose my officer <SENTENCE-END>   
    and what was he
    forsooth a great arithmetician
    one michael cassio a florentine
    a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife
    that never set a squadron in the field
    nor the division of a battle knows
    more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
    wherein the toged consuls can propose
    as masterly as he <SENTENCE-END>  mere prattle without practice
    is all his soldiership <SENTENCE-END>  but he sir had the election
    and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof
    at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds
    christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd
    by debitor and creditor <SENTENCE-END>  this countercaster
    he in good time must his lieutenant be
    and i god bless the mark his moorships ancient <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven i rather would have been his hangman <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  why theres no remedy <SENTENCE-END>  tis the curse of service
    preferment goes by letter and affection
    and not by old gradation where each second  
    stood heir to the first <SENTENCE-END>  now sir be judge yourself
    whether i in any just term am affined
    to love the moor <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>            i would not follow him then <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  o sir content you <SENTENCE-END> 
    i follow him to serve my turn upon him
    we cannot all be masters nor all masters
    cannot be truly followd <SENTENCE-END>  you shall mark
    many a duteous and kneecrooking knave
    that doting on his own obsequious bondage
    wears out his time much like his masters ass
    for nought but provender and when hes old cashierd <SENTENCE-END> 
    whip me such honest knaves <SENTENCE-END>  others there are
    who trimmd in forms and visages of duty
    keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
    and throwing but shows of service on their lords
    do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
    do themselves homage <SENTENCE-END>  these fellows have some soul
    and such a one do i profess myself <SENTENCE-END> 
    for sir  
    it is as sure as you are roderigo
    were i the moor i would not be iago <SENTENCE-END> 
    in following him i follow but myself
    heaven is my judge not i for love and duty
    but seeming so for my peculiar end <SENTENCE-END> 
    for when my outward action doth demonstrate
    the native act and figure of my heart
    in complement extern tis not long after
    but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve
    for daws to peck at i am not what i am <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  what a full fortune does the thicklips owe
    if he can carryt thus
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                      call up her father
    rouse him make after him poison his delight
    proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
    and though he in a fertile climate dwell
    plague him with flies <SENTENCE-END>  though that his joy be joy
    yet throw such changes of vexation ont
    as it may lose some color <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  here is her fathers house ill call aloud <SENTENCE-END>   
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  do with like timorous accent and dire yell
    as when by night and negligence the fire
    is spied in populous cities <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  what ho brabantio signior brabantio ho
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  awake what ho brabantio thieves thieves thieves

    i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors <SENTENCE-END> 
    in honest plainness thou hast heard me say
    my daughter is not for thee and now in madness
    being full of supper and distempering draughts
    upon malicious bravery dost thou come
    to start my quiet <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  sir sir sir
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                but thou must needs be sure
    my spirit and my place have in them power
    to make this bitter to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>                       patience good sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  what tellst thou me of robbing this is venice
    my house is not a grange <SENTENCE-END>   
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>                    most grave brabantio
    in simple and pure soul i come to you <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god
    if the devil bid you <SENTENCE-END>  because we come to do you service and you
    think we are ruffians youll have your daughter covered with a
    barbary horse youll have your nephews neigh to you youll have
    coursers for cousins and gennets for germans <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  what profane wretch art thou
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the
    moor are now making the beast with two backs <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  thou are a villain <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                           you are a senator <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  this thou shalt answer i know thee roderigo <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  sir i will answer anything <SENTENCE-END>  but i beseech you
    ift be your pleasure and most wise consent
    as partly i find it is that your fair daughter
    at this oddeven and dull watch o the night
    transported with no worse nor better guard
    but with a knave of common hire a gondolier
    to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor  
    if this be known to you and your allowance
    we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
    but if you know not this my manners tell me
    we have your wrong rebuke <SENTENCE-END>  do not believe
    that from the sense of all civility
    i thus would play and trifle with your reverence <SENTENCE-END> 
    your daughter if you have not given her leave
    i say again hath made a gross revolt
    tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
    in an extravagant and wheeling stranger
    of here and everywhere <SENTENCE-END>  straight satisfy yourself
    if she be in her chamber or your house
    let loose on me the justice of the state
    for thus deluding you <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                strike on the tinder ho
    give me a taper call up all my people
    this accident is not unlike my dream
    belief of it oppresses me already <SENTENCE-END> 
    light i say light                                  exit above <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                   farewell for i must leave you <SENTENCE-END>   
    it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
    to be produced as if i stay i shall
    against the moor for i do know the state
    however this may gall him with some check
    cannot with safety cast him for hes embarkd
    with such loud reason to the cyprus wars
    which even now stands in act that for their souls
    another of his fathom they have none
    to lead their business in which regard
    though i do hate him as i do hell pains
    yet for necessity of present life
    i must show out a flag and sign of love
    which is indeed but sign <SENTENCE-END>  that you shall surely find him
    lead to the sagittary the raised search
    and there will i be with him <SENTENCE-END>  so farewell <SENTENCE-END>                   exit <SENTENCE-END> 

            enter below brabantio in his nightgown and
                        servants with torches <SENTENCE-END> 

  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  it is too true an evil gone she is  
    and whats to come of my despised time
    is nought but bitterness <SENTENCE-END>  now roderigo
    where didst thou see her o unhappy girl
    with the moor sayst thou who would be a father
    how didst thou know twas she o she deceives me
    past thought what said she to you get more tapers <SENTENCE-END> 
    raise all my kindred <SENTENCE-END>  are they married think you
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  truly i think they are <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  o heaven how got she out o treason of the blood
    fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds
    by what you see them act <SENTENCE-END>  is there not charms
    by which the property of youth and maidhood
    may be abused have you not read roderigo
    of some such thing
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>              yes sir i have indeed <SENTENCE-END>

    some one way some another <SENTENCE-END>  do you know
    where we may apprehend her and the moor

    to get good guard and go along with me <SENTENCE-END>   
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  pray you lead on <SENTENCE-END>  at every house ill call

         enter brabantio roderigo and officers with torches
                             and weapons <SENTENCE-END> 

  othello <SENTENCE-END>                   holla stand there  
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  signior it is the moor <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                          down with him thief
                                             they draw on both sides <SENTENCE-END>

  othello <SENTENCE-END>  keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them <SENTENCE-END> 
    good signior you shall more command with years
    than with your weapons <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  o thou foul thief where hast thou stowd my daughter
    damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
    for ill refer me to all things of sense
    if she in chains of magic were not bound
    whether a maid so tender fair and happy
    so opposite to marriage that she shunnd
    the wealthy curled darlings of our nation
    would ever have to incur a general mock
    run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
    of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight <SENTENCE-END> 
    judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
    that thou hast practiced on her with foul charms
    abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals  
    that weaken motion <SENTENCE-END>  ill havet disputed on
    tis probable and palpable to thinking <SENTENCE-END> 
    i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
    for an abuser of the world a practicer
    of arts inhibited and out of warrant <SENTENCE-END> 
    lay hold upon him <SENTENCE-END>  if he do resist
    subdue him at his peril <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                    hold your hands
    both you of my inclining and the rest <SENTENCE-END> 
    were it my cue to fight i should have known it
    without a prompter <SENTENCE-END>  where will you that i go
    to answer this your charge
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                     to prison till fit time
    of law and course of direct session
    call thee to answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                what if i do obey
    how may the duke be therewith satisfied
    whose messengers are here about my side
    upon some present business of the state
    to bring me to him  
  first officer <SENTENCE-END>         tis true most worthy signior
    the dukes in council and your noble self
    i am sure is sent for <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                 how the duke in council
    in this time of the night bring him away
    mines not an idle cause <SENTENCE-END>  the duke himself
    or any of my brothers of the state
    cannot but feel this wrong as twere their own
    for if such actions may have passage free
    bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be <SENTENCE-END>             exeunt <SENTENCE-END> 




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
a council chamber <SENTENCE-END>  the duke and senators sitting at a table
officers attending <SENTENCE-END> 

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  there is no composition in these news
    that gives them credit <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>             indeed they are disproportiond
    my letters say a hundred and seven galleys <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  and mine a hundred and forty <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>                       and mine two hundred <SENTENCE-END> 
    but though they jump not on a just account
    as in these cases where the aim reports
    tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm
    a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  nay it is possible enough to judgement <SENTENCE-END> 
    i do not so secure me in the error
    but the main article i do approve
    in fearful sense <SENTENCE-END> 
  sailor <SENTENCE-END>  within <SENTENCE-END>  what ho what ho what ho
  first officer <SENTENCE-END>  a messenger from the galleys <SENTENCE-END> 

                            enter sailor <SENTENCE-END> 
  
  duke <SENTENCE-END>                                 now whats the business
  sailor <SENTENCE-END>  the turkish preparation makes for rhodes
    so was i bid report here to the state
    by signior angelo <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  how say you by this change
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>                     this cannot be
    by no assay of reason tis a pageant
    to keep us in false gaze <SENTENCE-END>  when we consider
    the importancy of cyprus to the turk
    and let ourselves again but understand
    that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes
    so may he with more facile question bear it
    for that it stands not in such warlike brace
    but altogether lacks the abilities
    that rhodes is dressd in <SENTENCE-END>  if we make thought of this
    we must not think the turk is so unskillful
    to leave that latest which concerns him first
    neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
    to wake and wage a danger profitless <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  nay in all confidence hes not for rhodes <SENTENCE-END>   
  first officer <SENTENCE-END>  here is more news <SENTENCE-END> 

                          enter a messenger <SENTENCE-END> 

  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  the ottomites reverend and gracious
    steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes
    have there injointed them with an after fleet <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  ay so i thought <SENTENCE-END>  how many as you guess
  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  of thirty sail and now they do restem
    their backward course bearing with frank appearance
    their purposes toward cyprus <SENTENCE-END>  signior montano
    your trusty and most valiant servitor
    with his free duty recommends you thus
    and prays you to believe him <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  tis certain then for cyprus <SENTENCE-END> 
    marcus luccicos is not he in town
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  hes now in florence <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  write from us to him postposthaste dispatch <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  here comes brabantio and the valiant moor <SENTENCE-END> 
  
       enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers <SENTENCE-END> 

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  valiant othello we must straight employ you
    against the general enemy ottoman <SENTENCE-END> 
    to brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  i did not see you welcome gentle signior
    we lackd your counsel and your help tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  so did i yours <SENTENCE-END>  good your grace pardon me
    neither my place nor aught i heard of business
    hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
    take hold on me for my particular grief
    is of so floodgate and oerbearing nature
    that it engluts and swallows other sorrows
    and it is still itself <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>                      why whats the matter
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  my daughter o my daughter
  all <SENTENCE-END>                                     dead
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                                     ay to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    she is abused stoln from me and corrupted
    by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
    for nature so preposterously to err  
    being not deficient blind or lame of sense
    sans witchcraft could not <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding
    hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
    and you of her the bloody book of law
    you shall yourself read in the bitter letter
    after your own sense yea though our proper son
    stood in your action <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>               humbly i thank your grace <SENTENCE-END> 
    here is the man this moor whom now it seems
    your special mandate for the state affairs
    hath hither brought <SENTENCE-END> 
  all <SENTENCE-END>                    we are very sorry fort <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  to othello <SENTENCE-END>  what in your own part can you say to this
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  nothing but this is so <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  most potent grave and reverend signiors
    my very noble and approved good masters
    that i have taen away this old mans daughter
    it is most true true i have married her
    the very head and front of my offending  
    hath this extent no more <SENTENCE-END>  rude am i in my speech
    and little blest with the soft phrase of peace
    for since these arms of mine had seven years pith
    till now some nine moons wasted they have used
    their dearest action in the tented field
    and little of this great world can i speak
    more than pertains to feats of broil and battle
    and therefore little shall i grace my cause
    in speaking for myself <SENTENCE-END>  yet by your gracious patience
    i will a round unvarnishd tale deliver
    of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
    what conjuration and what mighty magic
    for such proceeding i am charged withal
    i won his daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>             a maiden never bold
    of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
    blushd at herself and she in spite of nature
    of years of country credit everything
    to fall in love with what she feard to look on
    it is judgement maimd and most imperfect  
    that will confess perfection so could err
    against all rules of nature and must be driven
    to find out practices of cunning hell
    why this should be <SENTENCE-END>  i therefore vouch again
    that with some mixtures powerful oer the blood
    or with some dram conjured to this effect
    he wrought upon her <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>                   to vouch this is no proof
    without more certain and more overt test
    than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
    of modern seeming do prefer against him <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  but othello speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    did you by indirect and forced courses
    subdue and poison this young maids affections
    or came it by request and such fair question
    as soul to soul affordeth
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                      i do beseech you
    send for the lady to the sagittary
    and let her speak of me before her father <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you do find me foul in her report  
    the trust the office i do hold of you
    not only take away but let your sentence
    even fall upon my life <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>                      fetch desdemona hither <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  ancient conduct them you best know the place <SENTENCE-END> 
                                          exeunt iago and attendants <SENTENCE-END> 
    and till she come as truly as to heaven
    i do confess the vices of my blood
    so justly to your grave ears ill present
    how i did thrive in this fair ladys love
    and she in mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  say it othello <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  her father loved me oft invited me
    still questiond me the story of my life
    from year to year the battles sieges fortunes
    that i have passd <SENTENCE-END> 
    i ran it through even from my boyish days
    to the very moment that he bade me tell it
    wherein i spake of most disastrous chances
    of moving accidents by flood and field  
    of hairbreadth scapes i the imminent deadly breach
    of being taken by the insolent foe
    and sold to slavery of my redemption thence
    and portance in my travels history
    wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
    rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
    it was my hint to speak such was the process
    and of the cannibals that each other eat
    the anthropophagi and men whose heads
    do grow beneath their shoulders <SENTENCE-END>  this to hear
    would desdemona seriously incline
    but still the house affairs would draw her thence
    which ever as she could with haste dispatch
    sheld come again and with a greedy ear
    devour up my discourse which i observing
    took once a pliant hour and found good means
    to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    that i would all my pilgrimage dilate
    whereof by parcels she had something heard
    but not intentively <SENTENCE-END>  i did consent  
    and often did beguile her of her tears
    when i did speak of some distressful stroke
    that my youth sufferd <SENTENCE-END>  my story being done
    she gave me for my pains a world of sighs
    she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
    twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful <SENTENCE-END> 
    she wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd
    that heaven had made her such a man she thankd me
    and bade me if i had a friend that loved her
    i should but teach him how to tell my story
    and that would woo her <SENTENCE-END>  upon this hint i spake
    she loved me for the dangers i had passd
    and i loved her that she did pity them <SENTENCE-END> 
    this only is the witchcraft i have used <SENTENCE-END> 
    here comes the lady let her witness it <SENTENCE-END> 

                enter desdemona iago and attendants <SENTENCE-END> 

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  i think this tale would win my daughter too <SENTENCE-END> 
    good brabantio  
    take up this mangled matter at the best
    men do their broken weapons rather use
    than their bare hands <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                i pray you hear her speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    if she confess that she was half the wooer
    destruction on my head if my bad blame
    light on the man come hither gentle mistress <SENTENCE-END> 
    do you perceive in all this noble company
    where most you owe obedience
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>                       my noble father
    i do perceive here a divided duty <SENTENCE-END> 
    to you i am bound for life and education
    my life and education both do learn me
    how to respect you you are the lord of duty
    i am hitherto your daughter <SENTENCE-END>  but heres my husband
    and so much duty as my mother showd
    to you preferring you before her father
    so much i challenge that i may profess
    due to the moor my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>                   god be with you i have done <SENTENCE-END>   
    please it your grace on to the state affairs
    i had rather to adopt a child than get it <SENTENCE-END> 
    come hither moor <SENTENCE-END> 
    i here do give thee that with all my heart
    which but thou hast already with all my heart
    i would keep from thee <SENTENCE-END>  for your sake jewel
    i am glad at soul i have no other child
    for thy escape would teach me tyranny
    to hang clogs on them <SENTENCE-END>  i have done my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
    which as a grise or step may help these lovers
    into your favor <SENTENCE-END> 
    when remedies are past the griefs are ended
    by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended <SENTENCE-END> 
    to mourn a mischief that is past and gone
    is the next way to draw new mischief on <SENTENCE-END> 
    what cannot be preserved when fortune takes
    patience her injury a mockery makes <SENTENCE-END> 
    the robbd that smiles steals something from the thief
    he robs himself that spends a bootless grief <SENTENCE-END>   
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>  so let the turk of cyprus us beguile
    we lose it not so long as we can smile <SENTENCE-END> 
    he bears the sentence well that nothing bears
    but the free comfort which from thence he hears
    but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow <SENTENCE-END> 
    these sentences to sugar or to gall
    being strong on both sides are equivocal <SENTENCE-END> 
    but words are words i never yet did hear
    that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear <SENTENCE-END> 
    i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus <SENTENCE-END> 
    othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and
    though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency
    yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
    voice on you <SENTENCE-END>  you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss
    of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous
    expedition <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  the tyrant custom most grave senators
    hath made the flinty and steel couch of war  
    my thricedriven bed of down <SENTENCE-END>  i do agnize
    a natural and prompt alacrity
    i find in hardness and do undertake
    these present wars against the ottomites <SENTENCE-END> 
    most humbly therefore bending to your state
    i crave fit disposition for my wife
    due reference of place and exhibition
    with such accommodation and besort
    as levels with her breeding <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>                           if you please
    bet at her fathers <SENTENCE-END> 
  brabantio <SENTENCE-END>               ill not have it so <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  nor i <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>       nor i <SENTENCE-END>  i would not there reside
    to put my father in impatient thoughts
    by being in his eye <SENTENCE-END>  most gracious duke
    to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
    and let me find a charter in your voice
    to assist my simpleness <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  what would you desdemona  
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  that i did love the moor to live with him
    my downright violence and storm of fortunes
    may trumpet to the world <SENTENCE-END>  my hearts subdued
    even to the very quality of my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    i saw othellos visage in his mind
    and to his honors and his valiant parts
    did i my soul and fortunes consecrate <SENTENCE-END> 
    so that dear lords if i be left behind
    a moth of peace and he go to the war
    the rites for which i love him are bereft me
    and i a heavy interim shall support
    by his dear absence <SENTENCE-END>  let me go with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  let her have your voices <SENTENCE-END> 
    vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not
    to please the palate of my appetite
    nor to comply with heat the young affects
    in me defunct and proper satisfaction
    but to be free and bounteous to her mind <SENTENCE-END> 
    and heaven defend your good souls that you think
    i will your serious and great business scant  
    for she is with me <SENTENCE-END>  no when lightwingd toys
    of featherd cupid seel with wanton dullness
    my speculative and officed instruments
    that my disports corrupt and taint my business
    let housewives make a skillet of my helm
    and all indign and base adversities
    make head against my estimation
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  be it as you shall privately determine
    either for her stay or going <SENTENCE-END>  the affair cries haste

  othello <SENTENCE-END>  my life upon her faith honest iago
    my desdemona must i leave to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    i prithee let thy wife attend on her
    and bring them after in the best advantage <SENTENCE-END> 
    come desdemona i have but an hour
    of love of worldly matters and direction
    to spend with thee <SENTENCE-END>  we must obey the time <SENTENCE-END> 
                                        exeunt othello and desdemona <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  iago  
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  what sayst thou noble heart
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  what will i do thinkest thou
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  why go to bed and sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  i will incontinently drown myself <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  if thou dost i shall never love thee after <SENTENCE-END> 
    why thou silly gentleman
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then
    have we a prescription to die when death is our physician <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  o villainous i have looked upon the world for four times
    seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and
    an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself <SENTENCE-END>  ere i
    would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i
    would change my humanity with a baboon <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond
    but it is not in my virtue to amend it <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus <SENTENCE-END> 
    our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so
    that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed
    up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with
    many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with  
    industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
    our wills <SENTENCE-END>  if the balance of our lives had not one scale of
    reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of
    our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions <SENTENCE-END> 
    but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings
    our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to
    be a sect or scion <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  it cannot be <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
    will <SENTENCE-END>  come be a man drown thyself drown cats and blind
    puppies <SENTENCE-END>  i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to
    thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never
    better stead thee than now <SENTENCE-END>  put money in thy purse follow thou
    the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard <SENTENCE-END>  i say put
    money in thy purse <SENTENCE-END>  it cannot be that desdemona should long
    continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his
    to her <SENTENCE-END>  it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an
    answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse <SENTENCE-END>  these moors
    are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money <SENTENCE-END>  the
    food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him  
    shortly as acerb as the coloquintida <SENTENCE-END>  she must change for youth
    when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her
    choice <SENTENCE-END>  she must have change she must therefore put money in
    thy purse <SENTENCE-END>  if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate
    way than drowning <SENTENCE-END>  make all the money thou canst <SENTENCE-END>  if sanctimony
    and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle
    venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell
    thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money <SENTENCE-END>  a pox of drowning
    thyself it is clean out of the way <SENTENCE-END>  seek thou rather to be
    hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without
    her <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  thou art sure of me go make money <SENTENCE-END>  i have told thee often
    and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor <SENTENCE-END>  my cause is
    hearted thine hath no less reason <SENTENCE-END>  let us be conjunctive in our
    revenge against him <SENTENCE-END>  if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself
    a pleasure me a sport <SENTENCE-END>  there are many events in the womb of time
    which will be delivered <SENTENCE-END>  traverse go provide thy money <SENTENCE-END>  we will
    have more of this tomorrow <SENTENCE-END>  adieu <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  where shall we meet i the morning  
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  at my lodging <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  ill be with thee betimes <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  go to farewell <SENTENCE-END>  do you hear roderigo
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  what say you
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  no more of drowning do you hear
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  i am changed ill go sell all my land <SENTENCE-END>              exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  thus do i ever make my fool my purse
    for i mine own gaind knowledge should profane
    if i would time expend with such a snipe
    but for my sport and profit <SENTENCE-END>  i hate the moor
    and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
    he has done my office <SENTENCE-END>  i know not ift be true
    but i for mere suspicion in that kind
    will do as if for surety <SENTENCE-END>  he holds me well
    the better shall my purpose work on him <SENTENCE-END> 
    cassios a proper man <SENTENCE-END>  let me see now
    to get his place and to plume up my will
    in double knavery how how lets see
    after some time to abuse othellos ear
    that he is too familiar with his wife <SENTENCE-END>   
    he hath a person and a smooth dispose
    to be suspected framed to make women false <SENTENCE-END> 
    the moor is of a free and open nature
    that thinks men honest that but seem to be so
    and will as tenderly be led by the nose
    as asses are <SENTENCE-END> 
    i havet <SENTENCE-END>  it is engenderd <SENTENCE-END>  hell and night
    must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light <SENTENCE-END> 
     exit <SENTENCE-END>

enter montano and two gentlemen <SENTENCE-END> 

  montano <SENTENCE-END>  what from the cape can you discern at sea
  first gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  nothing at all <SENTENCE-END>  it is a highwrought flood
    i cannot twixt the heaven and the main
    descry a sail <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>  methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
    a fuller blast neer shook our battlements <SENTENCE-END> 
    if it hath ruffiand so upon the sea
    what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
    can hold the mortise what shall we hear of this
  second gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  a segregation of the turkish fleet <SENTENCE-END> 
    for do but stand upon the foaming shore
    the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
    the windshaked surge with high and monstrous mane
    seems to cast water on the burning bear
    and quench the guards of the everfixed pole <SENTENCE-END> 
    i never did like molestation view
    on the enchafed flood <SENTENCE-END>   
  montano <SENTENCE-END>                  if that the turkish fleet
    be not enshelterd and embayd they are drownd
    it is impossible to bear it out <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter a third gentleman <SENTENCE-END> 

  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  news lads our wars are done <SENTENCE-END>

    that their designment halts <SENTENCE-END>  a noble ship of venice
    hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
    on most part of their fleet <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>  how is this true

    and is in full commission here for cyprus <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>  i am glad ont tis a worthy governor <SENTENCE-END> 
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  but this same cassio though he speak of comfort
    touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly  
    and prays the moor be safe for they were parted
    with foul and violent tempest <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>                          pray heavens he be
    for i have served him and the man commands
    like a full soldier <SENTENCE-END>  lets to the seaside ho
    as well to see the vessel thats come in
    as to throw out our eyes for brave othello
    even till we make the main and the aerial blue
    an indistinct regard <SENTENCE-END> 
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  come lets do so
    for every minute is expectancy
    of more arrivance <SENTENCE-END> 

                            enter cassio <SENTENCE-END> 

  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
    that so approve the moor o let the heavens
    give him defense against the elements
    for i have lost him on a dangerous sea <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>  i she well shippd  
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  his bark is stoutly timberd and his pilot
    of very expert and approved allowance
    therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
    stand in bold cure <SENTENCE-END> 
                              a cry within a sail a sail a sail

  montano <SENTENCE-END>  but good lieutenant is your general wived
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  most fortunately he hath achieved a maid  
    that paragons description and wild fame
    one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
    and in the essential vesture of creation
    does tire the ingener <SENTENCE-END> 

                      reenter second gentleman <SENTENCE-END> 

                           how now who has put in

    as having sense of beauty do omit
    their mortal natures letting go safely by
    the divine desdemona <SENTENCE-END>

  iago <SENTENCE-END>  in faith too much
    i find it still when i have list to sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
    marry before your ladyship i grant
    she puts her tongue a little in her heart
    and chides with thinking <SENTENCE-END>   
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  you have little cause to say so <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  come on come on <SENTENCE-END>  you are pictures out of doors
    bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens
    saints in your injuries devils being offended
    players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  o fie upon thee slanderer
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  nay it is true or else i am a turk
    you rise to play and go to bed to work <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  you shall not write my praise <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                                   no let me not <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
    praise me
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  o gentle lady do not put me tot

  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  come on assay theres one gone to the harbor
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  ay madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i am not merry but i do beguile
    the thing i am by seeming otherwise <SENTENCE-END> 
    come how wouldst thou praise me
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i am about it but indeed my invention  
    comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze
    it plucks out brains and all <SENTENCE-END>  but my muse labors
    and thus she is deliverd <SENTENCE-END> 
    if she be fair and wise fairness and wit
    the ones for use the other useth it <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  well praised how if she be black and witty
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  if she be black and thereto have a wit
    shell find a white that shall her blackness fit <SENTENCE-END>

  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  how if fair and foolish
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  she never yet was foolish that was fair
    for even her folly helpd her to an heir <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the
    alehouse <SENTENCE-END>  what miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and
    foolish
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  theres none so foul and foolish thereunto
    but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  o heavy ignorance thou praisest the worst best <SENTENCE-END>  but what
    praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that
    in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very  
    malice itself
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  she that was ever fair and never proud
    had tongue at will and yet was never loud
    never lackd gold and yet went never gay
    fled from her wish and yet said now i may
    she that being angerd her revenge being nigh
    bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
    she that in wisdom never was so frail
    to change the cods head for the salmons tail
    she that could think and neer disclose her mind
    see suitors following and not look behind
    she was a wight if ever such wight were
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  to do what
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  to suckle fools and chronicle small beer <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  o most lame and impotent conclusion do not learn of him
    emilia though he be thy husband <SENTENCE-END>  how say you cassio is he not
    a most profane and liberal counselor
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  he speaks home madam <SENTENCE-END>  you may relish him more in the
    soldier than in the scholar <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  aside <SENTENCE-END>  he takes her by the palm ay well said whisper <SENTENCE-END>   
    with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as
    cassio <SENTENCE-END>  ay smile upon her do i will gyve thee in thine own
    courtship <SENTENCE-END>  you say true tis so indeed <SENTENCE-END>  if such tricks as these
    strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had
    not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are
    most apt to play the sir in <SENTENCE-END>  very good <SENTENCE-END>  well kissed an excellent
    courtesy tis so indeed <SENTENCE-END>  yet again your fingers to your lips
    would they were clysterpipes for your sake trumpet within <SENTENCE-END>

    twere now to be most happy for i fear
    my soul hath her content so absolute
    that not another comfort like to this
    succeeds in unknown fate <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>                   the heavens forbid
    but that our loves and comforts should increase
    even as our days do grow

    he is a good one and his worthiness
    does challenge much respect <SENTENCE-END>  come desdemona
    once more well met at cyprus <SENTENCE-END> 
                                    exeunt all but iago and roderigo <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  do thou meet me presently at the harbor <SENTENCE-END>  come hither <SENTENCE-END>  if thou
    best valiant as they say base men being in love have then a
    nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me <SENTENCE-END> 
    the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard <SENTENCE-END>  first i
    must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  with him why tis not possible <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed <SENTENCE-END>  mark me
    with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and  
    telling her fantastical lies <SENTENCE-END>  and will she love him still for
    prating let not thy discreet heart think it <SENTENCE-END>  her eye must be
    fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil when
    the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be
    again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite
    loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties
    all which the moor is defective in <SENTENCE-END>  now for want of these
    required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself
    abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor
    very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second
    choice <SENTENCE-END>  now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and
    unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this
    fortune as cassio does a knave very voluble no further
    conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
    seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose
    affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a
    finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
    counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present
    itself a devilish knave besides the knave is handsome young
    and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds  
    look after a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found
    him already <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot believe that in her shes full of most blest
    condition <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  blest figsend the wine she drinks is made of grapes <SENTENCE-END>  if
    she had been blest she would never have loved the moor <SENTENCE-END>  blest
    pudding didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand
    didst not mark that
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  yes that i did but that was but courtesy <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the
    history of lust and foul thoughts <SENTENCE-END>  they met so near with their
    lips that their breaths embraced together <SENTENCE-END>  villainous thoughts
    roderigo when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand
    comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion <SENTENCE-END> 
    pish but sir be you ruled by me <SENTENCE-END>  i have brought you from
    venice <SENTENCE-END>  watch you tonight for the command ill layt upon you <SENTENCE-END> 
    cassio knows you not <SENTENCE-END>  ill not be far from you <SENTENCE-END>  do you find some
    occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or
    tainting his discipline or from what other course you please
    which the time shall more favorably minister <SENTENCE-END>   
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  well <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may
    strike at you <SENTENCE-END>  provoke him that he may for even out of that
    will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall
    come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio <SENTENCE-END> 
    so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means
    i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most
    profitably removed without the which there were no expectation
    of our prosperity <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i warrant thee <SENTENCE-END>  meet me by and by at the citadel <SENTENCE-END>  i must
    fetch his necessaries ashore <SENTENCE-END>  farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  adieu <SENTENCE-END>                                               exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  that cassio loves her i do well believe it
    that she loves him tis apt and of great credit <SENTENCE-END> 
    the moor howbeit that i endure him not
    is of a constant loving noble nature
    and i dare think hell prove to desdemona
    a most dear husband <SENTENCE-END>  now i do love her too
    not out of absolute lust though peradventure  
    i stand accountant for as great a sin
    but partly led to diet my revenge
    for that i do suspect the lusty moor
    hath leapd into my seat the thought whereof
    doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
    and nothing can or shall content my soul
    till i am evend with him wife for wife <SENTENCE-END> 
    or failing so yet that i put the moor
    at least into a jealousy so strong
    that judgement cannot cure <SENTENCE-END>  which thing to do
    if this poor trash of venice whom i trace
    for his quick hunting stand the putting on
    ill have our michael cassio on the hip
    abuse him to the moor in the rank garb
    for i fear cassio with my nightcap too
    make the moor thank me love me and reward me
    for making him egregiously an ass
    and practicing upon his peace and quiet
    even to madness <SENTENCE-END>  tis here but yet confused
    knaverys plain face is never seen till used <SENTENCE-END>                exit <SENTENCE-END>

    and give direction <SENTENCE-END>  and do but see his vice
    tis to his virtue a just equinox
    the one as long as the other <SENTENCE-END>  tis pity of him <SENTENCE-END> 
    i fear the trust othello puts him in
    on some odd time of his infirmity
    will shake this island <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>                   but is he often thus
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  tis evermore the prologue to his sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
    hell watch the horologe a double set

  montano <SENTENCE-END>                         it were well
    the general were put in mind of it <SENTENCE-END> 
    perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
    prizes the virtue that appears in cassio
    and looks not on his evils <SENTENCE-END>  is not this true

                           enter roderigo <SENTENCE-END>

    from her propriety <SENTENCE-END>  what is the matter masters
    honest iago that lookst dead with grieving
    speak who began this on thy love i charge thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i do not know <SENTENCE-END>  friends all but now even now
    in quarter and in terms like bride and groom
    devesting them for bed and then but now
    as if some planet had unwitted men
    swords out and tilting one at others breast
    in opposition bloody <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot speak  
    any beginning to this peevish odds
    and would in action glorious i had lost
    those legs that brought me to a part of it
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  how comes it michael you are thus forgot
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you pardon me i cannot speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  worthy montano you were wont be civil
    the gravity and stillness of your youth
    the world hath noted and your name is great
    in mouths of wisest censure <SENTENCE-END>  whats the matter
    that you unlace your reputation thus
    and spend your rich opinion for the name
    of a nightbrawler give me answer to it <SENTENCE-END> 
  montano <SENTENCE-END>  worthy othello i am hurt to danger <SENTENCE-END> 
    your officer iago can inform you
    while i spare speech which something now offends me
    of all that i do know <SENTENCE-END>  nor know i aught
    by me thats said or done amiss this night
    unless selfcharity be sometimes a vice
    and to defend ourselves it be a sin
    when violence assails us <SENTENCE-END>   
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                     now by heaven
    my blood begins my safer guides to rule
    and passion having my best judgement collied
    assays to lead the way <SENTENCE-END>  if i once stir
    or do but lift this arm the best of you
    shall sink in my rebuke <SENTENCE-END>  give me to know
    how this foul rout began who set it on
    and he that is approved in this offense
    though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
    shall lose me <SENTENCE-END>  what in a town of war
    yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear
    to manage private and domestic quarrel
    in night and on the court and guard of safety
    tis monstrous <SENTENCE-END>  iago who begant
  montano <SENTENCE-END>  if partially affined or leagued in office
    thou dost deliver more or less than truth
    thou art no soldier <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                   touch me not so near
    i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
    than it should do offense to michael cassio  
    yet i persuade myself to speak the truth
    shall nothing wrong him <SENTENCE-END>  thus it is general <SENTENCE-END> 
    montano and myself being in speech
    there comes a fellow crying out for help
    and cassio following him with determined sword
    to execute upon him <SENTENCE-END>  sir this gentleman
    steps in to cassio and entreats his pause <SENTENCE-END> 
    myself the crying fellow did pursue
    lest by his clamor as it so fell out
    the town might fall in fright <SENTENCE-END>  he swift of foot
    outran my purpose and i returnd the rather
    for that i heard the clink and fall of swords
    and cassio high in oath which till tonight
    i neer might say before <SENTENCE-END>  when i came back
    for this was brief i found them close together
    at blow and thrust even as again they were
    when you yourself did part them <SENTENCE-END> 
    more of this matter cannot i report <SENTENCE-END> 
    but men are men the best sometimes forget <SENTENCE-END> 
    though cassio did some little wrong to him  
    as men in rage strike those that wish them best
    yet surely cassio i believe received
    from him that fled some strange indignity
    which patience could not pass <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                          i know iago
    thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
    making it light to cassio <SENTENCE-END>  cassio i love thee
    but never more be officer of mine <SENTENCE-END> 

                    reenter desdemona attended <SENTENCE-END>

    reputation i have lost the immortal part of myself and what
    remains is bestial <SENTENCE-END>  my reputation iago my reputation
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily
    wound there is more sense in that than in reputation <SENTENCE-END>  reputation
    is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and
    lost without deserving <SENTENCE-END>  you have lost no reputation at all
    unless you repute yourself such a loser <SENTENCE-END>  what man there are
    ways to recover the general again <SENTENCE-END>  you are but now cast in his
    mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one
    would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion <SENTENCE-END>  sue
    to him again and hes yours <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
    commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an
    officer <SENTENCE-END>  drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear  
    and discourse fustian with ones own shadow o thou invisible
    spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call
    thee devil
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  what was he that you followed with your sword
    what had he done to you
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i know not <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  ist possible
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a
    quarrel but nothing wherefore <SENTENCE-END>  o god that men should put an
    enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should
    with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves
    into beasts
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  why but you are now well enough <SENTENCE-END>  how came you thus
     recovered
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
    devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me
    frankly despise myself <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  come you are too severe a moraler <SENTENCE-END>  as the time the place
    and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish
    this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your  
    own good <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a
    drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would
    stop them all <SENTENCE-END>  to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and
    presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unblest
    and the ingredient is a devil <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be
    well used <SENTENCE-END>  exclaim no more against it <SENTENCE-END>  and good lieutenant i
    think you think i love you <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i have well approved it sir <SENTENCE-END>  i drunk
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  you or any man living may be drunk at some time man <SENTENCE-END>  ill
    tell you what you shall do <SENTENCE-END>  our generals wife is now the
    general <SENTENCE-END>  i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted
    and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement
    of her parts and graces <SENTENCE-END>  confess yourself freely to her
    importune her help to put you in your place again <SENTENCE-END>  she is of so
    free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a
    vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested <SENTENCE-END>  this
    broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter
    and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your  
    love shall grow stronger than it was before <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  you advise me well <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech
    the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me <SENTENCE-END>  i am desperate of my
    fortunes if they check me here <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  you are in the right <SENTENCE-END>  good night lieutenant i must to the
    watch <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  good night honest iago <SENTENCE-END>                               exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  and whats he then that says i play the villain
    when this advice is free i give and honest
    probal to thinking and indeed the course
    to win the moor again for tis most easy
    the inclining desdemona to subdue
    in any honest suit <SENTENCE-END>  shes framed as fruitful
    as the free elements <SENTENCE-END>  and then for her
    to win the moor weret to renounce his baptism
    all seals and symbols of redeemed sin
    his soul is so enfetterd to her love
    that she may make unmake do what she list  
    even as her appetite shall play the god
    with his weak function <SENTENCE-END>  how am i then a villain
    to counsel cassio to this parallel course
    directly to his good divinity of hell
    when devils will the blackest sins put on
    they do suggest at first with heavenly shows
    as i do now <SENTENCE-END>  for whiles this honest fool
    plies desdemona to repair his fortune
    and she for him pleads strongly to the moor
    ill pour this pestilence into his ear
    that she repeals him for her bodys lust
    and by how much she strives to do him good
    she shall undo her credit with the moor <SENTENCE-END> 
    so will i turn her virtue into pitch
    and out of her own goodness make the net
    that shall enmesh them all <SENTENCE-END> 

                           enter roderigo <SENTENCE-END> 

                                how now roderigo

    hunts but one that fills up the cry <SENTENCE-END>  my money is almost spent i
    have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and i think the
    issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and
    so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to
    venice <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  how poor are they that have not patience
    what wound did ever heal but by degrees
    thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft
    and wit depends on dilatory time <SENTENCE-END> 
    doest not go well cassio hath beaten thee
    and thou by that small hurt hast cashierd cassio <SENTENCE-END> 
    though other things grow fair against the sun
    yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe <SENTENCE-END> 
    content thyself awhile <SENTENCE-END>  by the mass tis morning
    pleasure and action make the hours seem short <SENTENCE-END> 
    retire thee go where thou art billeted <SENTENCE-END> 
    away i say <SENTENCE-END>  thou shalt know more hereafter <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay get thee gone <SENTENCE-END>  exit roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  two things are to be done
    my wife must move for cassio to her mistress  
    ill set her on
    myself the while to draw the moor apart
    and bring him jump when he may cassio find
    soliciting his wife <SENTENCE-END>  ay thats the way
    dull not device by coldness and delay <SENTENCE-END>                       exit <SENTENCE-END>

  othello <SENTENCE-END>              i do believe twas he <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  how now my lord
    i have been talking with a suitor here
    a man that languishes in your displeasure <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  who ist you mean
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  why your lieutenant cassio <SENTENCE-END>  good my lord
    if i have any grace or power to move you
    his present reconciliation take
    for if he be not one that truly loves you
    that errs in ignorance and not in cunning
    i have no judgement in an honest face <SENTENCE-END>   
    i prithee call him back <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                     went he hence now
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  ay sooth so humbled
    that he hath left part of his grief with me

  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn
    on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn <SENTENCE-END> 
    i prithee name the time but let it not
    exceed three days <SENTENCE-END>  in faith hes penitent
    and yet his trespass in our common reason
    save that they say the wars must make example
    out of their best is not almost a fault  
    to incur a private check <SENTENCE-END>  when shall he come
    tell me othello <SENTENCE-END>  i wonder in my soul
    what you would ask me that i should deny
    or stand so mammering on <SENTENCE-END>  what michael cassio
    that came awooing with you and so many a time
    when i have spoke of you dispraisingly
    hath taen your part to have so much to do
    to bring him in trust me i could do much
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  prithee no more <SENTENCE-END>  let him come when he will
    i will deny thee nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>                   why this is not a boon
    tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves
    or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
    or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
    to your own person <SENTENCE-END>  nay when i have a suit
    wherein i mean to touch your love indeed
    it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
    and fearful to be granted <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                      i will deny thee nothing
    whereon i do beseech thee grant me this  
    to leave me but a little to myself <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  shall i deny you no <SENTENCE-END>  farewell my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  farewell my desdemona ill come to thee straight <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  emilia come <SENTENCE-END>  be as your fancies teach you
    whateer you be i am obedient <SENTENCE-END> 
                                         exeunt desdemona and emilia <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  excellent wretch perdition catch my soul
    but i do love thee and when i love thee not
    chaos is come again <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  my noble lord
  othello <SENTENCE-END>              what dost thou say iago
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  did michael cassio when you wood my lady
    know of your love
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  he did from first to last <SENTENCE-END>  why dost thou ask
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  but for a satisfaction of my thought
    no further harm <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>            why of thy thought iago
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i did not think he had been acquainted with her <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o yes and went between us very oft <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  indeed  
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  indeed ay indeed <SENTENCE-END>  discernst thou aught in that
    is he not honest
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  honest my lord
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  honest ay honest <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  my lord for aught i know <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  what dost thou think
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  think my lord
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  think my lord by heaven he echoes me
    as if there were some monster in his thought
    too hideous to be shown <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost mean something <SENTENCE-END> 
    i heard thee say even now thou likest not that
    when cassio left my wife <SENTENCE-END>  what didst not like
    and when i told thee he was of my counsel
    in my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeed
    and didst contract and purse thy brow together
    as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
    some horrible conceit <SENTENCE-END>  if thou dost love me
    show me thy thought <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  my lord you know i love you <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                             i think thou dost  
    and for i know thourt full of love and honesty
    and weighst thy words before thou givest them breath
    therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
    for such things in a false disloyal knave
    are tricks of custom but in a man thats just
    theyre close dilations working from the heart
    that passion cannot rule <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                        for michael cassio
    i dare be sworn i think that he is honest <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  i think so too <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                     men should be what they seem
    or those that be not would they might seem none
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  certain men should be what they seem <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  why then i think cassios an honest man <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  nay yet theres more in this <SENTENCE-END> 
    i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
    as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
    the worst of words <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                  good my lord pardon me
    though i am bound to every act of duty  
    i am not bound to that all slaves are free to <SENTENCE-END> 
    utter my thoughts why say they are vile and false
    as wheres that palace whereinto foul things
    sometimes intrude not who has a breast so pure
    but some uncleanly apprehensions
    keep leets and lawdays and in session sit
    with meditations lawful
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost conspire against thy friend iago
    if thou but thinkst him wrongd and makest his ear
    a stranger to thy thoughts <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                          i do beseech you
    though i perchance am vicious in my guess
    as i confess it is my natures plague
    to spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
    shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet
    from one that so imperfectly conceits
    would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
    out of his scattering and unsure observance <SENTENCE-END> 
    it were not for your quiet nor your good
    nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom  
    to let you know my thoughts <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                        what dost thou mean
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  good name in man and woman dear my lord
    is the immediate jewel of their souls <SENTENCE-END> 
    who steals my purse steals trash tis something nothing
    twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
    but he that filches from me my good name
    robs me of that which not enriches him
    and makes me poor indeed <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven ill know thy thoughts <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  you cannot if my heart were in your hand
    nor shall not whilst tis in my custody <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  ha
  iago <SENTENCE-END>         o beware my lord of jealousy
    it is the greeneyed monster which doth mock
    the meat it feeds on <SENTENCE-END>  that cuckold lives in bliss
    who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
    but o what damned minutes tells he oer
    who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o misery  
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  poor and content is rich and rich enough
    but riches fineless is as poor as winter
    to him that ever fears he shall be poor <SENTENCE-END> 
    good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
    from jealousy
  othello <SENTENCE-END>          why why is this
    thinkst thou ild make a life of jealousy
    to follow still the changes of the moon
    with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt
    is once to be resolved <SENTENCE-END>  exchange me for a goat
    when i shall turn the business of my soul
    to such exsufflicate and blown surmises
    matching thy inference <SENTENCE-END>  tis not to make me jealous
    to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
    is free of speech sings plays and dances well
    where virtue is these are more virtuous <SENTENCE-END> 
    nor from mine own weak merits will i draw
    the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
    for she had eyes and chose me <SENTENCE-END>  no iago
    ill see before i doubt when i doubt prove  
    and on the proof there is no more but this
    away at once with love or jealousy
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i am glad of it for now i shall have reason
    to show the love and duty that i bear you
    with franker spirit <SENTENCE-END>  therefore as i am bound
    receive it from me <SENTENCE-END>  i speak not yet of proof <SENTENCE-END> 
    look to your wife observe her well with cassio
    wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure <SENTENCE-END> 
    i would not have your free and noble nature
    out of selfbounty be abused <SENTENCE-END>  look tot <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know our country disposition well
    in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
    they dare not show their husbands their best conscience
    is not to leavet undone but keept unknown <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou say so
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  she did deceive her father marrying you
    and when she seemd to shake and fear your looks
    she loved them most <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                and so she did <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                                   why go to then <SENTENCE-END>   
    she that so young could give out such a seeming
    to seel her fathers eyes up close as oak
    he thought twas witchcraft but i am much to blame
    i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
    for too much loving you <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                    i am bound to thee forever <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i see this hath a little dashd your spirits <SENTENCE-END>

  iago <SENTENCE-END>                           ifaith i fear it has <SENTENCE-END> 
    i hope you will consider what is spoke
    comes from my love <SENTENCE-END>  but i do see youre moved
    i am to pray you not to strain my speech
    to grosser issues nor to larger reach
    than to suspicion <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  i will not <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                 should you do so my lord
    my speech should fall into such vile success
    which my thoughts aim not at <SENTENCE-END>  cassios my worthy friend
    my lord i see youre moved <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                        no not much moved <SENTENCE-END>   
    i do not think but desdemonas honest <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  long live she so and long live you to think so
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  and yet how nature erring from itself
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  ay theres the point as to be bold with you
    not to affect many proposed matches
    of her own clime complexion and degree
    whereto we see in all things nature tends
    foh one may smell in such a will most rank
    foul disproportion thoughts unnatural <SENTENCE-END> 
    but pardon me <SENTENCE-END>  i do not in position
    distinctly speak of her though i may fear
    her will recoiling to her better judgement
    may fall to match you with her country forms
    and happily repent <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>               farewell farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
    if more thou dost perceive let me know more
    set on thy wife to observe <SENTENCE-END>  leave me iago <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  going <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i take my leave <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  why did i marry this honest creature doubtless
    sees and knows more much more than he unfolds <SENTENCE-END>   
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  returning <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i would i might entreat your honor
    to scan this thing no further leave it to time <SENTENCE-END> 
    though it be fit that cassio have his place
    for sure he fills it up with great ability
    yet if you please to hold him off awhile
    you shall by that perceive him and his means <SENTENCE-END> 
    note if your lady strain his entertainment
    with any strong or vehement importunity
    much will be seen in that <SENTENCE-END>  in the meantime
    let me be thought too busy in my fears
    as worthy cause i have to fear i am
    and hold her free i do beseech your honor <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  fear not my government <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i once more take my leave <SENTENCE-END>                               exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  this fellows of exceeding honesty
    and knows all qualities with a learned spirit
    of human dealings <SENTENCE-END>  if i do prove her haggard
    though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
    ild whistle her off and let her down the wind
    to prey at fortune <SENTENCE-END>  haply for i am black  
    and have not those soft parts of conversation
    that chamberers have or for i am declined
    into the vale of years yet thats not much
    shes gone <SENTENCE-END>  i am abused and my relief
    must be to loathe her <SENTENCE-END>  o curse of marriage
    that we can call these delicate creatures ours
    and not their appetites i had rather be a toad
    and live upon the vapor of a dungeon
    than keep a corner in the thing i love
    for others uses <SENTENCE-END>  yet tis the plague of great ones
    prerogatived are they less than the base
    tis destiny unshunnable like death <SENTENCE-END> 
    even then this forked plague is fated to us
    when we do quicken <SENTENCE-END>  desdemona comes

                    reenter desdemona and emilia <SENTENCE-END> 

    if she be false o then heaven mocks itself

  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  i am glad i have found this napkin
    this was her first remembrance from the moor <SENTENCE-END> 
    my wayward husband hath a hundred times
    wood me to steal it but she so loves the token

    that she reserves it evermore about her  
    to kiss and talk to <SENTENCE-END>  ill have the work taen out
    and givet iago <SENTENCE-END>  what he will do with it
    heaven knows not i

    that which so often you did bid me steal <SENTENCE-END>

    and let him find it <SENTENCE-END>  trifles light as air
    are to the jealous confirmations strong
    as proofs of holy writ this may do something <SENTENCE-END> 
    the moor already changes with my poison
    dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
    which at the first are scarce found to distaste
    but with a little act upon the blood
    burn like the mines of sulphur <SENTENCE-END>  i did say so <SENTENCE-END>   
    look where he comes

                          reenter othello <SENTENCE-END> 

                          not poppy nor mandragora
    nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
    shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    which thou owedst yesterday <SENTENCE-END>

  iago <SENTENCE-END>                           how now my lord

  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i am sorry to hear this <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  i had been happy if the general camp
    pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
    so i had nothing known <SENTENCE-END>  o now forever
    farewell the tranquil mind farewell content
    farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
    that make ambition virtue o farewell
    farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
    the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife
    the royal banner and all quality
    pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
    and o you mortal engines whose rude throats
    the immortal joves dread clamors counterfeit
    farewell othellos occupations gone
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  ist possible my lord
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
    be sure of it <SENTENCE-END>  give me the ocular proof
    or by the worth of mans eternal soul
    thou hadst been better have been born a dog
    than answer my waked wrath  
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                          ist come to this
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  make me to seet or at the least so prove it
    that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
    to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  my noble lord
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  if thou dost slander her and torture me
    never pray more abandon all remorse
    on horrors head horrors accumulate
    do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
    for nothing canst thou to damnation add
    greater than that <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                 o grace o heaven defend me
    are you a man have you a soul or sense
    god be wi you take mine office <SENTENCE-END>  o wretched fool
    that livest to make thine honesty a vice
    o monstrous world take note take note o world
    to be direct and honest is not safe <SENTENCE-END> 
    i thank you for this profit and from hence
    ill love no friend sith love breeds such offense <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  nay stay thou shouldst be honest <SENTENCE-END>   
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i should be wise for honestys a fool
    and loses that it works for <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                        by the world
    i think my wife be honest and think she is not
    i think that thou art just and think thou art not <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill have some proof <SENTENCE-END>  her name that was as fresh
    as dians visage is now begrimed and black
    as mine own face <SENTENCE-END>  if there be cords or knives
    poison or fire or suffocating streams
    ill not endure it <SENTENCE-END>  would i were satisfied
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i see sir you are eaten up with passion
    i do repent me that i put it to you <SENTENCE-END> 
    you would be satisfied
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                   would nay i will <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  and may <SENTENCE-END>  but how how satisfied my lord
    would you the supervisor grossly gape on
    behold her toppd
  othello <SENTENCE-END>              death and damnation o
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  it were a tedious difficulty i think
    to bring them to that prospect <SENTENCE-END>  damn them then  
    if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
    more than their own what then how then
    what shall i say wheres satisfaction
    it is impossible you should see this
    were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
    as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
    as ignorance made drunk <SENTENCE-END>  but yet i say
    if imputation and strong circumstances
    which lead directly to the door of truth
    will give you satisfaction you may havet <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  give me a living reason shes disloyal <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i do not like the office
    but sith i am enterd in this cause so far
    prickd tot by foolish honesty and love
    i will go on <SENTENCE-END>  i lay with cassio lately
    and being troubled with a raging tooth
    i could not sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
    there are a kind of men so loose of soul
    that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
    one of this kind is cassio <SENTENCE-END>   
    in sleep i heard him say sweet desdemona
    let us be wary let us hide our loves
    and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
    cry o sweet creature and then kiss me hard
    as if he pluckd up kisses by the roots
    that grew upon my lips then laid his leg
    over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then
    cried cursed fate that gave thee to the moor
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o monstrous monstrous
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                             nay this was but his dream <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  but this denoted a foregone conclusion <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  and this may help to thicken other proofs
    that do demonstrate thinly <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                       ill tear her all to pieces <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
    she may be honest yet <SENTENCE-END>  tell me but this
    have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
    spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  i gave her such a one twas my first gift <SENTENCE-END>   
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i know not that but such a handkerchief
    i am sure it was your wifes did i today
    see cassio wipe his beard with <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                           if it be that
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  if it be that or any that was hers
    it speaks against her with the other proofs <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o that the slave had forty thousand lives
    one is too poor too weak for my revenge <SENTENCE-END> 
    now do i see tis true <SENTENCE-END>  look here iago
    all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis gone <SENTENCE-END> 
    arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell
    yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne
    to tyrannous hate swell bosom with thy fraught
    for tis of aspics tongues
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                           yet be content <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o blood blood blood
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  patience i say your mind perhaps may change <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  never iago <SENTENCE-END>  like to the pontic sea
    whose icy current and compulsive course  
    neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
    to the propontic and the hellespont
    even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
    shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love
    till that a capable and wide revenge
    swallow them up <SENTENCE-END>  now by yond marble heaven
    in the due reverence of a sacred vow                      kneels <SENTENCE-END>

    witness you everburning lights above
    you elements that clip us round about
    witness that here iago doth give up
    the execution of his wit hands heart
    to wrongd othellos service let him command
    and to obey shall be in me remorse
    what bloody business ever <SENTENCE-END>                              they rise <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                      i greet thy love
    not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
    and will upon the instant put thee tot
    within these three days let me hear thee say

    come go with me apart i will withdraw
    to furnish me with some swift means of death
    for the fair devil <SENTENCE-END>  now art thou my lieutenant <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  i am your own forever <SENTENCE-END>                                 exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

    stabbing <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  go to where lodges he
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  can anything be made of this
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging
    and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own
    throat <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  can you inquire him out and be edified by report
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  i will catechize the world for him that is make questions

    lord on his behalf and hope all will be well <SENTENCE-END>

    i will attempt the doing it <SENTENCE-END>                                 exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  where should i lose that handkerchief emilia
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  i know not madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  believe me i had rather have lost my purse
    full of crusadoes and but my noble moor
    is true of mind and made of no such baseness
    as jealous creatures are it were enough
    to put him to ill thinking <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>                        is he not jealous
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  who he i think the sun where he was born
    drew all such humors from him <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>                           look where he comes <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i will not leave him now till cassio
    be calld to him <SENTENCE-END> 

                            enter othello <SENTENCE-END> 

                      how ist with you my lord
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  well my good lady <SENTENCE-END>  aside <SENTENCE-END>  o hardness to dissemble

  othello <SENTENCE-END>  give me your hand <SENTENCE-END>  this hand is moist my lady <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  it yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
    hot hot and moist <SENTENCE-END>  this hand of yours requires
    a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
    much castigation exercise devout
    for heres a young and sweating devil here
    that commonly rebels <SENTENCE-END>  tis a good hand
    a frank one <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  you may indeed say so
    for twas that hand that gave away my heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  a liberal hand <SENTENCE-END>  the hearts of old gave hands
    but our new heraldry is hands not hearts <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot speak of this <SENTENCE-END>  come now your promise <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  what promise chuck
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you <SENTENCE-END>

  othello <SENTENCE-END>  thats a fault <SENTENCE-END>  that handkerchief
    did an egyptian to my mother give
    she was a charmer and could almost read
    the thoughts of people <SENTENCE-END>  she told her while she kept it
    twould make her amiable and subdue my father
    entirely to her love but if she lost it
    or made a gift of it my fathers eye
    should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
    after new fancies <SENTENCE-END>  she dying gave it me
    and bid me when my fate would have me wive
    to give it her <SENTENCE-END>  i did so and take heed ont
    make it a darling like your precious eye
    to loset or givet away were such perdition
    as nothing else could match <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>                      ist possible
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  tis true theres magic in the web of it <SENTENCE-END>   
    a sibyl that had numberd in the world
    the sun to course two hundred compasses
    in her prophetic fury sewd the work
    the worms were hallowd that did breed the silk
    and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
    conserved of maidens hearts <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>                       indeed ist true
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  most veritable therefore look tot well <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  then would to god that i had never seent

    exist and be a member of his love
    whom i with all the office of my heart
    entirely honor <SENTENCE-END>  i would not be delayd <SENTENCE-END> 
    if my offense be of such mortal kind
    that nor my service past nor present sorrows
    nor purposed merit in futurity
    can ransom me into his love again
    but to know so must be my benefit
    so shall i clothe me in a forced content
    and shut myself up in some other course
    to fortunes alms <SENTENCE-END>   
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>            alas thricegentle cassio
    my advocation is not now in tune
    my lord is not my lord nor should i know him
    were he in favor as in humor alterd <SENTENCE-END> 
    so help me every spirit sanctified
    as i have spoken for you all my best
    and stood within the blank of his displeasure
    for my free speech you must awhile be patient <SENTENCE-END> 
    what i can do i will and more i will
    than for myself i dare <SENTENCE-END>  let that suffice you <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  is my lord angry
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>                  he went hence but now
    and certainly in strange unquietness <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  can he be angry i have seen the cannon
    when it hath blown his ranks into the air
    and like the devil from his very arm
    puffd his own brother <SENTENCE-END>  and can he be angry
    something of moment then <SENTENCE-END>  i will go meet him <SENTENCE-END> 
    theres matter int indeed if he be angry <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i prithee do so <SENTENCE-END>                              exit iago <SENTENCE-END>   
                               something sure of state
    either from venice or some unhatchd practice
    made demonstrable here in cyprus to him
    hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
    mens natures wrangle with inferior things
    though great ones are their object <SENTENCE-END>  tis even so
    for let our finger ache and it indues
    our other healthful members even to that sense
    of pain <SENTENCE-END>  nay we must think men are not gods
    nor of them look for such observancy
    as fits the bridal <SENTENCE-END>  beshrew me much emilia
    i was unhandsome warrior as i am
    arraigning his unkindness with my soul
    but now i find i had subornd the witness
    and hes indicted falsely <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  pray heaven it be state matters as you think
    and no conception nor no jealous toy
    concerning you <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  alas the day i never gave him cause
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  but jealous souls will not be answerd so  
    they are not ever jealous for the cause
    but jealous for they are jealous <SENTENCE-END>  tis a monster
    begot upon itself born on itself <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  heaven keep that monster from othellos mind
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  lady amen <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i will go seek him <SENTENCE-END>  cassio walk hereabout <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i do find him fit ill move your suit
    and seek to effect it to my uttermost <SENTENCE-END>

  iago <SENTENCE-END>  or to be naked with her friend in bed
    an hour or more not meaning any harm
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  naked in bed iago and not mean harm

    they that mean virtuously and yet do so
    the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven <SENTENCE-END>

    convinced or supplied them cannot choose
    but they must blab
  othello <SENTENCE-END>               hath he said anything

    if not he foams at mouth and by and by

    do you withdraw yourself a little while
    he will recover straight <SENTENCE-END>  when he is gone
    i would on great occasion speak with you <SENTENCE-END>             exit cassio <SENTENCE-END> 
    how is it general have you not hurt your head
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou mock me
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                        i mock you no by heaven <SENTENCE-END> 
    would you would bear your fortune like a man
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  a horned mans a monster and a beast <SENTENCE-END>   
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  theres many a beast then in a populous city
    and many a civil monster <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  did he confess it
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                        good sir be a man

    that nightly lie in those unproper beds
    which they dare swear peculiar <SENTENCE-END>  your case is better <SENTENCE-END> 
    o tis the spite of hell the fiends archmock
    to lip a wanton in a secure couch
    and to suppose her chaste no let me know
    and knowing what i am i know what she shall be <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o thou art wise tis certain <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                                     stand you awhile apart
    confine yourself but in a patient list <SENTENCE-END> 
    whilst you were here oerwhelmed with your grief
    a passion most unsuiting such a man
    cassio came hither <SENTENCE-END>  i shifted him away
    and laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
    bade him anon return and here speak with me  
    the which he promised <SENTENCE-END>  do but encave yourself
    and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
    that dwell in every region of his face
    for i will make him tell the tale anew
    where how how oft how long ago and when
    he hath and is again to cope your wife <SENTENCE-END> 
    i say but mark his gesture <SENTENCE-END>  marry patience
    or i shall say you are all in all in spleen
    and nothing of a man <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                 dost thou hear iago
    i will be found most cunning in my patience
    but dost thou hear most bloody <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>                                 thats not amiss
    but yet keep time in all <SENTENCE-END>  will you withdraw
                                                     othello retires <SENTENCE-END> 
    now will i question cassio of bianca
    a housewife that by selling her desires
    buys herself bread and clothes <SENTENCE-END>  it is a creature
    that dotes on cassio as tis the strumpets plague
    to beguile many and be beguiled by one <SENTENCE-END>   
    he when he hears of her cannot refrain
    from the excess of laughter <SENTENCE-END>  here he comes <SENTENCE-END> 

                           reenter cassio <SENTENCE-END> 

    as he shall smile othello shall go mad
    and his unbookish jealousy must construe
    poor cassios smiles gestures and light behavior
    quite in the wrong <SENTENCE-END>  how do you now lieutenant
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  the worser that you give me the addition
    whose want even kills me <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  ply desdemona well and you are sure ont <SENTENCE-END>

  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  alas poor rogue i think ifaith she loves me <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  now he denies it faintly and laughs it out <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  do you hear cassio

    let heaven requite it with the serpents curse  
    for if she be not honest chaste and true
    theres no man happy the purest of their wives

  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o desdemona away away away
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  alas the heavy day why do you weep
    am i the motive of these tears my lord

    an instrument of this your calling back
    lay not your blame on me <SENTENCE-END>  if you have lost him
    why i have lost him too <SENTENCE-END>   
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                     had it pleased heaven
    to try me with affliction had they raind
    all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
    steepd me in poverty to the very lips
    given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
    i should have found in some place of my soul
    a drop of patience but alas to make me
    a fixed figure for the time of scorn
    to point his slow unmoving finger at
    yet could i bear that too well very well
    but there where i have garnerd up my heart
    where either i must live or bear no life
    the fountain from the which my current runs
    or else dries up to be discarded thence
    or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
    to knot and gender in turn thy complexion there
    patience thou young and roselippd cherubin
    ay there look grim as hell
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i hope my noble lord esteems me honest <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o ay as summer flies are in the shambles  
    that quicken even with blowing <SENTENCE-END>  o thou weed
    who art so lovely fair and smellst so sweet
    that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst neer been born
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  alas what ignorant sin have i committed
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  was this fair paper this most goodly book
    made to write whore upon what committed
    committed o thou public commoner
    i should make very forges of my cheeks
    that would to cinders burn up modesty
    did i but speak thy deeds <SENTENCE-END>  what committed
    heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
    the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
    is hushd within the hollow mine of earth
    and will not hear it <SENTENCE-END>  what committed
    impudent strumpet
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>            by heaven you do me wrong <SENTENCE-END>

    than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope <SENTENCE-END>  i will indeed
    no longer endure it nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace
    what already i have foolishly suffered <SENTENCE-END> 
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  will you hear me roderigo
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  faith i have heard too much for your words and  
    performances are no kin together <SENTENCE-END>

    exception but yet i protest have dealt most directly in thy
    affair <SENTENCE-END>

    fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some
    accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
    cassio <SENTENCE-END>   
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  how do you mean removing of him
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  why by making him uncapable of othellos place knocking out

  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  and that you would have me to do
  iago <SENTENCE-END>  ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right <SENTENCE-END>  he sups
    tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him <SENTENCE-END>  he knows

    necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
    it on him <SENTENCE-END>  it is now high suppertime and the night grows to
    waste <SENTENCE-END>  about it <SENTENCE-END> 
  roderigo <SENTENCE-END>  i will hear further reason for this <SENTENCE-END>

  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i have heard it said so <SENTENCE-END>  o these men these men
    dost thou in conscience think tell me emilia
    that there be women do abuse their husbands
    in such gross kind
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>                there be some such no question <SENTENCE-END>   
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  why would not you
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>                   no by this heavenly light
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  nor i neither by this heavenly light i might dot as well
    i the dark <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  the worlds a huge thing it is a great price
    for a small vice <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>           in troth i think thou wouldst not <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  in troth i think i should and undot when i had done <SENTENCE-END> 
    marry i would not do such a thing for a jointring nor for
    measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any
    petty exhibition but for the whole world why who would not
    make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch i should
    venture purgatory fort <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  beshrew me if i would do such a wrong
    for the whole world <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  why the wrong is but a wrong i the world and having the
    world for your labor tis a wrong in your own world and you
    might quickly make it right <SENTENCE-END>   
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  i do not think there is any such woman <SENTENCE-END> 
  emilia <SENTENCE-END>  yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the
      world they played for <SENTENCE-END> 
    but i do think it is their husbands faults
    if wives do fall say that they slack their duties
    and pour our treasures into foreign laps
    or else break out in peevish jealousies
    throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
    or scant our former having in despite
    why we have galls and though we have some grace
    yet have we some revenge <SENTENCE-END>  let husbands know
    their wives have sense like them they see and smell
    and have their palates both for sweet and sour
    as husbands have <SENTENCE-END>  what is it that they do
    when they change us for others is it sport
    i think it is <SENTENCE-END>  and doth affection breed it
    i think it doth <SENTENCE-END>  ist frailty that thus errs
    it is so too <SENTENCE-END>  and have not we affections
    desires for sport and frailty as men have
    then let them use us well else let them know  
    the ills we do their ills instruct us so <SENTENCE-END> 
  desdemona <SENTENCE-END>  good night good night <SENTENCE-END>  heaven me such uses send
    not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend                exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

    which as i think you know not <SENTENCE-END>  here is a letter
    found in the pocket of the slain roderigo
    and here another <SENTENCE-END>  the one of them imports
    the death of cassio to be undertook
    by roderigo <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  o villain
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>              most heathenish and most gross
  lodovico <SENTENCE-END>  now heres another discontented paper
    found in his pocket too and this it seems  
    roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
    but that belike iago in the interim
    came in and satisfied him <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                      o the pernicious caitiff
    how came you cassio by that handkerchief
    that was my wifes
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>                i found it in my chamber
    and he himself confessd but even now
    that there he droppd it for a special purpose
    which wrought to his desire <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>                        o fool fool fool
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  there is besides in roderigos letter
    how he upbraids iago that he made him
    brave me upon the watch whereon it came
    that i was cast <SENTENCE-END>  and even but now he spake
    after long seeming dead iago hurt him
    iago set him on <SENTENCE-END> 
  lodovico <SENTENCE-END>  you must forsake this room and go with us <SENTENCE-END> 
    your power and your command is taken off
    and cassio rules in cyprus <SENTENCE-END>  for this slave  
    if there be any cunning cruelty
    that can torment him much and hold him long
    it shall be his <SENTENCE-END>  you shall close prisoner rest
    till that the nature of your fault be known
    to the venetian state <SENTENCE-END>  come bring away <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  soft you a word or two before you go <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have done the state some service and they knowt <SENTENCE-END> 
    no more of that <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you in your letters
    when you shall these unlucky deeds relate
    speak of me as i am nothing extenuate
    nor set down aught in malice <SENTENCE-END>  then must you speak
    of one that loved not wisely but too well
    of one not easily jealous but being wrought
    perplexd in the extreme of one whose hand
    like the base indian threw a pearl away
    richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
    albeit unused to the melting mood
    drop tears as fast as the arabian trees
    their medicinal gum <SENTENCE-END>  set you down this
    and say besides that in aleppo once  
    where a malignant and a turband turk
    beat a venetian and traduced the state
    i took by the throat the circumcised dog
    and smote him thus <SENTENCE-END>                                stabs himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  lodovico <SENTENCE-END>  o bloody period
  gratiano <SENTENCE-END>                   all thats spoke is marrd <SENTENCE-END> 
  othello <SENTENCE-END>  i kissd thee ere i killd thee <SENTENCE-END>  no way but this
    killing myself to die upon a kiss <SENTENCE-END> 
                                          falls on the bed and dies <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassio <SENTENCE-END>  this did i fear but thought he had no weapon
    for he was great of heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  lodovico <SENTENCE-END>          to iago <SENTENCE-END>  o spartan dog
    more fell than anguish hunger or the sea
    look on the tragic loading of this bed
    this is thy work <SENTENCE-END>  the object poisons sight
    let it be hid <SENTENCE-END>  gratiano keep the house
    and seize upon the fortunes of the moor
    for they succeed on you <SENTENCE-END>  to you lord governor
    remains the censure of this hellish villain
    the time the place the torture <SENTENCE-END>  o enforce it  
    myself will straight aboard and to the state
    this heavy act with heavy heart relate <SENTENCE-END>                    exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

london <SENTENCE-END>  the palace

enter richard john of gaunt with other nobles and attendants

  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  old john of gaunt timehonoured lancaster
    hast thou according to thy oath and band
    brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
    here to make good the boistrous late appeal
    which then our leisure would not let us hear
    against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  i have my liege <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
    if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
    or worthily as a good subject should
    on some known ground of treachery in him
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  as near as i could sift him on that argument
    on some apparent danger seen in him
    aimd at your highnessno inveterate malice <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  then call them to our presence face to face
    and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear  
    the accuser and the accused freely speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    highstomachd are they both and full of ire
    in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire <SENTENCE-END> 

         enter bolingbroke and mowbray

  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  many years of happy days befall
    my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  each day still better others happiness
    until the heavens envying earths good hap
    add an immortal title to your crown
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  we thank you both yet one but flatters us
    as well appeareth by the cause you come
    namely to appeal each other of high treason <SENTENCE-END> 
    cousin of hereford what dost thou object
    against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  firstheaven be the record to my speech
    in the devotion of a subjects love
    tendring the precious safety of my prince
    and free from other misbegotten hate  
    come i appellant to this princely presence <SENTENCE-END> 
    now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee
    and mark my greeting well for what i speak
    my body shall make good upon this earth
    or my divine soul answer it in heaven
    thou art a traitor and a miscreant
    too good to be so and too bad to live
    since the more fair and crystal is the sky
    the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly <SENTENCE-END> 
    once more the more to aggravate the note
    with a foul traitors name stuff i thy throat
    and wishso please my sovereignere i move
    what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  let not my cold words here accuse my zeal <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis not the trial of a womans war
    the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
    can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
    the blood is hot that must be coold for this <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet can i not of such tame patience boast
    as to be hushd and nought at an to say <SENTENCE-END>   
    first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
    from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
    which else would post until it had returnd
    these terms of treason doubled down his throat <SENTENCE-END> 
    setting aside his high bloods royalty
    and let him be no kinsman to my liege
    i do defy him and i spit at him
    call him a slanderous coward and a villain
    which to maintain i would allow him odds
    and meet him were i tied to run afoot
    even to the frozen ridges of the alps
    or any other ground inhabitable
    where ever englishman durst set his foot <SENTENCE-END> 
    meantime let this defend my loyalty
    by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  pale trembling coward there i throw my gage
    disclaiming here the kindred of the king
    and lay aside my high bloods royalty
    which fear not reverence makes thee to except <SENTENCE-END> 
    if guilty dread have left thee so much strength  
    as to take up mine honours pawn then stoop <SENTENCE-END> 
    by that and all the rites of knighthood else
    will i make good against thee arm to arm
    what i have spoke or thou canst worst devise <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  i take it up and by that sword i swear
    which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
    ill answer thee in any fair degree
    or chivalrous design of knightly trial
    and when i mount alive may i not light
    if i be traitor or unjustly fight
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  what doth our cousin lay to mowbrays charge
    it must be great that can inherit us
    so much as of a thought of ill in him <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  look what i speak my life shall prove it true
    that mowbray hath receivd eight thousand nobles
    in name of lendings for your highness soldiers
    the which he hath detaind for lewd employments
    like a false traitor and injurious villain <SENTENCE-END> 
    besides i say and will in battle prove
    or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge  
    that ever was surveyd by english eye
    that all the treasons for these eighteen years
    complotted and contrived in this land
    fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring <SENTENCE-END> 
    further i say and further will maintain
    upon his bad life to make all this good
    that he did plot the duke of gloucesters death
    suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
    and consequently like a traitor coward
    sluicd out his innocent soul through streams of blood
    which blood like sacrificing abels cries
    even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
    to me for justice and rough chastisement
    and by the glorious worth of my descent
    this arm shall do it or this life be spent <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  how high a pitch his resolution soars
    thomas of norfolk what sayst thou to this
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  o let my sovereign turn away his face
    and bid his ears a little while be deaf
    till i have told this slander of his blood  
    how god and good men hate so foul a liar <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  mowbray impartial are our eyes and cars <SENTENCE-END> 
    were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir
    as he is but my fathers brothers son
    now by my sceptres awe i make a vow
    such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
    should nothing privilege him nor partialize
    the unstooping firmness of my upright soul <SENTENCE-END> 
    he is our subject mowbray so art thou
    free speech and fearless i to thee allow <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
    through the false passage of thy throat thou liest <SENTENCE-END> 
    three parts of that receipt i had for calais
    disbursd i duly to his highness soldiers
    the other part reservd i by consent
    for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
    upon remainder of a dear account
    since last i went to france to fetch his queen
    now swallow down that lie <SENTENCE-END>  for gloucesters death
    i slew him not but to my own disgrace  
    neglected my sworn duty in that case <SENTENCE-END> 
    for you my noble lord of lancaster
    the honourable father to my foe
    once did i lay an ambush for your life
    a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
    but ere i last receivd the sacrament
    i did confess it and exactly beggd
    your graces pardon and i hope i had it <SENTENCE-END> 
    this is my fault <SENTENCE-END>  as for the rest appeald
    it issues from the rancour of a villain
    a recreant and most degenerate traitor
    which in myself i boldly will defend
    and interchangeably hurl down my gage
    upon this overweening traitors foot
    to prove myself a loyal gentleman
    even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom <SENTENCE-END> 
    in haste whereof most heartily i pray
    your highness to assign our trial day <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  wrathkindled gentlemen be ruld by me
    lets purge this choler without letting blood  
    this we prescribe though no physician
    deep malice makes too deep incision <SENTENCE-END> 
    forget forgive conclude and be agreed
    our doctors say this is no month to bleed <SENTENCE-END> 
    good uncle let this end where it begun
    well calm the duke of norfolk you your son <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  to be a makepeace shall become my age <SENTENCE-END> 
    throw down my son the duke of norfolks gage <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  and norfolk throw down his <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  when harry when
    obedience bids i should not bid again <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  norfolk throw down we bid <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is no boot <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
    my life thou shalt command but not my shame
    the one my duty owes but my fair name
    despite of death that lives upon my grave
    to dark dishonours use thou shalt not have <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am disgracd impeachd and baffld here
    piercd to the soul with slanders venomd spear  
    the which no balm can cure but his heartblood
    which breathd this poison <SENTENCE-END>

  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  yea but not change his spots <SENTENCE-END>  take but my shame
    and i resign my gage <SENTENCE-END>  my dear dear lord
    the purest treasure mortal times afford
    is spotless reputation that away
    men are but gilded loam or painted clay <SENTENCE-END> 
    a jewel in a tentimes barrdup chest
    is a bold spirit in a loyal breast <SENTENCE-END> 
    mine honour is my life both grow in one
    take honour from me and my life is done

    in that i live and for that will i die <SENTENCE-END>

    shall i seem crestfallen in my fathers sight
    or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
    before this outdard dastard ere my tongue  
    shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
    or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
    the slavish motive of recanting fear
    and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
    where shame doth harbour even in mowbrays face <SENTENCE-END>

london <SENTENCE-END>  the duke of lancasters palace

enter john of gaunt with the duchess of gloucester

  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  alas the part i had in woodstocks blood
    doth more solicit me than your exclaims
    to stir against the butchers of his life
    but since correction lieth in those hands
    which made the fault that we cannot correct
    put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
    who when they see the hours ripe on earth
    will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads <SENTENCE-END> 
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
    hath love in thy old blood no living fire
    edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one
    were as seven vials of his sacred blood
    or seven fair branches springing from one root <SENTENCE-END> 
    some of those seven are dried by natures course
    some of those branches by the destinies cut
    but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester
    one vial full of edwards sacred blood  
    one flourishing branch of his most royal root
    is crackd and all the precious liquor spilt
    is hackd down and his summer leaves all faded
    by envys hand and murders bloody axe <SENTENCE-END> 
    ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
    that mettle that self mould that fashiond thee
    made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
    yet art thou slain in him <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost consent
    in some large measure to thy fathers death
    in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
    who was the model of thy fathers life <SENTENCE-END> 
    call it not patience gauntit is despair
    in suffring thus thy brother to be slaughtred
    thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
    teaching stern murder how to butcher thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    that which in mean men we entitle patience
    is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts <SENTENCE-END> 
    what shall i say to safeguard thine own life
    the best way is to venge my gloucesters death <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  gods is the quarrel for gods substitute  
    his deputy anointed in his sight
    hath causd his death the which if wrongfully
    let heaven revenge for i may never lift
    an angry arm against his minister <SENTENCE-END> 
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  where then alas may i complain myself
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  to god the widows champion and defence <SENTENCE-END> 
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  why then i will <SENTENCE-END>  farewell old gaunt <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou goest to coventry there to behold
    our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight <SENTENCE-END> 
    o sit my husbands wrongs on herefords spear
    that it may enter butcher mowbrays breast
    or if misfortune miss the first career
    be mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom
    that they may break his foaming coursers back
    and throw the rider headlong in the lists
    a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
    farewell old gaunt thy sometimes brothers wife
    with her companion grief must end her life <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  sister farewell i must to coventry <SENTENCE-END> 
    as much good stay with thee as go with me  
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls
    not with the empty hollowness but weight <SENTENCE-END> 
    i take my leave before i have begun
    for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done <SENTENCE-END> 
    commend me to thy brother edmund york <SENTENCE-END> 
    lo this is all nay yet depart not so
    though this be all do not so quickly go
    i shall remember more <SENTENCE-END>  bid him ah what
    with all good speed at plashy visit me <SENTENCE-END> 
    alack and what shall good old york there see
    but empty lodgings and unfurnishd walls
    unpeopled offices untrodden stones
    and what hear there for welcome but my groans
    therefore commend me let him not come there
    to seek out sorrow that dwells every where <SENTENCE-END> 
    desolate desolate will i hence and die
    the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye <SENTENCE-END>           exeunt

    draw near
    and list what with our council we have done <SENTENCE-END> 
    for that our kingdoms earth should not be soild
    with that dear blood which it hath fostered
    and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
    of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours sword
    and for we think the eaglewinged pride
    of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
    with rivalhating envy set on you
    to wake our peace which in our countrys cradle
    draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
    which so rousd up with boistrous untund drums
    with harshresounding trumpets dreadful bray
    and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
    might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
    and make us wade even in our kindreds blood
    therefore we banish you our territories <SENTENCE-END> 
    you cousin hereford upon pain of life
    till twice five summers have enrichd our fields
    shall not regreet our fair dominions  
    but tread the stranger paths of banishment <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  your will be done <SENTENCE-END>  this must my comfort be
    that sun that warms you here shall shine on me
    and those his golden beams to you here lent
    shall point on me and gild my banishment <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
    which i with some unwillingness pronounce
    the sly slow hours shall not determinate
    the dateless limit of thy dear exile
    the hopeless word of never to return
    breathe i against thee upon pain of life <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
    and all unlookd for from your highness mouth <SENTENCE-END> 
    a dearer merit not so deep a maim
    as to be cast forth in the common air
    have i deserved at your highness hands <SENTENCE-END> 
    the language i have learnt these forty years
    my native english now i must forgo
    and now my tongues use is to me no more
    than an unstringed viol or a harp  
    or like a cunning instrument casd up
    or being open put into his hands
    that knows no touch to tune the harmony <SENTENCE-END> 
    within my mouth you have engaold my tongue
    doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips
    and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
    is made my gaoler to attend on me <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am too old to fawn upon a nurse
    too far in years to be a pupil now <SENTENCE-END> 
    what is thy sentence then but speechless death
    which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  it boots thee not to be compassionate
    after our sentence plaining comes too late <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  then thus i turn me from my countrvs light
    to dwell in solemn shades of endless night <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  return again and take an oath with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    lay on our royal sword your banishd hands
    swear by the duty that you owe to god
    our part therein we banish with yourselves
    to keep the oath that we administer  
    you never shall so help you truth and god
    embrace each others love in banishment
    nor never look upon each others face
    nor never write regreet nor reconcile
    this louring tempest of your homebred hate
    nor never by advised purpose meet
    to plot contrive or complot any ill
    gainst us our state our subjects or our land <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  i swear <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  and i to keep all this <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  norfolk so far as to mine enemy <SENTENCE-END> 
    by this time had the king permitted us
    one of our souls had wandred in the air
    banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
    as now our flesh is banishd from this land
    confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
    since thou hast far to go bear not along
    the clogging burden of a guilty soul <SENTENCE-END> 
  mowbray <SENTENCE-END>  no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor
    my name be blotted from the book of life  
    and i from heaven banishd as from hence
    but what thou art god thou and i do know
    and all too soon i fear the king shall rue <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell my liege <SENTENCE-END>  now no way can i stray
    save back to england an the worlds my way <SENTENCE-END>             exit
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
    i see thy grieved heart <SENTENCE-END>  thy sad aspect
    hath from the number of his banishd years
    pluckd four away <SENTENCE-END>  to bolingbroke six frozen winters spent
    return with welcome home from banishment <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  how long a time lies in one little word
    four lagging winters and four wanton springs
    end in a word such is the breath of kings <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  i thank my liege that in regard of me
    he shortens four years of my sons exile
    but little vantage shall i reap thereby
    for ere the six years that he hath to spend
    can change their moons and bring their times about
    my oildried lamp and timebewasted light
    shall be extinct with age and endless night  
    my inch of taper will be burnt and done
    and blindfold death not let me see my son <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  why uncle thou hast many years to live <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  but not a minute king that thou canst give
    shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
    and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
    thou canst help time to furrow me with age
    but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
    thy word is current with him for my death
    but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  thy son is banishd upon good advice
    whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave <SENTENCE-END> 
    why at our justice seemst thou then to lour
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour <SENTENCE-END> 
    you urgd me as a judge but i had rather
    you would have bid me argue like a father <SENTENCE-END> 
    o had it been a stranger not my child
    to smooth his fault i should have been more mild <SENTENCE-END> 
    a partial slander sought i to avoid
    and in the sentence my own life destroyd <SENTENCE-END>   
    alas i lookd when some of you should say
    i was too strict to make mine own away
    but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
    against my will to do myself this wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  cousin farewell and uncle bid him so <SENTENCE-END> 
    six years we banish him and he shall go <SENTENCE-END> 
                                  flourish <SENTENCE-END>  exit king with train
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  cousin farewell what presence must not know
    from where you do remain let paper show <SENTENCE-END> 
  marshal <SENTENCE-END>  my lord no leave take i for i will ride
    as far as land will let me by your side <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
    that thou returnest no greeting to thy friends
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  i have too few to take my leave of you
    when the tongues office should be prodigal
    to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  thy grief is but thy absence for a time <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  joy absent grief is present for that time <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  what is six winters they are quickly gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten <SENTENCE-END>   
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  call it a travel that thou takst for pleasure <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  my heart will sigh when i miscall it so
    which finds it an enforced pilgrimage <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  the sullen passage of thy weary steps
    esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
    the precious jewel of thy home return <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  nay rather every tedious stride i make
    will but remember me what a deal of world
    i wander from the jewels that i love <SENTENCE-END> 
    must i not serve a long apprenticehood
    to foreign passages and in the end
    having my freedom boast of nothing else
    but that i was a journeyman to grief
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  all places that the eye of heaven visits
    are to a wise man ports and happy havens <SENTENCE-END> 
    teach thy necessity to reason thus
    there is no virtue like necessity <SENTENCE-END> 
    think not the king did banish thee
    but thou the king <SENTENCE-END>  woe doth the heavier sit
    where it perceives it is but faintly home <SENTENCE-END>   
    go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
    and not the king exild thee or suppose
    devouring pestilence hangs in our air
    and thou art flying to a fresher clime <SENTENCE-END> 
    look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
    to lie that way thou goest not whence thou comst <SENTENCE-END> 
    suppose the singing birds musicians
    the grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd
    the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
    than a delightful measure or a dance
    for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
    the man that mocks at it and sets it light <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  o who can hold a fire in his hand
    by thinking on the frosty caucasus
    or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
    by bare imagination of a feast
    or wallow naked in december snow
    by thinking on fantastic summers heat
    o no the apprehension of the good
    gives but the greater feeling to the worse <SENTENCE-END>   
    fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more
    than when he bites but lanceth not the sore <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  come come my son ill bring thee on thy way <SENTENCE-END> 
    had i thy youtli and cause i would not stay <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  then englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu
    my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
    whereer i wander boast of this i can
    though banishd yet a trueborn english man <SENTENCE-END>           exeunt

    but to the next high way and there i left him <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  and say what store of parting tears were shed
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  faith none for me except the northeast wind
    which then blew bitterly against our faces
    awakd the sleeping rheum and so by chance
    did grace our hollow parting with a tear <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  what said our cousin when you parted with him
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
    and for my heart disdained that my tongue
    should so profane the word that taught me craft
    to counterfeit oppression of such grief
    that words seemd buried in my sorrows grave <SENTENCE-END> 
    marry would the word farewell have lengthned hours  
    and added years to his short banishment
    he should have had a volume of farewells
    but since it would not he had none of me <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
    when time shall call him home from banishment
    whether our kinsman come to see his friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    ourself and bushy bagot here and green
    observd his courtship to the common people
    how he did seem to dive into their hearts
    with humble and familiar courtesy
    what reverence he did throw away on slaves
    wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
    and patient underbearing of his fortune
    as twere to banish their affects with him <SENTENCE-END> 
    off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
    a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
    and had the tribute of his supple knee

    for our affairs in hand <SENTENCE-END>  if that come short
    our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
    whereto when they shall know what men are rich
    they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
    and send them after to supply our wants

act ii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
london <SENTENCE-END>  ely house

enter john of gaunt sick with the duke of york etc <SENTENCE-END> 

  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  will the king come that i may breathe my last
    in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
  york <SENTENCE-END>  vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
    for all in vain comes counsel to his ear <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  o but they say the tongues of dying men
    enforce attention like deep harmony <SENTENCE-END> 
    where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
    for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain <SENTENCE-END> 
    he that no more must say is listend more
    than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
    more are mens ends markd than their lives before <SENTENCE-END> 
    the setting sun and music at the close
    as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
    writ in remembrance more than things long past <SENTENCE-END> 
    though richard my lifes counsel would not hear
    my deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  no it is stoppd with other flattering sounds  
    as praises of whose taste the wise are fond
    lascivious metres to whose venom sound
    the open ear of youth doth always listen
    report of fashions in proud italy
    whose manners still our tardy apish nation
    limps after in base imitation <SENTENCE-END> 
    where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
    so it be new theres no respect how vile
    that is not quickly buzzd into his ears
    then all too late comes counsel to be heard
    where will doth mutiny with wits regard <SENTENCE-END> 
    direct not him whose way himself will choose <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  methinks i am a prophet new inspird
    and thus expiring do foretell of him
    his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
    for violent fires soon burn out themselves
    small showers last long but sudden storms are short
    he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
    with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder  
    light vanity insatiate cormorant
    consuming means soon preys upon itself <SENTENCE-END> 
    this royal throne of kings this sceptred isle
    this earth of majesty this seat of mars
    this other eden demiparadise
    this fortress built by nature for herself
    against infection and the hand of war
    this happy breed of men this little world
    this precious stone set in the silver sea
    which serves it in the office of a wall
    or as a moat defensive to a house
    against the envy of less happier lands
    this blessed plot this earth this realm this england
    this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
    feard by their breed and famous by their birth
    renowned for their deeds as far from home
    for christian service and true chivalry
    as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry
    of the worlds ransom blessed marys son
    this land of such dear souls this dear dear land  
    dear for her reputation through the world
    is now leasd outi die pronouncing it
    like to a tenement or pelting farm <SENTENCE-END> 
    england bound in with the triumphant sea
    whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
    of watry neptune is now bound in with shame
    with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
    that england that was wont to conquer others
    hath made a shameful conquest of itself <SENTENCE-END> 
    ah would the scandal vanish with my life
    how happy then were my ensuing death

    enter king and queen aumerle bushy green bagot

    the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
    is my strict fasti mean my childrens looks
    and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt <SENTENCE-END> 
    gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave
    whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  can sick men play so nicely with their names
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  no misery makes sport to mock itself
    since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
    i mock my name great king to flatter thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  should dying men flatter with those that live
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  no no men living flatter those that die <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  thou now adying sayest thou flatterest me <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  o no thou diest though i the sicker be <SENTENCE-END>

    ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill <SENTENCE-END> 
    thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
    wherein thou liest in reputation sick
    and thou too careless patient as thou art
    commitst thy anointed body to the cure
    of those physicians that first wounded thee
    a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
    whose compass is no bigger than thy head
    and yet incaged in so small a verge
    the waste is no whit lesser than thy land <SENTENCE-END> 
    o had thy grandsire with a prophets eye
    seen how his sons son should destroy his sons
    from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
    deposing thee before thou wert possessd
    which art possessd now to depose thyself <SENTENCE-END> 
    why cousin wert thou regent of the world
    it were a shame to let this land by lease
    but for thy world enjoying but this land
    is it not more than shame to shame it so
    landlord of england art thou now not king <SENTENCE-END>   
    thy state of law is bondslave to the law
    and thou
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  a lunatic leanwitted fool
    presuming on an agues privilege
    darest with thy frozen admonition
    make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
    with fury from his native residence <SENTENCE-END> 
    now by my seats right royal majesty
    wert thou not brother to great edwards son
    this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
    should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders <SENTENCE-END> 
  gaunt <SENTENCE-END>  o spare me not my brother edwards son
    for that i was his father edwards son
    that blood already like the pelican
    hast thou tappd out and drunkenly carousd <SENTENCE-END> 
    my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
    whom fair befall in heaven mongst happy souls
    may be a precedent and witness good
    that thou respectst not spilling edwards blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    join with the present sickness that i have  
    and thy unkindness be like crooked age
    to crop at once a too long withered flower <SENTENCE-END> 
    live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
    these words hereafter thy tormentors be
    convey me to my bed then to my grave <SENTENCE-END> 
    love they to live that love and honour have <SENTENCE-END> 
                               exit borne out by his attendants

    for both hast thou and both become the grave <SENTENCE-END>

    to wayward sickliness and age in him <SENTENCE-END>

    or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am the last of noble edwards sons
    of whom thy father prince of wales was first <SENTENCE-END>

    his face thou hast for even so lookd he
    accomplishd with the number of thy hours
    but when he frownd it was against the french
    and not against his friends <SENTENCE-END>  his noble hand
    did win what he did spend and spent not that
    which his triumphant fathers hand had won <SENTENCE-END> 
    his hands were guilty of no kindred blood

    and shortly mean to touch our northern shore <SENTENCE-END> 
    perhaps they had ere this but that they stay

    redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown
    wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt
    and make high majesty look like itself

    and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
    making the hard way sweet and delectable <SENTENCE-END> 
    but i bethink me what a weary way
    from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
    in ross and willoughby wanting your company
    which i protest hath very much beguild
    the tediousness and process of my travel <SENTENCE-END> 
    but theirs is sweetned with the hope to have
    the present benefit which i possess
    and hope to joy is little less in joy
    than hope enjoyd <SENTENCE-END>  by this the weary lords
    shall make their way seem short as mine hath done  
    by sight of what i have your noble company <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  of much less value is my company
    than your good words <SENTENCE-END>  but who comes here

    broken his staff of office and dispersd
    the household of the king <SENTENCE-END> 
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  what was his reason
    he was not so resolvd when last we spake together <SENTENCE-END> 
  percy <SENTENCE-END>  because your lordship was proclaimed traitor <SENTENCE-END> 
    but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh
    to offer service to the duke of hereford
    and sent me over by berkeley to discover  
    what power the duke of york had levied there

  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
    i count myself in nothing else so happy
    as in a soul remembring my good friends
    and as my fortune ripens with thy love
    it shall be still thy true loves recompense <SENTENCE-END> 
    my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it <SENTENCE-END>

    and i am come to seek that name in england
    and i must find that title in your tongue
    before i make reply to aught you say <SENTENCE-END> 
  berkeley <SENTENCE-END>  mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
    to raze one title of your honour out <SENTENCE-END> 
    to you my lord i comewhat lord you will
    from the most gracious regent of this land
    the duke of york to know what pricks you on
    to take advantage of the absent time

  york <SENTENCE-END>  show me thy humble heart and not thy knee  
    whose duty is deceivable and false <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious uncle
  york <SENTENCE-END>  tut tut
    grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am no traitors uncle and that word grace
    in an ungracious mouth is but profane <SENTENCE-END> 
    why have those banishd and forbidden legs
    dard once to touch a dust of englands ground
    but then more whywhy have they dard to march
    so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
    frighting her palefacd villages with war
    and ostentation of despised arms
    comst thou because the anointed king is hence
    why foolish boy the king is left behind
    and in my loyal bosom lies his power <SENTENCE-END> 
    were i but now lord of such hot youth
    as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
    rescued the black prince that young mars of men
    from forth the ranks of many thousand french
    o then how quickly should this arm of mine  
    now prisoner to the palsy chastise the
    and minister correction to thy fault
  bolingbroke my gracious uncle let me know my fault
    on what condition stands it and wherein
  york <SENTENCE-END>  even in condition of the worst degree
    in gross rebellion and detested treason <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou art a banishd man and here art come
    before the expiration of thy time
    in braving arms against thy sovereign <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  as i was banishd i was banishd hereford
    but as i come i come for lancaster <SENTENCE-END> 
    and noble uncle i beseech your grace
    look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye <SENTENCE-END> 
    you are my father for methinks in you
    i see old gaunt alive <SENTENCE-END>  o then my father
    will you permit that i shall stand condemnd
    a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
    pluckd from my arms perforce and given away
    to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born
    if that my cousin king be king in england  
    it must be granted i am duke of lancaster <SENTENCE-END> 
    you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
    had you first died and he been thus trod down
    he should have found his uncle gaunt a father
    to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am denied to sue my livery here
    and yet my letters patents give me leave <SENTENCE-END> 
    my fathers goods are all distraind and sold
    and these and all are all amiss employd <SENTENCE-END> 
    what would you have me do i am a subject
    and i challenge lawattorneys are denied me
    and therefore personally i lay my claim
    to my inheritance of free descent <SENTENCE-END> 
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  the noble duke hath been too much abused <SENTENCE-END> 
  ross <SENTENCE-END>  it stands your grace upon to do him right <SENTENCE-END> 
  willoughby <SENTENCE-END>  base men by his endowments are made great <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  my lords of england let me tell you this
    i have had feeling of my cousins wrongs
    and labourd all i could to do him right
    but in this kind to come in braving arms  
    be his own carver and cut out his way
    to find out right with wrongit may not be
    and you that do abet him in this kind
    cherish rebellion and are rebels all <SENTENCE-END> 
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
    but for his own and for the right of that
    we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
    and let him never see joy that breaks that oath
  york <SENTENCE-END>  well well i see the issue of these arms <SENTENCE-END> 
    i cannot mend it i must needs confess
    because my power is weak and all ill left
    but if i could by him that gave me life
    i would attach you all and make you stoop
    unto the sovereign mercy of the king
    but since i cannot be it known unto you
    i do remain as neuter <SENTENCE-END>  so fare you well
    unless you please to enter in the castle
    and there repose you for this night <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  an offer uncle that we will accept <SENTENCE-END> 
    but we must win your grace to go with us  
    to bristow castle which they say is held
    by bushy bagot and their complices
    the caterpillars of the commonwealth
    which i have sworn to weed and pluck away <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  it may be i will go with you but yet ill pause
    for i am loath to break our countrys laws <SENTENCE-END> 
    nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are <SENTENCE-END> 
    things past redress are now with me past care <SENTENCE-END>         exeunt

    the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
    the other to enjoy by rage and war <SENTENCE-END> 
    these signs forerun the death or fall of kings <SENTENCE-END>

  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
    i see thy glory like a shooting star
    fall to the base earth from the firmament
    the sun sets weeping in the lowly west
    witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
    thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
    and crossly to thy good all fortune goes <SENTENCE-END>                exit

drums <SENTENCE-END>  flourish and colours <SENTENCE-END>  enter the king the bishop of carlisle
aumerle and soldiers

  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  barkloughly castle can they this at hand
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  yea my lord <SENTENCE-END>  how brooks your grace the air
    after your late tossing on the breaking seas
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  needs must i like it well <SENTENCE-END>  i weep for joy
    to stand upon my kingdom once again <SENTENCE-END> 
    dear earth i do salute thee with my hand
    though rebels wound thee with their horses hoofs <SENTENCE-END> 
    as a longparted mother with her child
    plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
    so weepingsmiling greet i thee my earth
    and do thee favours with my royal hands <SENTENCE-END> 
    feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth
    nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
    but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
    and heavygaited toads lie in their way
    doing annoyance to the treacherous feet  
    which with usurping steps do trample thee
    yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
    and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
    guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
    whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
    throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies <SENTENCE-END> 
    mock not my senseless conjuration lords <SENTENCE-END> 
    this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
    prove armed soldiers ere her native king
    shall falter under foul rebellions arms <SENTENCE-END> 
  carlisle <SENTENCE-END>  fear not my lord that power that made you king
    hath power to keep you king in spite of all <SENTENCE-END> 
    the means that heaven yields must be embracd
    and not neglected else if heaven would
    and we will not heavens offer we refuse
    the proffered means of succour and redress <SENTENCE-END> 
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  he means my lord that we are too remiss
    whilst bolingbroke through our security
    grows strong and great in substance and in power <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  discomfortable cousin knowst thou not  
    that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
    behind the globe that lights the lower world
    then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
    in murders and in outrage boldly here
    but when from under this terrestrial ball
    he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
    and darts his light through every guilty hole
    then murders treasons and detested sins
    the cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs
    stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
    so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
    who all this while hath revelld in the night
    whilst we were wandring with the antipodes
    shall see us rising in our throne the east
    his treasons will sit blushing in his face
    not able to endure the sight of day
    but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin <SENTENCE-END> 
    not all the water in the rough rude sea
    can wash the balm off from an anointed king
    the breath of worldly men cannot depose  
    the deputy elected by the lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    for every man that bolingbroke hath pressd
    to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
    god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
    a glorious angel <SENTENCE-END>  then if angels fight
    weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter salisbury

    welcome my lord <SENTENCE-END>  how far off lies your power
  salisbury <SENTENCE-END>  nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
    than this weak arm <SENTENCE-END>  discomfort guides my tongue
    and bids me speak of nothing but despair <SENTENCE-END> 
    one day too late i fear me noble lord

  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  but now the blood of twenty thousand men
    did triumph in my face and they are fled
    and till so much blood thither come again

    all souls that will be safe fly from my side
    for time hath set a blot upon my pride <SENTENCE-END>

    than can my caretund tongue deliver him <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  mine ear is open and my heart prepard <SENTENCE-END> 
    the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold <SENTENCE-END> 
    say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
    and what loss is it to be rid of care
    strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
    greater he shall not be if he serve god
    well serve him too and be his fellow so <SENTENCE-END> 
    revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
    they break their faith to god as well as us <SENTENCE-END> 
    cry woe destruction ruin and decay
    the worst is death and death will have his day <SENTENCE-END> 
  scroop <SENTENCE-END>  glad am i that your highness is so armd
    to bear the tidings of calamity <SENTENCE-END> 
    like an unseasonable stormy day
    which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
    as if the world were all dissolvd to tears
    so high above his limits swells the rage
    of bolingbroke covering your fearful land  
    with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel <SENTENCE-END> 
    whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps
    against thy majesty boys with womens voices
    strive to speak big and clap their female joints
    in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
    thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
    of doublefatal yew against thy state
    yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
    against thy seat both young and old rebel
    and all goes worse than i have power to tell <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  too well too well thou tellst a tale so in <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot
    what is become of bushy where is green
    that they have let the dangerous enemy
    measure our confines with such peaceful steps
    if we prevail their heads shall pay for it <SENTENCE-END> 
    i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END> 
  scroop <SENTENCE-END>  peace have they made with him indeed my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  o villains vipers damnd without redemption
    dogs easily won to fawn on any man  
    snakes in my heartblood warmd that sting my heart
    three judases each one thrice worse than judas
    would they make peace terrible hell make war
    upon their spotted souls for this offence
  scroop <SENTENCE-END>  sweet love i see changing his property
    turns to the sourest and most deadly hate <SENTENCE-END> 
    again uncurse their souls their peace is made
    with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
    have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound
    and lie full low gravd in the hollow ground <SENTENCE-END> 
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
  scroop <SENTENCE-END>  ay all of them at bristow lost their heads <SENTENCE-END> 
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  where is the duke my father with his power
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  no matter whereof comfort no man speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
    make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
    write sorrow on the bosom of the earth <SENTENCE-END> 
    lets choose executors and talk of wills
    and yet not sofor what can we bequeath
    save our deposed bodies to the ground  
    our lands our lives and an are bolingbrokes <SENTENCE-END> 
    and nothing can we can our own but death
    and that small model of the barren earth
    which serves as paste and cover to our bones <SENTENCE-END> 
    for gods sake let us sit upon the ground
    and tell sad stories of the death of kings
    how some have been deposd some slain in war
    some haunted by the ghosts they have deposd
    some poisond by their wives some sleeping killd
    all murderdfor within the hollow crown
    that rounds the mortal temples of a king
    keeps death his court and there the antic sits
    scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
    allowing him a breath a little scene
    to monarchize be feard and kill with looks
    infusing him with self and vain conceit
    as if this flesh which walls about our life
    were brass impregnable and humourd thus
    comes at the last and with a little pin
    bores through his castle wall and farewell king  
    cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
    with solemn reverence throw away respect
    tradition form and ceremonious duty
    for you have but mistook me all this while <SENTENCE-END> 
    i live with bread like you feel want
    taste grief need friends subjected thus
    how can you say to me i am a king
  carlisle <SENTENCE-END>  my lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes
    but presently prevent the ways to wail <SENTENCE-END> 
    to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
    gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
    and so your follies fight against yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
    fear and be slainno worse can come to fight
    and fight and die is death destroying death
    where fearing dying pays death servile breath <SENTENCE-END> 
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  my father hath a power inquire of him
    and learn to make a body of a limb <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  thou chidst me well <SENTENCE-END>  proud bolingbroke i come
    to change blows with thee for our day of doom <SENTENCE-END> 
    this ague fit of fear is overblown  
    an easy task it is to win our own <SENTENCE-END> 
    say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
    speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour <SENTENCE-END> 
  scroop <SENTENCE-END>  men judge by the complexion of the sky
    the state in inclination of the day
    so may you by my dull and heavy eye
    my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say <SENTENCE-END> 
    i play the torturer by small and small
    to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
    your uncle york is joind with bolingbroke
    and all your northern castles yielded up
    and all your southern gentlemen in arms
    upon his party <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  thou hast said enough <SENTENCE-END> 
      to aumerle beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
    of that sweet way i was in to despair
    what say you now what comfort have we now
    by heaven ill hate him everlastingly
    that bids me be of comfort any more <SENTENCE-END> 
    go to flint castle there ill pine away  
    a king woes slave shall kingly woe obey <SENTENCE-END> 
    that power i have discharge and let them go
    to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
    for i have none <SENTENCE-END>  let no man speak again
    to alter this for counsel is but vain <SENTENCE-END> 
  aumerle <SENTENCE-END>  my liege one word <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  he does me double wrong
    that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
    discharge my followers let them hence away
    from richards night to bolingbrokes fair day <SENTENCE-END>        exeunt

  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  the news is very fair and good my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    richard not far from hence hath hid his head <SENTENCE-END>

    when such a sacred king should hide his head
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  your grace mistakes only to be brief
    left i his title out <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  the time hath been
    would you have been so brief with him he would

    through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
    into his ruind ears and thus deliver

    and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
    to his most royal person hither come
    even at his feet to lay my arms and power
    provided that my banishment repeald
    and lands restord again be freely granted
    if not ill use the advantage of my power
    and lay the summers dust with showers of blood
    raind from the wounds of slaughtered englishmen
    the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
    it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
    the fresh green lap of fair king richards land
    my stooping duty tenderly shall show <SENTENCE-END> 
    go signify as much while here we march
    upon the grassy carpet of this plain <SENTENCE-END>

    lets march without the noise of threatning drum
    that from this castles tottered battlements
    our fair appointments may be well perusd <SENTENCE-END> 
    methinks king richard and myself should meet
    with no less terror than the elements
    of fire and water when their thundring shock
    at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven <SENTENCE-END> 
    be he the fire ill be the yielding water
    the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain

      enter on the walls the king the bishop of carlisle
      aumerle scroop and salisbury

    see see king richard doth himself appear
    as doth the blushing discontented sun
    from out the fiery portal of the east
    when he perceives the envious clouds are bent  
    to dim his glory and to stain the track
    of his bright passage to the occident <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  yet he looks like a king <SENTENCE-END>  behold his eye
    as bright as is the eagles lightens forth
    controlling majesty <SENTENCE-END>  alack alack for woe
    that any harm should stain so fair a show
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  to northumberland we are amazd and thus long
      have we stood
    to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
    because we thought ourself thy lawful king
    and if we be how dare thy joints forget
    to pay their awful duty to our presence
    if we be not show us the hand of god
    that hath dismissd us from our stewardship
    for well we know no hand of blood and bone
    can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
    unless he do profane steal or usurp <SENTENCE-END> 
    and though you think that all as you have done
    have torn their souls by turning them from us
    and we are barren and bereft of friends  
    yet knowmy master god omnipotent
    is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
    armies of pestilence and they shall strike
    your children yet unborn and unbegot
    that lift your vassal hands against my head
    and threat the glory of my precious crown <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands
    that every stride he makes upon my land
    is dangerous treason he is come to open
    the purple testament of bleeding war
    but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
    ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
    shall ill become the flower of englands face

    her pastures grass with faithful english blood <SENTENCE-END>

    that stands upon your royal grandsires bones
    and by the royalties of both your bloods
    currents that spring from one most gracious head
    and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt
    and by the worth and honour of himself
    comprising all that may be sworn or said
    his coming hither hath no further scope
    than for his lineal royalties and to beg
    enfranchisement immediate on his knees
    which on thy royal party granted once
    his glittering arms he will commend to rust
    his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
    to faithful service of your majesty <SENTENCE-END>

    my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
    my gay apparel for an almsmans gown
    my figurd goblets for a dish of wood
    my sceptre for a palmers walking staff

    and my large kingdom for a little grave

enter the queen and two ladies

  queen <SENTENCE-END>  what sport shall we devise here in this garden
    to drive away the heavy thought of care
  lady <SENTENCE-END>  madam well play at bowls <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  twill make me think the world is full of rubs
    and that my fortune runs against the bias <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady <SENTENCE-END>  madam well dance <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  my legs can keep no measure in delight
    when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
    therefore no dancing girl some other sport <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady <SENTENCE-END>  madam well tell tales <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  of sorrow or of joy
  lady <SENTENCE-END>  of either madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  of neither girl
    for if of joy being altogether wanting
    it doth remember me the more of sorrow
    or if of grief being altogether had
    it adds more sorrow to my want of joy  
    for what i have i need not to repeat
    and what i want it boots not to complain <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady <SENTENCE-END>  madam ill sing <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  tis well that thou hast cause
    but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep <SENTENCE-END> 
  lady <SENTENCE-END>  i could weep madam would it do you good <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  and i could sing would weeping do me good
    and never borrow any tear of thee <SENTENCE-END> 

           enter a gardener and two servants

    but stay here come the gardeners <SENTENCE-END> 
    lets step into the shadow of these trees <SENTENCE-END> 
    my wretchedness unto a row of pins
    they will talk of state for every one doth so
    against a change woe is forerun with woe <SENTENCE-END> 
                                       queen and ladies retire
  gardener <SENTENCE-END>  go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
    which like unruly children make their sire
    stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight  
    give some supportance to the bending twigs <SENTENCE-END> 
    go thou and eke an executioner
    cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
    that look too lofty in our commonwealth
    all must be even in our government <SENTENCE-END> 
    you thus employd i will go root away
    the noisome weeds which without profit suck
    the soils fertility from wholesome flowers <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  why should we in the compass of a pale
    keep law and form and due proportion
    showing as in a model our firm estate
    when our seawalled garden the whole land
    is full of weeds her fairest flowers chokd up
    her fruit trees all unprund her hedges ruind
    her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs
    swarming with caterpillars
  gardener <SENTENCE-END>  hold thy peace <SENTENCE-END> 
    he that hath sufferd this disorderd spring
    hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
    the weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter  
    that seemd in eating him to hold him up
    are pluckd up root and all by bolingbroke
    i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  what are they dead
  gardener <SENTENCE-END>  they are and bolingbroke
    hath seizd the wasteful king <SENTENCE-END>  o what pity is it
    that he had not so trimmd and dressd his land
    as we this garden we at time of year
    do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees
    lest being overproud in sap and blood
    with too much riches it confound itself
    had he done so to great and growing men
    they might have evd to bear and he to taste
    their fruits of duty <SENTENCE-END>  superfluous branches
    we lop away that bearing boughs may live
    had he done so himself had home the crown
    which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  what think you the king shall be deposed
  gardener <SENTENCE-END>  depressd he is already and deposd
    tis doubt he will be <SENTENCE-END>  letters came last night  
    to a dear friend of the good duke of yorks
    that tell black tidings <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  o i am pressd to death through want of speaking
                                                coming forward
    thou old adams likeness set to dress this garden
    how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
    what eve what serpent hath suggested the
    to make a second fall of cursed man
    why dost thou say king richard is deposd
    darst thou thou little better thing than earth
    divine his downfall say where when and how
    camst thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch <SENTENCE-END> 
  gardener <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me madam little joy have
    to breathe this news yet what i say is true <SENTENCE-END> 
    king richard he is in the mighty hold
    of bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  their fortunes both are weighd <SENTENCE-END> 
    in your lords scale is nothing but himself
    and some few vanities that make him light
    but in the balance of great bolingbroke
    besides himself are all the english peers  
    and with that odds he weighs king richard down <SENTENCE-END> 
    post you to london and you will find it so
    i speak no more than every one doth know <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen <SENTENCE-END>  nimble mischance that art so light of foot
    doth not thy embassage belong to me
    and am i last that knows it o thou thinkest
    to serve me last that i may longest keep
    thy sorrow in my breast <SENTENCE-END>  come ladies go
    to meet at london londons king in woe <SENTENCE-END> 
    what was i born to this that my sad look
    should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
    gardner for telling me these news of woe
    pray god the plants thou graftst may never grow
                                         exeunt queen and ladies
  gardener <SENTENCE-END>  poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
    i would my skill were subject to thy curse <SENTENCE-END> 
    here did she fall a tear here in this place
    ill set a bank of rue sour herb of grace <SENTENCE-END> 
    rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
    in the remembrance of a weeping queen <SENTENCE-END>                 exeunt

    disorder horror fear and mutiny
    shall here inhabit and this land be calld
    the field of golgotha and dead mens skulls <SENTENCE-END>

    before i have shook off the regal thoughts
    wherewith i reignd i hardly yet have learnd  
    to insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee <SENTENCE-END> 
    give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
    to this submission <SENTENCE-END>  yet i well remember
    the favours of these men <SENTENCE-END>  were they not mine
    did they not sometime cry all hail to me
    so judas did to christ but he in twelve
    found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none <SENTENCE-END> 
    god save the king will no man say amen
    am i both priest and clerk well then amen <SENTENCE-END> 
    god save the king although i be not he
    and yet amen if heaven do think him me <SENTENCE-END> 
    to do what service am i sent for hither
  york <SENTENCE-END>  to do that office of thine own good will
    which tired majesty did make thee offer
    the resignation of thy state and crown
    to henry bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  give me the crown <SENTENCE-END>  here cousin seize the crown <SENTENCE-END> 
    here cousin
    on this side my hand and on that side thine <SENTENCE-END> 
    now is this golden crown like a deep well  
    that owes two buckets filling one another
    the emptier ever dancing in the air
    the other down unseen and full of water <SENTENCE-END> 
    that bucket down and fun of tears am i
    drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  i thought you had been willing to resign <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  my crown i am but still my griefs are mine <SENTENCE-END> 
    you may my glories and my state depose
    but not my griefs still am i king of those <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  part of your cares you give me with your crown <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  your cares set up do not pluck my cares down <SENTENCE-END> 
    my care is loss of care by old care done
    your care is gain of care by new care won <SENTENCE-END> 
    the cares i give i have though given away
    they tend the crown yet still with me they stay <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  are you contented to resign the crown
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  ay no no ay for i must nothing be
    therefore no no for i resign to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    now mark me how i will undo myself
    i give this heavy weight from off my head  
    and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
    the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
    with mine own tears i wash away my balm
    with mine own hands i give away my crown
    with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
    with mine own breath release all duteous oaths
    all pomp and majesty i do forswear
    my manors rents revenues i forgo
    my acts decrees and statutes i deny <SENTENCE-END> 
    god pardon all oaths that are broke to me
    god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee
    make me that nothing have with nothing grievd
    and thou with all pleasd that hast an achievd <SENTENCE-END>

    and soon lie richard in an earthly pit <SENTENCE-END> 
    god save king henry unkingd richard says
    and send him many years of sunshine days
    what more remains
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  no more but that you read
    these accusations and these grievous crimes  
    committed by your person and your followers
    against the state and profit of this land
    that by confessing them the souls of men
    may deem that you are worthily deposd <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  must i do so and must i ravel out
    my weavdup follies gentle northumberland
    if thy offences were upon record
    would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
    to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst
    there shouldst thou find one heinous article
    containing the deposing of a king
    and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
    markd with a blot damnd in the book of heaven <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay all of you that stand and look upon me
    whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
    though some of you with pilate wash your hands
    showing an outward pityyet you pilates
    have here deliverd me to my sour cross
    and water cannot wash away your sin <SENTENCE-END> 
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  my lord dispatch read oer these  
    articles <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see <SENTENCE-END> 
    and yet salt water blinds them not so much
    but they can see a sort of traitors here <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself
    i find myself a traitor with the rest
    for i have given here my souls consent
    tundeck the pompous body of a king
    made glory base and sovereignty a slave
    proud majesty a subject state a peasant <SENTENCE-END> 
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
    nor no mans lord i have no name no tide
    no not that name was given me at the font
    but tis usurpd <SENTENCE-END>  alack the heavy day
    that i have worn so many winters out
    and know not now what name to call myself
    o that i were a mockery king of snow
    standing before the sun of bolingbroke
    to melt myself away in water drops  
    good king great king and yet not greatly good
    an if my word be sterling yet in england
    let it command a mirror hither straight
    that it may show me what a face i have
    since it is bankrupt of his majesty <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  go some of you and fetch a lookingglass <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               exit an attendant
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  read oer this paper while the glass doth come <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  urge it no more my lord northumberland <SENTENCE-END> 
  northumberland <SENTENCE-END>  the commons will not then be satisfied <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  they shall be satisfied <SENTENCE-END>  ill read enough
    when i do see the very book indeed
    where all my sins are writ and thats myself <SENTENCE-END> 

                reenter attendant with glass

    give me that glass and therein will i read <SENTENCE-END> 
    no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
    so many blows upon this face of mine  
    and made no deeper wounds o flattring glass
    like to my followers in prosperity
    thou dost beguile me was this face the face
    that every day under his household roof
    did keep ten thousand men was this the face
    that like the sun did make beholders wink
    is this the face which facd so many follies
    that was at last outfacd by bolingbroke
    a brittle glory shineth in this face
    as brittle as the glory is the face
                        dashes the glass against the ground
    for there it is crackd in a hundred shivers <SENTENCE-END> 
    mark silent king the moral of this sport
    how soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  the shadow of your sorrow hath destroyd
    the shadow of your face <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  say that again <SENTENCE-END> 
    the shadow of my sorrow ha lets see <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis very true my grief lies all within
    and these external manner of laments  
    are merely shadows to the unseen grief
    that swells with silence in the torturd soul <SENTENCE-END> 
    there lies the substance and i thank thee king
    for thy great bounty that not only givst
    me cause to wail but teachest me the way
    how to lament the cause <SENTENCE-END>  ill beg one boon
    and then be gone and trouble you no more <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall i obtain it
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  name it fair cousin <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  fair cousin i am greater than a king
    for when i was a king my flatterers
    were then but subjects being now a subject
    i have a king here to my flatterer <SENTENCE-END> 
    being so great i have no need to beg <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  yet ask <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  and shall i have

    of woeful ages long ago betid
    and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
    tell thou the lamentable tale of me
    and send the hearers weeping to their beds
    for why the senseless brands will sympathize
    the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
    and in compassion weep the fire out

    for the deposing of a rightful king <SENTENCE-END>

scene 2 <SENTENCE-END> 
the duke of yorks palace

enter the duke of york and the duchess

  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  my lord you told me you would tell the rest
    when weeping made you break the story off
    of our two cousins coming into london <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  where did i leave
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  at that sad stop my lord
    where rude misgoverned hands from windows tops
    threw dust and rubbish on king richards head <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  then as i said the duke great bolingbroke
    mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
    which his aspiring rider seemd to know
    with slow but stately pace kept on his course
    whilst all tongues cried god save thee bolingbroke
    you would have thought the very windows spake
    so many greedy looks of young and old
    through casements darted their desiring eyes
    upon his visage and that all the walls
    with painted imagery had said at once  
    jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke
    whilst he from the one side to the other turning
    bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck
    bespake them thus i thank you countrymen <SENTENCE-END> 
    and thus still doing thus he passd along <SENTENCE-END> 
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  alack poor richard where rode he the whilst
  york <SENTENCE-END>  as in a theatre the eyes of men
    after a wellgracd actor leaves the stage
    are idly bent on him that enters next
    thinking his prattle to be tedious
    even so or with much more contempt mens eyes
    did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him
    no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
    but dust was thrown upon his sacred head
    which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
    his face still combating with tears and smiles
    the badges of his grief and patience
    that had not god for some strong purpose steeld
    the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
    and barbarism itself have pitied him <SENTENCE-END>   
    but heaven hath a hand in these events
    to whose high will we bound our calm contents <SENTENCE-END> 
    to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
    whose state and honour i for aye allow <SENTENCE-END> 
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  here comes my son aumerle <SENTENCE-END>

    if any plague hang over us tis he <SENTENCE-END> 
    i would to god my lords he might be found <SENTENCE-END> 
    inquire at london mongst the taverns there
    for there they say he daily doth frequent
    with unrestrained loose companions
    even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
    and beat our watch and rob our passengers

    takes on the point of honour to support
    so dissolute a crew <SENTENCE-END> 
  percy <SENTENCE-END>  my lord some two days since i saw the prince
    and told him of those triumphs held at oxford <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  and what said the gallant
  percy <SENTENCE-END>  his answer was he would unto the stews
    and from the commonst creature pluck a glove  
    and wear it as a favour and with that
    he would unhorse the lustiest challenger <SENTENCE-END> 
  bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END>  as dissolute as desperate yet through both
    i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
    may happily bring forth <SENTENCE-END>  but who comes here

    we pray with heart and soul and all beside <SENTENCE-END> 
    his weary joints would gladly rise i know

    thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
    or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
    that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
    pity may move thee pardon to rehearse <SENTENCE-END>

  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
    yet am i sick for fear <SENTENCE-END>  speak it again <SENTENCE-END>

scene 5 <SENTENCE-END> 
pomfret castle <SENTENCE-END>  the dungeon of the castle

enter king richard

  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  i have been studying how i may compare
    this prison where i live unto the world
    and for because the world is populous
    and here is not a creature but myself
    i cannot do it <SENTENCE-END>  yet ill hammer it out <SENTENCE-END> 
    my brain ill prove the female to my soul
    my soul the father and these two beget
    a generation of stillbreeding thoughts
    and these same thoughts people this little world
    in humours like the people of this world
    for no thought is contented <SENTENCE-END>  the better sort
    as thoughts of things divine are intermixd
    with scruples and do set the word itself
    against the word
    as thus come little ones and then again
    it is as hard to come as for a camel
    to thread the postern of a small needles eye <SENTENCE-END>   
    thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
    unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
    may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
    of this hard world my ragged prison walls
    and for they cannot die in their own pride <SENTENCE-END> 
    thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
    that they are not the first of fortunes slaves
    nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
    who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
    that many have and others must sit there
    and in this thought they find a kind of ease
    bearing their own misfortunes on the back
    of such as have before endurd the like <SENTENCE-END> 
    thus play i in one person many people
    and none contented <SENTENCE-END>  sometimes am i king
    then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
    and so i am <SENTENCE-END>  then crushing penury
    persuades me i was better when a king
    then am i kingd again and by and by
    think that i am unkingd by bolingbroke  
    and straight am nothing <SENTENCE-END>  but whateer i be
    nor i nor any man that but man is
    with nothing shall be pleasd till he be easd
    with being nothing <SENTENCE-END>                     the music plays
    music do i hear
    ha ha keep time <SENTENCE-END>  how sour sweet music is
    when time is broke and no proportion kept
    so is it in the music of mens lives <SENTENCE-END> 
    and here have i the daintiness of ear
    to check time broke in a disorderd string
    but for the concord of my state and time
    had not an ear to hear my true time broke <SENTENCE-END> 
    i wasted time and now doth time waste me
    for now hath time made me his numbring clock
    my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
    their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
    whereto my finger like a dials point
    is pointing still in cleansing them from tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
    are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart  
    which is the bell <SENTENCE-END>  so sighs and tears and groans
    show minutes times and hours but my time
    runs posting on in bolingbrokes proud joy
    while i stand fooling here his jack of the clock <SENTENCE-END> 
    this music mads me <SENTENCE-END>  let it sound no more
    for though it have holp madmen to their wits
    in me it seems it will make wise men mad <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
    for tis a sign of love and love to richard
    is a strange brooch in this allhating world <SENTENCE-END> 

              enter a groom of the stable

  groom <SENTENCE-END>  hail royal prince
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  thanks noble peer
    the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear <SENTENCE-END> 
    what art thou and how comest thou hither
    where no man never comes but that sad dog
    that brings me food to make misfortune live
  groom <SENTENCE-END>  i was a poor groom of thy stable king  
    when thou wert king who travelling towards york
    with much ado at length have gotten leave
    to look upon my sometimes royal masters face <SENTENCE-END> 
    o how it ernd my heart when i beheld
    in london streets that coronationday
    when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary
    that horse that thou so often hast bestrid
    that horse that i so carefully have dressd
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend
    how went he under him
  groom <SENTENCE-END>  so proudly as if he disdaind the ground <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
    that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
    this hand hath made him proud with clapping him <SENTENCE-END> 
    would he not stumble would he not fall down
    since pride must have a fall and break the neck
    of that proud man that did usurp his back
    forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee
    since thou created to be awd by man
    wast born to bear i was not made a horse  
    and yet i bear a burden like an ass
    spurrd galld and tird by jauncing bolingbroke <SENTENCE-END> 

              enter keeper with meat

  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  fellow give place here is no longer stay <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  if thou love me tis time thou wert away <SENTENCE-END> 
  groom <SENTENCE-END>  my tongue dares not that my heart shall say <SENTENCE-END> 
 exit
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  my lord willt please you to fall to
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  taste of it first as thou art wont to do <SENTENCE-END> 
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i dare not <SENTENCE-END>  sir pierce of exton
    who lately came from the king commands the contrary <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  the devil take henry of lancaster and thee
    patience is stale and i am weary of it <SENTENCE-END> 
                                           beats the keeper
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  help help help
    the murderers exton and servants rush in armed
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  how now what means death in this rude assault
    villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument <SENTENCE-END>   
                         snatching a weapon and killing one
    go thou and fill another room in hell <SENTENCE-END> 
              he kills another then exton strikes him down
    that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
    that staggers thus my person <SENTENCE-END>  exton thy fierce hand
    hath with the kings blood staind the kings own land <SENTENCE-END> 
    mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
    whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                       dies
  exton <SENTENCE-END>  as full of valour as of royal blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    both have i spilld <SENTENCE-END>  o would the deed were good
    for now the devil that told me i did well
    says that this deed is chronicled in hell <SENTENCE-END> 
    this dead king to the living king ill bear <SENTENCE-END>

king richard the third



act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene 1 <SENTENCE-END> 

london <SENTENCE-END>  a street

enter richard duke of gloucester solus

  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  now is the winter of our discontent
    made glorious summer by this sun of york
    and all the clouds that lourd upon our house
    in the deep bosom of the ocean buried <SENTENCE-END> 
    now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
    our bruised arms hung up for monuments
    our stern alarums changd to merry meetings
    our dreadful marches to delightful measures <SENTENCE-END> 
    grimvisagd war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
    and now instead of mounting barbed steeds
    to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
    he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
    to the lascivious pleasing of a lute <SENTENCE-END> 
    but ithat am not shapd for sportive tricks
    nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
    ithat am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
    to strut before a wanton ambling nymph  
    ithat am curtaild of this fair proportion
    cheated of feature by dissembling nature
    deformd unfinishd sent before my time
    into this breathing world scarce half made up
    and that so lamely and unfashionable
    that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
    why i in this weak piping time of peace
    have no delight to pass away the time
    unless to spy my shadow in the sun
    and descant on mine own deformity <SENTENCE-END> 
    and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
    to entertain these fair wellspoken days
    i am determined to prove a villain
    and hate the idle pleasures of these days <SENTENCE-END> 
    plots have i laid inductions dangerous
    by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
    to set my brother clarence and the king
    in deadly hate the one against the other
    and if king edward be as true and just
    as i am subtle false and treacherous  
    this day should clarence closely be mewd up
    about a prophecy which says that g
    of edwards heirs the murderer shall be <SENTENCE-END> 
    dive thoughts down to my soul <SENTENCE-END>  here clarence comes <SENTENCE-END> 

             enter clarence guarded and brakenbury

    brother good day <SENTENCE-END>  what means this armed guard
    that waits upon your grace
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  his majesty
    tendring my persons safety hath appointed
    this conduct to convey me to th tower <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  upon what cause
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  because my name is george <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  alack my lord that fault is none of yours
    he should for that commit your godfathers <SENTENCE-END> 
    o belike his majesty hath some intent
    that you should be newchristned in the tower <SENTENCE-END> 
    but whats the matter clarence may i know
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  yea richard when i know for i protest  
    as yet i do not but as i can learn
    he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
    and from the crossrow plucks the letter g
    and says a wizard told him that by g
    his issue disinherited should be
    and for my name of george begins with g
    it follows in his thought that i am he <SENTENCE-END> 
    these as i learn and such like toys as these
    hath movd his highness to commit me now <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  why this it is when men are ruld by women
    tis not the king that sends you to the tower
    my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
    that tempers him to this extremity <SENTENCE-END> 
    was it not she and that good man of worship
    antony woodville her brother there
    that made him send lord hastings to the tower
    from whence this present day he is delivered
    we are not safe clarence we are not safe <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  by heaven i think there is no man is secure
    but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds  
    that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore <SENTENCE-END> 
    heard you not what an humble suppliant
    lord hastings was for her delivery
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  humbly complaining to her deity
    got my lord chamberlain his liberty <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill tell you whati think it is our way
    if we will keep in favour with the king
    to be her men and wear her livery
    the jealous oerworn widow and herself
    since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
    are mighty gossips in our monarchy <SENTENCE-END> 
  brakenbury <SENTENCE-END>  i beseech your graces both to pardon me
    his majesty hath straitly given in charge
    that no man shall have private conference
    of what degree soever with your brother <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  even so ant please your worship brakenbury
    you may partake of any thing we say
    we speak no treason man we say the king
    is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
    well struck in years fair and not jealous  
    we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot
    a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
    and that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks <SENTENCE-END> 
    how say you sir can you deny all this
  brakenbury <SENTENCE-END>  with this my lord myself have naught to do <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee
    fellow
    he that doth naught with her excepting one
    were best to do it secretly alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  brakenbury <SENTENCE-END>  what one my lord
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
  brakenbury <SENTENCE-END>  i do beseech your grace to pardon me and
    withal
    forbear your conference with the noble duke <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  we know thy charge brakenbury and will
    obey <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  we are the queens abjects and must obey <SENTENCE-END> 
    brother farewell i will unto the king
    and whatsoeer you will employ me in
    were it to call king edwards widow sister  
    i will perform it to enfranchise you <SENTENCE-END> 
    meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
    touches me deeper than you can imagine <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  i know it pleaseth neither of us well <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  well your imprisonment shall not be long
    i will deliver or else lie for you <SENTENCE-END> 
    meantime have patience <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  i must perforce <SENTENCE-END>  farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
                          exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  go tread the path that thou shalt neer return <SENTENCE-END> 
    simple plain clarence i do love thee so
    that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
    if heaven will take the present at our hands <SENTENCE-END> 
    but who comes here the newdelivered hastings

    how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  with patience noble lord as prisoners must
    but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
    that were the cause of my imprisonment <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
    for they that were your enemies are his
    and have prevaild as much on him as you <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  more pity that the eagles should be mewd
    whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  what news abroad
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  no news so bad abroad as this at home
    the king is sickly weak and melancholy
    and his physicians fear him mightily <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  now by saint john that news is bad indeed <SENTENCE-END> 
    o he hath kept an evil diet long
    and overmuch consumd his royal person
    tis very grievous to be thought upon <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is he in his bed
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  he is <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  go you before and i will follow you <SENTENCE-END>   
                                                   exit hastings

    till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence
    with lies well steeld with weighty arguments
    and if i fail not in my deep intent
    clarence hath not another day to live
    which done god take king edward to his mercy
    and leave the world for me to bustle in
    for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
    what though i killd her husband and her father
    the readiest way to make the wench amends
    is to become her husband and her father
    the which will inot all so much for love
    as for another secret close intent
    by marrying her which i must reach unto <SENTENCE-END> 
    but yet i run before my horse to market <SENTENCE-END> 
    clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns
    when they are gone then must i count my gains <SENTENCE-END>          exit

    to leave this keen encounter of our wits
    and fall something into a slower method
    is not the causer of the timeless deaths
    of these plantagenets henry and edward
    as blameful as the executioner
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  thou wast the cause and most accursd effect <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  your beauty was the cause of that effect
    your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep  
    to undertake the death of all the world
    so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  if i thought that i tell thee homicide
    these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  these eyes could not endure that beautys
    wreck
    you should not blemish it if i stood by <SENTENCE-END> 
    as all the world is cheered by the sun
    so i by that it is my day my life <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  black night oershade thy day and death thy life
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  curse not thyself fair creature thou art both <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  i would i were to be revengd on thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  it is a quarrel most unnatural
    to be revengd on him that loveth thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  it is a quarrel just and reasonable
    to be revengd on him that killd my husband <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
    did it to help thee to a better husband <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  his better doth not breathe upon the earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  he lives that loves thee better than he could <SENTENCE-END>   
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  name him <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  plantagenet <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  why that was he <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  the selfsame name but one of better nature <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  where is he
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  here <SENTENCE-END>   she spits at him  why dost thou spit
    at me
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  would it were mortal poison for thy sake
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  never came poison from so sweet a place <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  never hung poison on a fouler toad <SENTENCE-END> 
    out of my sight thou dost infect mine eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  i would they were that i might die at once
    for now they kill me with a living death <SENTENCE-END> 
    those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
    shamd their aspects with store of childish drops
    these eyes which never shed remorseful tear
    no when my father york and edward wept
    to hear the piteous moan that rutland made  
    when blackfacd clifford shook his sword at him
    nor when thy warlike father like a child
    told the sad story of my fathers death
    and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
    that all the standersby had wet their cheeks
    like trees bedashd with rainin that sad time
    my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
    and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
    thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping <SENTENCE-END> 
    i never sued to friend nor enemy
    my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
    but now thy beauty is proposd my fee
    my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
                                   she looks scornfully at him
    teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made
    for kissing lady not for such contempt <SENTENCE-END> 
    if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
    lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword
    which if thou please to hide in this true breast
    and let the soul forth that adoreth thee  
    i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
    and humbly beg the death upon my knee <SENTENCE-END> 
      he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword
    nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
    but twas thy beauty that provoked me <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward
    but twas thy heavenly face that set me on <SENTENCE-END> 
                                           she falls the sword
    take up the sword again or take up me <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  arise dissembler though i wish thy death
    i will not be thy executioner <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  then bid me kill myself and i will do it
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  i have already <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  that was in thy rage <SENTENCE-END> 
    speak it again and even with the word
    this hand which for thy love did kill thy love
    shall for thy love kill a far truer love
    to both their deaths shalt thou be accessary <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  i would i knew thy heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  tis figurd in my tongue <SENTENCE-END>   
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  i fear me both are false <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  then never was man true <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  well put up your sword <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  say then my peace is made <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  that shalt thou know hereafter <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  but shall i live in hope
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  all men i hope live so <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  vouchsafe to wear this ring <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  to take is not to give <SENTENCE-END>                puts on the ring
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  look how my ring encompasseth thy finger
    even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
    wear both of them for both of them are thine <SENTENCE-END> 
    and if thy poor devoted servant may
    but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
    thou dost confirm his happiness for ever <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  what is it
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  that it may please you leave these sad designs
    to him that hath most cause to be a mourner
    and presently repair to crosby house
    whereafter i have solemnly interrd  
    at chertsey monastry this noble king
    and wet his grave with my repentant tears
    i will with all expedient duty see you <SENTENCE-END> 
    for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
    grant me this boon <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  with all my heart and much it joys me too
    to see you are become so penitent <SENTENCE-END> 
    tressel and berkeley go along with me <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  bid me farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
  anne <SENTENCE-END>  tis more than you deserve
    but since you teach me how to flatter you
    imagine i have said farewell already <SENTENCE-END> 
                             exeunt two gentlemen with lady anne
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  sirs take up the corse <SENTENCE-END> 
  gentlemen <SENTENCE-END>  towards chertsey noble lord
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  no to white friars there attend my coming <SENTENCE-END> 
                                       exeunt all but gloucester
    was ever woman in this humour wood
    was ever woman in this humour won
    ill have her but i will not keep her long <SENTENCE-END>   
    what i that killd her husband and his father
    to take her in her hearts extremest hate
    with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
    the bleeding witness of my hatred by
    having god her conscience and these bars against me
    and i no friends to back my suit at all
    but the plain devil and dissembling looks
    and yet to win her all the world to nothing
    ha
    hath she forgot already that brave prince
    edward her lord whom i some three months since
    stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury
    a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
    framd in the prodigality of nature
    young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
    the spacious world cannot again afford
    and will she yet abase her eyes on me
    that croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince
    and made her widow to a woeful bed
    on me whose all not equals edwards moiety  
    on me that halts and am misshapen thus
    my dukedom to a beggarly denier
    i do mistake my person all this while <SENTENCE-END> 
    upon my life she finds although i cannot
    myself to be a marvllous proper man <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill be at charges for a lookingglass
    and entertain a score or two of tailors
    to study fashions to adorn my body <SENTENCE-END> 
    since i am crept in favour with myself
    i will maintain it with some little cost <SENTENCE-END> 
    but first ill turn yon fellow in his grave
    and then return lamenting to my love <SENTENCE-END> 
    shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
    that i may see my shadow as i pass <SENTENCE-END>                      exit

    because i cannot flatter and look fair

    with silken sly insinuating jacks
  grey <SENTENCE-END>  to who in all this presence speaks your grace

    height

    to be revengd on rivers dorset grey
    but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
    tell them that god bids us do good for evil <SENTENCE-END> 
    and thus i clothe my naked villainy

scene 4 <SENTENCE-END> 

london <SENTENCE-END>  the tower

enter clarence and keeper

  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  why looks your grace so heavily today
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  o i have passd a miserable night
    so full of fearful dreams of ugly sights
    that as i am a christian faithful man
    i would not spend another such a night
    though twere to buy a world of happy days
    so full of dismal terror was the time
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  what was your dream my lord i pray you
    tell me <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  methoughts that i had broken from the tower
    and was embarkd to cross to burgundy
    and in my company my brother gloucester
    who from my cabin tempted me to walk
    upon the hatches <SENTENCE-END>  thence we lookd toward england
    and cited up a thousand heavy times
    during the wars of york and lancaster
    that had befalln us <SENTENCE-END>  as we pacd along  
    upon the giddy footing of the hatches
    methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
    struck me that thought to stay him overboard
    into the tumbling billows of the main <SENTENCE-END> 
    o lord methought what pain it was to drown
    what dreadful noise of waters in my ears
    what sights of ugly death within my eyes
    methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
    a thousand men that fishes gnawd upon
    wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
    inestimable stones unvalued jewels
    all scattred in the bottom of the sea
    some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes
    where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
    as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
    that wood the slimy bottom of the deep
    and mockd the dead bones that lay scattred by <SENTENCE-END> 
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  had you such leisure in the time of death
    to gaze upon these secrets of the deep
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  methought i had and often did i strive  
    to yield the ghost but still the envious flood
    stoppd in my soul and would not let it forth
    to find the empty vast and wandring air
    but smotherd it within my panting bulk
    who almost burst to belch it in the sea <SENTENCE-END> 
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  awakd you not in this sore agony
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  no no my dream was lengthend after life <SENTENCE-END> 
    o then began the tempest to my soul
    i passd methought the melancholy flood
    with that sour ferryman which poets write of
    unto the kingdom of perpetual night <SENTENCE-END> 
    the first that there did greet my stranger soul
    was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick
    who spake aloud what scourge for perjury
    can this dark monarchy afford false clarence
    and so he vanishd <SENTENCE-END>  then came wandring by
    a shadow like an angel with bright hair
    dabbled in blood and he shriekd out aloud
    clarence is comefalse fleeting perjurd clarence
    that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury <SENTENCE-END>   
    seize on him furies take him unto torment
    with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
    environd me and howled in mine ears
    such hideous cries that with the very noise
    i trembling wakd and for a season after
    could not believe but that i was in hell
    such terrible impression made my dream <SENTENCE-END> 
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  no marvel lord though it affrighted you
    i am afraid methinks to hear you tell it <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  ah keeper keeper i have done these things
    that now give evidence against my soul
    for edwards sake and see how he requites me
    o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
    but thou wilt be avengd on my misdeeds
    yet execute thy wrath in me alone
    o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
  keeper i prithee sit by me awhile
    my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  keeper <SENTENCE-END>  i will my lord <SENTENCE-END>  god give your grace good rest <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               clarence sleeps  

                  enter brakenbury the lieutenant

  brakenbury <SENTENCE-END>  sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
    makes the night morning and the noontide night <SENTENCE-END> 
    princes have but their titles for their glories
    an outward honour for an inward toil
    and for unfelt imaginations
    they often feel a world of restless cares
    so that between their tides and low name
    theres nothing differs but the outward fame <SENTENCE-END> 

                      enter the two murderers

  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  ho whos here

                                           brakenbury reads it
  brakenbury <SENTENCE-END>  i am in this commanded to deliver
    the noble duke of clarence to your hands <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will not reason what is meant hereby
    because i will be guiltless from the meaning <SENTENCE-END> 
    there lies the duke asleep and there the keys <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill to the king and signify to him
    that thus i have resignd to you my charge <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  you may sir tis a point of wisdom <SENTENCE-END>  fare
    you well <SENTENCE-END>                        exeunt brakenbury and keeper

    he wakes <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  why he shall never wake until the great
    judgmentday <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  why then hell say we stabbd him
    sleeping <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  the urging of that word judgment hath  
    bred a kind of remorse in me <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  what art thou afraid
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  not to kill him having a warrant but to
    be damnd for killing him from the which no warrant can
    defend me <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  i thought thou hadst been resolute <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  so i am to let him live <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  ill back to the duke of gloucester and
    tell him so <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  nay i prithee stay a little <SENTENCE-END>  i hope this
    passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to
    hold me but while one tells twenty <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  how dost thou feel thyself now
    second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  faith some certain dregs of conscience
    are yet within me <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  remember our reward when the deeds
    done <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  zounds he dies i had forgot the reward <SENTENCE-END>

    facd spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills a man
    full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
    thatby chance i found <SENTENCE-END>  it beggars any man that keeps it <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is turnd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing
    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
    to himself and live without it <SENTENCE-END> 
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  zounds tis even now at my elbow
    persuading me not to kill the duke <SENTENCE-END> 
  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  take the devil in thy mind and believe

    reputation <SENTENCE-END>  come shall we fall to work
  first murderer <SENTENCE-END>  take him on the costard with the hilts of
    thy sword and then chop him in the malmseybutt in the
    next room <SENTENCE-END>

  second murderer <SENTENCE-END>  to to to
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  to murder me
  both murderers <SENTENCE-END>  ay ay <SENTENCE-END> 
  clarence <SENTENCE-END>  you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so

    spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
    take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand
    to hurl upon their heads that break his law <SENTENCE-END>

    thou didst receive the sacrament to fight

    if god will be avenged for the deed
    o know you yet he doth it publicly <SENTENCE-END> 
    take not the quarrel from his powrful arm
    he needs no indirect or lawless course
    to cut off those that have offended him <SENTENCE-END>

    when gallantspringing brave plantagenet

  king edward <SENTENCE-END>  then say at once what is it thou requests <SENTENCE-END>

    who slew today a riotous gentleman
    lately attendant on the duke of norfolk <SENTENCE-END> 
  king edward <SENTENCE-END>  have i a tongue to doom my brothers death
    and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
    my brother killed no manhis fault was thought
    and yet his punishment was bitter death <SENTENCE-END> 
    who sued to me for him who in my wrath
    kneeld at my feet and bid me be advisd
    who spoke of brotherhood who spoke of love
    who told me how the poor soul did forsake
    the mighty warwick and did fight for me
    who told me in the field at tewksbury
    when oxford had me down he rescued me
    and said dear brother live and be a king
    who told me when we both lay in the field
    frozen almost to death how he did lap me
    even in his garments and did give himself
    all thin and naked to the numb cold night
    all this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
    sinfully pluckd and not a man of you
    had so much race to put it in my mind <SENTENCE-END> 
    but when your carters or your waitingvassals
    have done a drunken slaughter and defacd
    the precious image of our dear redeemer
    you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
    and i unjustly too must grant it you <SENTENCE-END>         derby rises
    but for my brother not a man would speak
    nor i ungracious speak unto myself
    for him poor soul <SENTENCE-END>  the proudest of you all
    have been beholding to him in his life
    yet none of you would once beg for his life <SENTENCE-END> 
    o god i fear thy justice will take hold
    on me and you and mine and yours for this
    come hastings help me to my closet <SENTENCE-END>  ah poor clarence
                                 exeunt some with king and queen
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  this is the fruits of rashness <SENTENCE-END>  markd you not
    how that the guilty kindred of the queen
    lookd pale when they did hear of clarence death
    o they did urge it still unto the king  
    god will revenge it <SENTENCE-END>  come lords will you go
    to comfort edward with our company
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  we wait upon your grace <SENTENCE-END>                     exeunt

  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  sister have comfort <SENTENCE-END>  all of us have cause
    to wail the dimming of our shining star
    but none can help our harms by wailing them <SENTENCE-END> 
    madam my mother i do cry you mercy
    i did not see your grace <SENTENCE-END>  humbly on my knee  
    i crave your blessing <SENTENCE-END> 
  duchess <SENTENCE-END>  god bless thee and put meekness in thy breast
    love charity obedience and true duty
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  amen  aside  and make me die a good old
    man
    that is the butt end of a mothers blessing
    i marvel that her grace did leave it out <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing
    peers
    that bear this heavy mutual load of moan
    now cheer each other in each others love <SENTENCE-END> 
    though we have spent our harvest of this king
    we are to reap the harvest of his son <SENTENCE-END> 
    the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
    but lately splinterd knit and joind together
    must gently be preservd cherishd and kept <SENTENCE-END> 
    me seemeth good that with some little train
    forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet
    hither to london to be crownd our king <SENTENCE-END> 

 rivers <SENTENCE-END>  why with some little train my lord of  
    buckingham
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  marry my lord lest by a multitude
    the newheald wound of malice should break out
    which would be so much the more dangerous
    by how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd
    where every horse bears his commanding rein
    and may direct his course as please himself
    as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
    in my opinion ought to be prevented <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  i hope the king made peace with all of us
    and the compact is firm and true in me <SENTENCE-END> 
  rivers <SENTENCE-END>  and so in me and so i think in an <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet since it is but green it should be put
    to no apparent likelihood of breach
    which haply by much company might be urgd
    therefore i say with noble buckingham
    that it is meet so few should fetch the prince <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  and so say i <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  then be it so and go we to determine
    who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow <SENTENCE-END>   
    madam and you my sister will you go
    to give your censures in this business
                        exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  my lord whoever journeys to the prince
    for god sake let not us two stay at home
    for by the way ill sort occasion
    as index to the story we late talkd of
    to part the queens proud kindred from the prince <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  my other self my counsels consistory
    my oracle my prophet my dear cousin
    i as a child will go by thy direction <SENTENCE-END> 
    toward ludlow then for well not stay behind <SENTENCE-END>         exeunt

london <SENTENCE-END>  a street

enter one citizen at one door and another at the other

  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  good morrow neighbour <SENTENCE-END>  whither away so
    fast
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  i promise you i scarcely know myself <SENTENCE-END> 
    hear you the news abroad
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  yes that the king is dead <SENTENCE-END> 
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  ill news byr lady seldom comes the
    better <SENTENCE-END> 
    i fear i fear twill prove a giddy world <SENTENCE-END> 

                        enter another citizen

  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  neighbours god speed
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  give you good morrow sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  doth the news hold of good king edwards
    death
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  ay sir it is too true god help the while  
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  then masters look to see a troublous
    world <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  no no by gods good grace his son shall
    reign <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  woe to that land thats governd by a child <SENTENCE-END> 
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  in him there is a hope of government
    which in his nonage council under him
    and in his full and ripened years himself
    no doubt shall then and till then govern well <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  so stood the state when henry the sixth
    was crownd in paris but at nine months old <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  stood the state so no no good friends
    god wot
    for then this land was famously enrichd
    with politic grave counsel then the king
    had virtuous uncles to protect his grace <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  why so hath this both by his father and
    mother <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  better it were they all came by his father
    or by his father there were none at all  
    for emulation who shall now be nearest
    will touch us all too near if god prevent not <SENTENCE-END> 
    o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
    and the queens sons and brothers haught and proud
    and were they to be ruld and not to rule
    this sickly land might solace as before <SENTENCE-END> 
  first citizen <SENTENCE-END>  come come we fear the worst all will be
    well <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  when clouds are seen wise men put on
    their cloaks
    when great leaves fall then winter is at hand
    when the sun sets who doth not look for night
    untimely storms make men expect a dearth <SENTENCE-END> 
    all may be well but if god sort it so
    tis more than we deserve or i expect <SENTENCE-END> 
  second citizen <SENTENCE-END>  truly the hearts of men are fun of fear <SENTENCE-END> 
    you cannot reason almost with a man
    that looks not heavily and fun of dread <SENTENCE-END> 
  third citizen <SENTENCE-END>  before the days of change still is it so
    by a divine instinct mens minds mistrust  
    ensuing danger as by proof we see
    the water swell before a boistrous storm <SENTENCE-END> 
    but leave it all to god <SENTENCE-END>  whither away

london <SENTENCE-END>  a street

the trumpets sound <SENTENCE-END>  enter the prince of wales gloucester buckingham
catesby cardinal bourchier and others

  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  welcome sweet prince to london to your
    chamber <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign <SENTENCE-END> 
    the weary way hath made you melancholy <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  no uncle but our crosses on the way
    have made it tedious wearisome and heavy <SENTENCE-END> 
    i want more uncles here to welcome me <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  sweet prince the untainted virtue of your
    years
    hath not yet divd into the worlds deceit
    nor more can you distinguish of a man
    than of his outward show which god he knows
    seldom or never jumpeth with the heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    those uncles which you want were dangerous
    your grace attended to their sugred words  
    but lookd not on the poison of their hearts <SENTENCE-END> 
    god keep you from them and from such false friends
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  god keep me from false friends but they were
    none <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  my lord the mayor of london comes to greet
    you <SENTENCE-END> 

                enter the lord mayor and his train

  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  god bless your grace with health and happy days
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  i thank you good my lord and thank you all <SENTENCE-END> 
    i thought my mother and my brother york
    would long ere this have met us on the way <SENTENCE-END> 
    fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
    to tell us whether they will come or no

                        enter lord hastings

  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  and in good time here comes the sweating
    lord <SENTENCE-END>   
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  welcome my lord <SENTENCE-END>  what will our mother come
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  on what occasion god he knows not i
    the queen your mother and your brother york
    have taken sanctuary <SENTENCE-END>  the tender prince
    would fain have come with me to meet your grace
    but by his mother was perforce withheld <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  fie what an indirect and peevish course
    is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
    persuade the queen to send the duke of york
    unto his princely brother presently
    if she deny lord hastings go with him
    and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce <SENTENCE-END> 
  cardinal <SENTENCE-END>  my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
    can from his mother win the duke of york
    anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
    to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
    we should infringe the holy privilege
    of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
    would i be guilty of so deep a sin <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  you are too senselessobstinate my lord  
    too ceremonious and traditional <SENTENCE-END> 
    weigh it but with the grossness of this age
    you break not sanctuary in seizing him <SENTENCE-END> 
    the benefit thereof is always granted
    to those whose dealings have deservd the place
    and those who have the wit to claim the place <SENTENCE-END> 
    this prince hath neither claimd it nor deservd it
    and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it <SENTENCE-END> 
    then taking him from thence that is not there
    you break no privilege nor charter there <SENTENCE-END> 
    oft have i heard of sanctuary men
    but sanctuary children never till now <SENTENCE-END> 
  cardinal <SENTENCE-END>  my lord you shall oerrule my mind for once <SENTENCE-END> 
    come on lord hastings will you go with me
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  i go my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  good lords make all the speedy haste you may <SENTENCE-END>

    say uncle gloucester if our brother come
    where shall we sojourn till our coronation
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  where it seems best unto your royal self <SENTENCE-END>   
    if i may counsel you some day or two
    your highness shall repose you at the tower
    then where you please and shall be thought most fit
    for your best health and recreation <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  i do not like the tower of any place <SENTENCE-END> 
    did julius caesar build that place my lord
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  he did my gracious lord begin that place
    which since succeeding ages have reedified <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  is it upon record or else reported
    successively from age to age he built it
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  upon record my gracious lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  but say my lord it were not registred
    methinks the truth should eve from age to age
    as twere retaild to all posterity
    even to the general allending day <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>   aside  so wise so young they say do never
    live long <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  what say you uncle
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  i say without characters fame lives long <SENTENCE-END> 
    aside  thus like the formal vice iniquity  
    i moralize two meanings in one word <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  that julius caesar was a famous man
    with what his valour did enrich his wit
    his wit set down to make his valour live <SENTENCE-END> 
    death makes no conquest of this conqueror
    for now he lives in fame though not in life <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill tell you what my cousin buckingham
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  what my gracious lord
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  an if i live until i be a man
    ill win our ancient right in france again
    or die a soldier as i livd a king <SENTENCE-END>

  york <SENTENCE-END>  i thank you gentle uncle <SENTENCE-END>  o my lord

    the prince my brother hath outgrown me far <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  he hath my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  and therefore is he idle
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  o my fair cousin i must not say so <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  then he is more beholding to you than i <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  he may command me as my sovereign
    but you have power in me as in a kinsman <SENTENCE-END> 
  york <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you uncle give me this dagger <SENTENCE-END>

  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  it is too heavy for your grace to wear <SENTENCE-END>

  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
    to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle

  hastings <SENTENCE-END>   within  who knocks
  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  one from the lord stanley <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>   within  what ist oclock

                        enter lord hastings

  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  cannot my lord stanley sleep these tedious
    nights
  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  so it appears by that i have to say <SENTENCE-END> 
    first he commends him to your noble self <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  what then
  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  then certifies your lordship that this night
    he dreamt the boar had razed off his helm <SENTENCE-END> 
    besides he says there are two councils kept
    and that may be determind at the one  
    which may make you and him to rue at th other <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure
    if you will presently take horse with him
    and with all speed post with him toward the north
    to shun the danger that his soul divines <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  go fellow go return unto thy lord
    bid him not fear the separated council
    his honour and myself are at the one
    and at the other is my good friend catesby
    where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
    whereof i shall not have intelligence <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell him his fears are shallow without instance
    and for his dreams i wonder hes so simple
    to trust the mockry of unquiet slumbers <SENTENCE-END> 
    to fly the boar before the boar pursues
    were to incense the boar to follow us
    and make pursuit where he did mean no chase <SENTENCE-END> 
    go bid thy master rise and come to me
    and we will both together to the tower
    where he shall see the boar will use us kindly <SENTENCE-END>

    what news what news in this our tottring state
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  it is a reeling world indeed my lord
    and i believe will never stand upright

  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  how wear the garland dost thou mean the
    crown
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  ay my good lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  ill have this crown of mine cut from my
    shoulders
    before ill see the crown so foul misplacd <SENTENCE-END> 
    but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  ay on my life and hopes to find you forward
    upon his party for the gain thereof  
    and thereupon he sends you this good news
    that this same very day your enemies
    the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  indeed i am no mourner for that news
    because they have been still my adversaries
    but that ill give my voice on richards side
    to bar my masters heirs in true descent
    god knows i will not do it to the death <SENTENCE-END> 
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence
    that they which brought me in my masters hate
    i live to look upon their tragedy <SENTENCE-END> 
    well catesby ere a fortnight make me older
    ill send some packing that yet think not ont <SENTENCE-END> 
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
    when men are unprepard and look not for it <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
    with rivers vaughan grey and so twill do
    with some men else that think themselves as safe
    as thou and i who as thou knowest are dear  
    to princely richard and to buckingham <SENTENCE-END> 
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  the princes both make high account of you
    aside  for they account his head upon the bridge <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  i know they do and i have well deservd it <SENTENCE-END> 

                      enter lord stanley

    i do not like these several councils i <SENTENCE-END> 
  hastings <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i hold my life as dear as yours
    and never in my days i do protest
    was it so precious to me as tis now <SENTENCE-END>

  stanley <SENTENCE-END>  the lords at pomfret when they rode from
    london
    were jocund and supposd their states were sure  
    and they indeed had no cause to mistrust
    but yet you see how soon the day oercast <SENTENCE-END>

    lord

    the dangerous and unsuspected hastings <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  so dear i lovd the man that i must weep <SENTENCE-END> 
    i took him for the plainest harmless creature
    that breathd upon the earth a christian
    made him my book wherein my soul recorded
    the history of all her secret thoughts <SENTENCE-END> 
    so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue  
    that his apparent open guilt omitted
    i mean his conversation with shores wife
    he livd from all attainder of suspects <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  well well he was the covertst sheltred
    traitor
    that ever livd <SENTENCE-END>

    this day had plotted in the councilhouse
    to murder me and my good lord of gloucester <SENTENCE-END> 
  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  had he done so
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  what think you we are turks or infidels
    or that we would against the form of law
    proceed thus rashly in the villains death
    but that the extreme peril of the case
    the peace of england and our persons safety
    enforcd us to this execution
  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  now fair befall you he deservd his death
    and your good graces both have well proceeded  
    to warn false traitors from the like attempts <SENTENCE-END> 
    i never lookd for better at his hands
    after he once fell in with mistress shore <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  yet had we not determind he should die
    until your lordship came to see his end
    which now the loving haste of these our friends
    something against our meanings have prevented
    because my lord i would have had you heard
    the traitor speak and timorously confess
    the manner and the purpose of his treasons
    that you might well have signified the same
    unto the citizens who haply may
    misconster us in him and wail his death <SENTENCE-END> 
  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  but my good lord your graces words shall serve

    which by the sign thereof was termed so <SENTENCE-END> 
    moreover urge his hateful luxury
    and bestial appetite in change of lust
    which stretchd unto their servants daughters wives
    even where his raging eye or savage heart
    without control lusted to make a prey <SENTENCE-END> 
    nay for a need thus far come near my person
    tell them when that my mother went with child
    of that insatiate edward noble york  
    my princely father then had wars in france
    and by true computation of the time
    found that the issue was not his begot
    which well appeared in his lineaments
    being nothing like the noble duke my father <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet touch this sparingly as twere far off
    because my lord you know my mother lives <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  doubt not my lord ill play the orator

    the citizens are mum say not a word <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  touchd you the bastardy of edwards
    children
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  i did with his contract with lady lucy
    and his contract by deputy in france
    th insatiate greediness of his desire
    and his enforcement of the city wives
    his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
    as being got your father then in france
    and his resemblance being not like the duke <SENTENCE-END> 
    withal i did infer your lineaments
    being the right idea of your father
    both in your form and nobleness of mind
    laid open all your victories in scotland
    your discipline in war wisdom in peace  
    your bounty virtue fair humility
    indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
    untouchd or slightly handled in discourse <SENTENCE-END> 
    and when mine oratory drew toward end
    i bid them that did love their countrys good
    cry god save richard englands royal king
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  and did they so
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  no so god help me they spake not a word
    but like dumb statues or breathing stones
    stard each on other and lookd deadly pale <SENTENCE-END> 
    which when i saw i reprehended them
    and askd the mayor what meant this wilfull silence <SENTENCE-END> 
    his answer was the people were not used
    to be spoke to but by the recorder <SENTENCE-END> 
    then he was urgd to tell my tale again <SENTENCE-END> 
    thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd
    but nothing spoke in warrant from himself <SENTENCE-END> 
    when he had done some followers of mine own
    at lower end of the hall hurld up their caps
    and some ten voices cried god save king richard  
    and thus i took the vantage of those few
    thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i
    this general applause and cheerful shout
    argues your wisdoms and your love to richard <SENTENCE-END> 
    and even here brake off and came away <SENTENCE-END>

    be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
    and look you get a prayerbook in your hand

  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
    he is not lolling on a lewd lovebed
    but on his knees at meditation
    not dallying with a brace of courtezans
    but meditating with two deep divines
    not sleeping to engross his idle body
    but praying to enrich his watchful soul <SENTENCE-END> 
    happy were england would this virtuous prince
    take on his grace the sovereignty thereof
    but sure i fear we shall not win him to it <SENTENCE-END> 
  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  marry god defend his grace should say us nay

    by heaven we come to him in perfect love
    and so once more return and tell his grace <SENTENCE-END>

    and pardon us the interruption
    of thy devotion and right christian zeal <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  my lord there needs no such apology
    i do beseech your grace to pardon me
    who earnest in the service of my god
    deferrd the visitation of my friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    but leaving this what is your graces pleasure
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  even that i hope which pleaseth god above
    and all good men of this ungovernd isle <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  i do suspect i have done some offence
    that seems disgracious in the citys eye
    and that you come to reprehend my ignorance <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  you have my lord <SENTENCE-END>  would it might please
    your grace
    on our entreaties to amend your fault
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  know then it is your fault that you resign
    the supreme seat the throne majestical
    the sceptred office of your ancestors  
    your state of fortune and your due of birth
    the lineal glory of your royal house
    to the corruption of a blemishd stock
    whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
    which here we waken to our countrys good
    the noble isle doth want her proper limbs
    her face defacd with scars of infamy
    her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
    and almost shouldred in the swallowing gulf
    of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion <SENTENCE-END> 
    which to recure we heartily solicit
    your gracious self to take on you the charge
    and kingly government of this your land
    not as protector steward substitute
    or lowly factor for anothers gain
    but as successively from blood to blood
    your right of birth your empery your own <SENTENCE-END> 
    for this consorted with the citizens
    your very worshipful and loving friends
    and by their vehement instigation  
    in this just cause come i to move your grace <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot tell if to depart in silence
    or bitterly to speak in your reproof
    best fitteth my degree or your condition <SENTENCE-END> 
    if not to answer you might haply think
    tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
    to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
    which fondly you would here impose on me
    if to reprove you for this suit of yours
    so seasond with your faithful love to me
    then on the other side i checkd my friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    thereforeto speak and to avoid the first
    and then in speaking not to incur the last
    definitively thus i answer you
    your love deserves my thanks but my desert
    unmeritable shuns your high request <SENTENCE-END> 
    first if all obstacles were cut away
    and that my path were even to the crown
    as the ripe revenue and due of birth
    yet so much is my poverty of spirit  
    so mighty and so many my defects
    that i would rather hide me from my greatness
    being a bark to brook no mighty sea
    than in my greatness covet to be hid
    and in the vapour of my glory smotherd <SENTENCE-END> 
    but god be thankd there is no need of me
    and much i need to help you were there need <SENTENCE-END> 
    the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
    which mellowd by the stealing hours of time
    will well become the seat of majesty
    and make no doubt us happy by his reign <SENTENCE-END> 
    on him i lay that you would lay on me
    the right and fortune of his happy stars
    which god defend that i should wring from him <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  my lord this argues conscience in your
    grace
    but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
    all circumstances well considered <SENTENCE-END> 
    you say that edward is your brothers son <SENTENCE-END> 
    so say we too but not by edwards wife  
    for first was he contract to lady lucy
    your mother lives a witness to his vow
    and afterward by substitute betrothd
    to bona sister to the king of france <SENTENCE-END> 
    these both put off a poor petitioner
    a carecrazd mother to a many sons
    a beautywaning and distressed widow
    even in the afternoon of her best days
    made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
    seducd the pitch and height of his degree
    to base declension and loathd bigamy <SENTENCE-END> 
    by her in his unlawful bed he got
    this edward whom our manners call the prince <SENTENCE-END> 
    more bitterly could i expostulate
    save that for reverence to some alive
    i give a sparing limit to my tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
    then good my lord take to your royal self
    this profferd benefit of dignity
    if not to bless us and the land withal
    yet to draw forth your noble ancestry  
    from the corruption of abusing times
    unto a lineal truederived course <SENTENCE-END> 
  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  do good my lord your citizens entreat you <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  refuse not mighty lord this profferd love <SENTENCE-END> 
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  alas why would you heap this care on me
    i am unfit for state and majesty <SENTENCE-END> 
    i do beseech you take it not amiss
    i cannot nor i will not yield to you <SENTENCE-END> 
  buckingham <SENTENCE-END>  if you refuse itas in love and zeal
    loath to depose the child your brothers son
    as well we know your tenderness of heart
    and gentle kind effeminate remorse
    which we have noted in you to your kindred
    and egally indeed to all estates
    yet know wheer you accept our suit or no
    your brothers son shall never reign our king
    but we will plant some other in the throne
    to the disgrace and downfall of your house
    and in this resolution here we leave you <SENTENCE-END>   
    come citizens <SENTENCE-END>  zounds ill entreat no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  o do not swear my lord of buckingham <SENTENCE-END> 
                          exeunt buckingham mayor and citizens
  catesby <SENTENCE-END>  call him again sweet prince accept their suit <SENTENCE-END> 
    if you deny them all the land will rue it <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  will you enforce me to a world of cares
    call them again <SENTENCE-END>  i am not made of stones
    but penetrable to your kind entreaties
    albeit against my conscience and my soul <SENTENCE-END> 

                  reenter buckingham and the rest

    cousin of buckingham and sage grave men
    since you will buckle fortune on my back
    to bear her burden wheer i will or no
    i must have patience to endure the load
    but if black scandal or foulfacd reproach
    attend the sequel of your imposition
    your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
    from all the impure blots and stains thereof  
    for god doth know and you may partly see
    how far i am from the desire of this <SENTENCE-END> 
  mayor <SENTENCE-END>  god bless your grace we see it and will say it <SENTENCE-END> 
  gloucester <SENTENCE-END>  in saying so you shall but say the truth <SENTENCE-END>

enter tyrrel

  tyrrel <SENTENCE-END>  the tyrannous and bloody act is done
    the most arch deed of piteous massacre
    that ever yet this land was guilty of <SENTENCE-END> 
    dighton and forrest who i did suborn
    to do this piece of ruthless butchery
    albeit they were fleshd villains bloody dogs
    melted with tenderness and mild compassion
    wept like two children in their deaths sad story <SENTENCE-END> 
    o thus quoth dighton lay the gentle babes
    thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another
    within their alabaster innocent arms <SENTENCE-END> 
    their lips were four red roses on a stalk
    and in their summer beauty kissd each other <SENTENCE-END> 
    a book of prayers on their pillow lay
    which once quoth forrest almost changd my mind
    but o the devilthere the villain stoppd
    when dighton thus told on we smothered  
    the most replenished sweet work of nature
    that from the prime creation eer she framed <SENTENCE-END> 
    hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
    they could not speak and so i left them both

      fortune
    i calld thee then poor shadow painted queen
    the presentation of but what i was  
    the flattering index of a direful pageant
    one heavd ahigh to be hurld down below
    a mother only mockd with two fair babes
    a dream of what thou wast a garish flag
    to be the aim of every dangerous shot
    a sign of dignity a breath a bubble
    a queen in jest only to fill the scene <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
    where be thy two sons wherein dost thou joy
    who sues and kneels and says god save the queen
    where be the bending peers that flattered thee
    where be the thronging troops that followed thee
    decline an this and see what now thou art
    for happy wife a most distressed widow
    for joyful mother one that wails the name
    for one being sud to one that humbly sues
    for queen a very caitiff crownd with care
    for she that scornd at me now scornd of me
    for she being feard of all now fearing one
    for she commanding all obeyd of none <SENTENCE-END>   
    thus hath the course of justice whirld about
    and left thee but a very prey to time
    having no more but thought of what thou wast
    to torture thee the more being what thou art <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
    usurp the just proportion of my sorrow

    and he that slew them fouler than he is <SENTENCE-END> 
    bettring thy loss makes the badcauser worse
    revolving this will teach thee how to curse <SENTENCE-END>

    tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
    thy schooldays frightful desprate wild and furious
    thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
    thy age confirmd proud subtle sly and bloody  
    more mild but yet more harmfulkind in hatred <SENTENCE-END>

    therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
    which in the day of battle tire thee more  
    than all the complete armour that thou wearst
    my prayers on the adverse party fight
    and there the little souls of edwards children

    and promise them success and victory <SENTENCE-END>

    whose hand soever lancd their tender hearts
    thy head an indirectly gave direction <SENTENCE-END> 
    no doubt the murdrous knife was dull and blunt
    till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
    to revel in the entrails of my lambs <SENTENCE-END> 
    but that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame
    my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
    till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes
    and i in such a desprate bay of death
    like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
    rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom <SENTENCE-END>

    which thou supposest i have done to thee <SENTENCE-END>

    daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  my daughters mother thinks it with her
    soul <SENTENCE-END>   
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  what do you think
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  that thou dost love my daughter from
      thy soul <SENTENCE-END> 
    so from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers
    and from my hearts love i do thank thee for it <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  be not so hasty to confound my meaning <SENTENCE-END> 
    i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter
    and do intend to make her queen of england <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  well then who dost thou mean shall be
    her king
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  even he that makes her queen <SENTENCE-END>  who else
    should be

  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  how canst thou woo her
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  that would i learn of you
    as one being best acquainted with her humour <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  and wilt thou learn of me
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  madam with all my heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  send to her by the man that slew her  
    brothers
    a pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave
    edward and york <SENTENCE-END>  then haply will she weep
    therefore present to heras sometimes margaret
    did to thy father steepd in rutlands blood
    a handkerchief which say to her did drain
    the purple sap from her sweet brothers body
    and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal <SENTENCE-END> 
    if this inducement move her not to love
    send her a letter of thy noble deeds
    tell her thou madst away her uncle clarence

  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  you mock me madam this is not the way
    to win your daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  there is no other way
    unless thou couldst put on some other shape
    and not be richard that hath done all this <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  say that i did all this for love of her <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  nay then indeed she cannot choose but  
      hate thee
    having bought love with such a bloody spoil <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  look what is done cannot be now amended <SENTENCE-END> 
    men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
    which afterhours gives leisure to repent <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i did take the kingdom from your sons
    to make amends ill give it to your daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i have killd the issue of your womb
    to quicken your increase i will beget
    mine issue of your blood upon your daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
    a grandams name is little less in love
    than is the doating title of a mother
    they are as children but one step below
    even of your metal of your very blood
    of all one pain save for a night of groans
    endurd of her for whom you bid like sorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
    your children were vexation to your youth
    but mine shall be a comfort to your age <SENTENCE-END> 
    the loss you have is but a son being king
    and by that loss your daughter is made queen <SENTENCE-END>   
    i cannot make you what amends i would
    therefore accept such kindness as i can <SENTENCE-END> 
    dorset your son that with a fearful soul
    leads discontented steps in foreign soil
    this fair alliance quickly shall can home
    to high promotions and great dignity <SENTENCE-END> 
    the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
    familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
    again shall you be mother to a king
    and all the ruins of distressful times
    repaird with double riches of content <SENTENCE-END> 
    what we have many goodly days to see <SENTENCE-END> 
    the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
    shall come again transformd to orient pearl
    advantaging their loan with interest
    of ten times double gain of happiness <SENTENCE-END> 
    go then my mother to thy daughter go
    make bold her bashful years with your experience
    prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale
    put in her tender heart th aspiring flame  
    of golden sovereignty acquaint the princes
    with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys <SENTENCE-END> 
    and when this arm of mine hath chastised
    the petty rebel dullbraind buckingham
    bound with triumphant garlands will i come
    and lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed
    to whom i will retail my conquest won
    and she shall be sole victoress caesars caesar <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  what were i best to say her fathers
      brother
    would be her lord or shall i say her uncle
    or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
    under what title shall i woo for thee
    that god the law my honour and her love
    can make seem pleasing to her tender years
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  infer fair englands peace by this alliance <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  which she shall purchase with
    stilllasting war <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  tell her the king that may command
    entreats <SENTENCE-END>   
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  that at her hands which the kings
    king forbids <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  say she shall be a high and mighty queen <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  to wail the title as her mother doth <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  say i will love her everlastingly <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  but how long shall that title ever last
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  but how long fairly shall her sweet life
    last
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  as long as heaven and nature lengthens it <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  as long as hell and richard likes of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  say i her sovereign am her subject low <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  but she your subject loathes such
    sovereignty <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  be eloquent in my behalf to her <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  an honest tale speeds best being plainly
    told <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  then plainly to her tell my loving tale <SENTENCE-END> 
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  plain and not honest is too harsh a style <SENTENCE-END> 
  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  your reasons are too shallow and too quick <SENTENCE-END>   
  queen elizabeth <SENTENCE-END>  o no my reasons are too deep and
      dead

  king richard <SENTENCE-END>  harp not on that string madam that is past <SENTENCE-END>

    for want of means poor rats had hangd themselves <SENTENCE-END> 
    if we be conquered let men conquer us
    and not these bastard britaines whom our fathers
    have in their own land beaten bobbd and thumpd

    the fiery tybalt with his sword prepard
    which as he breathd defiance to my ears
    he swung about his head and cut the winds
    who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn <SENTENCE-END>

    right glad i am he was not at this fray <SENTENCE-END> 
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  madam an hour before the worshippd sun
    peerd forth the golden window of the east
    a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
    where underneath the grove of sycamore
    that westward rooteth from the citys side  
    so early walking did i see your son <SENTENCE-END> 
    towards him i made but he was ware of me
    and stole into the covert of the wood <SENTENCE-END> 
    i measuring his affections by my own
    which then most sought where most might not be found
    being one too many by my weary self
    pursud my humour not pursuing his
    and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me <SENTENCE-END> 
  mon <SENTENCE-END>  many a morning hath he there been seen
    with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
    adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
    but all so soon as the allcheering sun
    should in the farthest east bean to draw
    the shady curtains from auroras bed
    away from light steals home my heavy son
    and private in his chamber pens himself
    shuts up his windows locks fair daylight
    and makes himself an artificial night <SENTENCE-END> 
    black and portentous must this humour prove
    unless good counsel may the cause remove <SENTENCE-END>   
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  my noble uncle do you know the cause
  mon <SENTENCE-END>  i neither know it nor can learn of him
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  have you importund him by any means
  mon <SENTENCE-END>  both by myself and many other friend
    but he his own affections counsellor
    is to himself i will not say how true
    but to himself so secret and so close
    so far from sounding and discovery
    as is the bud bit with an envious worm
    ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    or dedicate his beauty to the sun <SENTENCE-END> 
    could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
    we would as willingly give cure as know <SENTENCE-END>

  rom <SENTENCE-END>  what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
    or shall we on without apology
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  the date is out of such prolixity <SENTENCE-END> 
    well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
    bearing a tartars painted bow of lath
    scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
    nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
    after the prompter for our entrance
    but let them measure us by what they will
    well measure them a measure and be gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  give me a torch <SENTENCE-END>  i am not for this ambling <SENTENCE-END>

  mer <SENTENCE-END>  you are a lover <SENTENCE-END>  borrow cupids wings
    and soar with them above a common bound <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    to soar with his light feathers and so bound
    i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe <SENTENCE-END> 
    under loves heavy burthen do i sink <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  and to sink in it should you burthen love
    too great oppression for a tender thing <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  is love a tender thing it is too rough
    too rude too boistrous and it pricks like thorn <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  if love be rough with you be rough with love <SENTENCE-END> 
    prick love for pricking and you beat love down <SENTENCE-END> 
    give me a case to put my visage in <SENTENCE-END> 
    a visor for a visor what care i
    what curious eye doth quote deformities
    here are the beetle brows shall blush for me <SENTENCE-END> 
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  come knock and enter and no sooner in
    but every man betake him to his legs <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  a torch for me let wantons light of heart
    tickle the senseless rushes with their heels  
    for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
    ill be a candleholder and look on
    the game was neer so fair and i am done <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  tut duns the mouse the constables own word
    if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
    of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
    up to the ears <SENTENCE-END>  come we burn daylight ho
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  nay thats not so <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  i mean sir in delay
    we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day <SENTENCE-END> 
    take our good meaning for our judgment sits
    five times in that ere once in our five wits <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  and we mean well in going to this masque
    but tis no wit to go <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  why may one ask
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  i dreamt a dream tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  and so did i <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  well what was yours
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  that dreamers often lie <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  in bed asleep while they do dream things true <SENTENCE-END>   
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  o then i see queen mab hath been with you <SENTENCE-END> 
    she is the fairies midwife and she comes
    in shape no bigger than an agate stone
    on the forefinger of an alderman
    drawn with a team of little atomies
    athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
    her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs
    the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
    her traces of the smallest spiders web
    her collars of the moonshines watry beams
    her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
    her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
    not half so big as a round little worm
    prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
    her chariot is an empty hazelnut
    made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
    time out o mind the fairies coachmakers <SENTENCE-END> 
    and in this state she gallops night by night
    through lovers brains and then they dream of love
    oer courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight  
    oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
    oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
    which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
    because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are <SENTENCE-END> 
    sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
    and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
    and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
    tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
    then dreams he of another benefice <SENTENCE-END> 
    sometimes she driveth oer a soldiers neck
    and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
    of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
    of healths five fadom deep and then anon
    drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
    and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    and sleeps again <SENTENCE-END>  this is that very mab
    that plats the manes of horses in the night
    and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
    which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    this is the hag when maids lie on their backs  
    that presses them and learns them first to bear
    making them women of good carriage <SENTENCE-END> 
    this is she
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  peace peace mercutio peace
    thou talkst of nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  mer <SENTENCE-END>  true i talk of dreams
    which are the children of an idle brain
    begot of nothing but vain fantasy
    which is as thin of substance as the air
    and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
    even now the frozen bosom of the north
    and being angerd puffs away from thence
    turning his face to the dewdropping south <SENTENCE-END> 
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves <SENTENCE-END> 
    supper is done and we shall come too late <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  i fear too early for my mind misgives
    some consequence yet hanging in the stars
    shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    with this nights revels and expire the term
    of a despised life closd in my breast  
    by some vile forfeit of untimely death <SENTENCE-END> 
    but he that hath the steerage of my course
    direct my sail on lusty gentlemen
  ben <SENTENCE-END>  strike drum <SENTENCE-END> 
                           they march about the stage <SENTENCE-END>  exeunt <SENTENCE-END>

  chor <SENTENCE-END>  now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
    and young affection gapes to be his heir
    that fair for which love groand for and would die
    with tender juliet matchd is now not fair <SENTENCE-END> 
    now romeo is belovd and loves again
    alike bewitched by the charm of looks
    but to his foe supposd he must complain
    and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks <SENTENCE-END> 
    being held a foe he may not have access
    to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
    and she as much in love her means much less
    to meet her new beloved anywhere
    but passion lends them power time means to meet
    tempring extremities with extreme sweet <SENTENCE-END>

  rom <SENTENCE-END>  he jests at scars that never felt a wound <SENTENCE-END> 

                     enter juliet above at a window <SENTENCE-END> 

    but soft what light through yonder window breaks
    it is the east and juliet is the sun
    arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
    who is already sick and pale with grief
    that thou her maid art far more fair than she <SENTENCE-END> 
    be not her maid since she is envious <SENTENCE-END> 
    her vestal livery is but sick and green
    and none but fools do wear it <SENTENCE-END>  cast it off <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is my lady o it is my love
    o that she knew she were
    she speaks yet she says nothing <SENTENCE-END>  what of that
    her eye discourses i will answer it <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am too bold tis not to me she speaks <SENTENCE-END>   
    two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
    having some business do entreat her eyes
    to twinkle in their spheres till they return <SENTENCE-END> 
    what if her eyes were there they in her head
    the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
    would through the airy region stream so bright
    that birds would sing and think it were not night <SENTENCE-END> 
    see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
    o that i were a glove upon that hand
    that i might touch that cheek
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  ay me
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  she speaks <SENTENCE-END> 
    o speak again bright angel for thou art
    as glorious to this night being oer my head
    as is a winged messenger of heaven
    unto the whiteupturned wondring eyes
    of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
    and sails upon the bosom of the air <SENTENCE-END>   
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
    deny thy father and refuse thy name
    or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
    and ill no longer be a capulet <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  tis but thy name that is my enemy <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou art thyself though not a montague <SENTENCE-END> 
    whats montague it is nor hand nor foot
    nor arm nor face nor any other part
    belonging to a man <SENTENCE-END>  o be some other name
    whats in a name that which we call a rose
    by any other name would smell as sweet <SENTENCE-END> 
    so romeo would were he not romeo calld
    retain that dear perfection which he owes
    without that title <SENTENCE-END>  romeo doff thy name
    and for that name which is no part of thee
    take all myself <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  i take thee at thy word <SENTENCE-END>

friar laurences cell <SENTENCE-END> 

enter friar laurence alone with a basket <SENTENCE-END> 

  friar <SENTENCE-END>  the greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night
    checkring the eastern clouds with streaks of light
    and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    from forth days path and titans fiery wheels <SENTENCE-END> 
    non ere the sun advance his burning eye
    the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
    i must upfill this osier cage of ours
    with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers <SENTENCE-END> 
    the earth thats natures mother is her tomb <SENTENCE-END> 
    what is her burying gave that is her womb
    and from her womb children of divers kind
    we sucking on her natural bosom find
    many for many virtues excellent
    none but for some and yet all different <SENTENCE-END> 
    o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    in plants herbs stones and their true qualities
    for naught so vile that on the earth doth live  
    but to the earth some special good doth give
    nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
    revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse <SENTENCE-END> 
    virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
    and vice sometimes by action dignified <SENTENCE-END> 
    within the infant rind of this small flower
    poison hath residence and medicine power
    for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
    being tasted slays all senses with the heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    two such opposed kings encamp them still
    in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
    and where the worser is predominant
    full soon the canker death eats up that plant <SENTENCE-END> 

                        enter romeo <SENTENCE-END>

    so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed <SENTENCE-END> 
    care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
    and where care lodges sleep will never lie
    but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
    doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    thou art uprousd with some distemprature
    or if not so then here i hit it right
    our romeo hath not been in bed tonight <SENTENCE-END>

    on the fair daughter of rich capulet

    we met we wood and made exchange of vow
    ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray
    that thou consent to marry us today <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  holy saint francis what a change is here
    is rosaline that thou didst love so dear
    so soon forsaken young mens love then lies
    not truly in their hearts but in their eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    jesu maria what a deal of brine
    hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
    how much salt water thrown away in waste
    to season love that of it doth not taste
    the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears  
    thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears <SENTENCE-END> 
    lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    of an old tear that is not washd off yet <SENTENCE-END> 
    if eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
    thou and these woes were all for rosaline <SENTENCE-END> 
    and art thou changd pronounce this sentence then
    women may fall when theres no strength in men <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline <SENTENCE-END>

  rom <SENTENCE-END>  and badst me bury love <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  not in a grave
    to lay one in another out to have <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee chide not <SENTENCE-END>  she whom i love now
    doth grace for grace and love for love allow <SENTENCE-END> 
    the other did not so <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  o she knew well
    thy love did read by rote that could not spell <SENTENCE-END> 
    but come young waverer come go with me <SENTENCE-END> 
    in one respect ill thy assistant be
    for this alliance may so happy prove  
    to turn your households rancour to pure love <SENTENCE-END> 
  rom <SENTENCE-END>  o let us hence i stand on sudden haste <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  wisely and slow <SENTENCE-END>  they stumble that run fast <SENTENCE-END>

    and in the taste confounds the appetite <SENTENCE-END>

    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth <SENTENCE-END>   
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  come come with me and we will make short work
    for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
    till holy church incorporate two in one <SENTENCE-END>

    how nice the quarrel was and urgd withal
    your high displeasure <SENTENCE-END>  all this uttered
    with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd  
    could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
    with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast
    who all as hot turns deadly point to point
    and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
    cold death aside and with the other sends
    it back to tybalt whose dexterity
    retorts it <SENTENCE-END>  romeo he cries aloud
    hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue
    his agile arm beats down their fatal points
    and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
    an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
    of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
    but byandby comes back to romeo
    who had but newly entertaind revenge
    and tot they go like lightning for ere i
    could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
    and as he fell did romeo turn and fly <SENTENCE-END>

  jul <SENTENCE-END>  gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
    towards phoebus lodging such a wagoner
    as phaeton would whip you to the west
    and bring in cloudy night immediately <SENTENCE-END> 
    spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
    that runaway eyes may wink and romeo
    leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen <SENTENCE-END>

    and learn me how to lose a winning match
    playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods <SENTENCE-END>

    with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
    think true love acted simple modesty <SENTENCE-END> 
    come night come romeo come thou day in night  
    for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    whiter than new snow upon a ravens back <SENTENCE-END> 
    come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
    give me my romeo and when he shall die
    take him and cut him out in little stars
    and he will make the face of heaven so fine
    that all the world will be in love with night
    and pay no worship to the garish sun <SENTENCE-END> 
    o i have bought the mansion of a love
    but not possessd it and though i am sold
    not yet enjoyd <SENTENCE-END>  so tedious is this day

    and may not wear them <SENTENCE-END>  o here comes my nurse

                enter nurse with cords <SENTENCE-END> 

    and she brings news and every tongue that speaks

    though heaven cannot <SENTENCE-END>  o romeo romeo
    who ever would have thought it romeo
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
    this torture should be roard in dismal hell <SENTENCE-END> 
    hath romeo slain himself say thou but i
    and that bare vowel i shall poison more
    than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am not i if there be such an i
    or those eyes shut that make thee answer i <SENTENCE-END> 
    if be be slain say i or if not no <SENTENCE-END> 
    brief sounds determine of my weal or woe <SENTENCE-END>   
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes
    god save the mark here on his manly breast <SENTENCE-END> 
    a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
    pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
    all in goreblood <SENTENCE-END>  i swounded at the sight <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  o break my heart poor bankrout break at once
    to prison eyes neer look on liberty
    vile earth to earth resign end motion here
    and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
    o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
    that ever i should live to see thee dead
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  what storm is this that blows so contrary
    is romeo slaughtred and is tybalt dead
    my dearlovd cousin and my dearer lord
    then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
    for who is living if those two are gone
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  tybalt is gone and romeo banished
    romeo that killd him he is banished <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  o god did romeos hand shed tybalts blood  
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  it did it did alas the day it did
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  o serpent heart hid with a flowring face
    did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
    beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
    dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
    despised substance of divinest show
    just opposite to what thou justly seemst
    a damned saint an honourable villain
    o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
    when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
    was ever book containing such vile matter
    so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
    in such a gorgeous palace
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  theres no trust
    no faith no honesty in men all perjurd
    all forsworn all naught all dissemblers <SENTENCE-END> 
    ah wheres my man give me some aqua vitae <SENTENCE-END> 
    these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old <SENTENCE-END> 
    shame come to romeo  
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  blisterd be thy tongue
    for such a wish he was not born to shame <SENTENCE-END> 
    upon his brow shame is ashamd to sit
    for tis a throne where honour may be crownd
    sole monarch of the universal earth <SENTENCE-END> 
    o what a beast was i to chide at him
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  will you speak well of him that killd your cousin
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
    ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
    when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
    but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
    that villain cousin would have killd my husband <SENTENCE-END> 
    back foolish tears back to your native spring
    your tributary drops belong to woe
    which you mistaking offer up to joy <SENTENCE-END> 
    my husband lives that tybalt would have slain
    and tybalts dead that would have slain my husband <SENTENCE-END> 
    all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
    some word there was worser than tybalts death
    that murdred me <SENTENCE-END>  i would forget it fain  
    but o it presses to my memory
    like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
    tybalt is dead and romeo banished <SENTENCE-END> 
    that banished that one word banished
    hath slain ten thousand tybalts <SENTENCE-END>  tybalts death
    was woe enough if it had ended there
    or if sour woe delights in fellowship
    and needly will be rankd with other griefs
    why followed not when she said tybalts dead
    thy father or thy mother nay or both
    which modern lamentation might have movd
    but with a rearward following tybalts death
    romeo is banished to speak that word
    is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
    all slain all dead <SENTENCE-END>  romeo is banished
    there is no end no limit measure bound
    in that words death no words can that woe sound <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is my father and my mother nurse
  nurse <SENTENCE-END>  weeping and wailing over tybalts corse <SENTENCE-END> 
    will you go to them i will bring you thither <SENTENCE-END>

    when theirs are dry for romeos banishment <SENTENCE-END>

    and then down falls again <SENTENCE-END>

    hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself

    digressing from the valour of a man
    thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
    killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
    thy wit that ornament to shape and love
    misshapen in the conduct of them both
    like powder in a skilless soldiers flask

    the law that threatned death becomes thy friend
    and turns it to exile <SENTENCE-END>  there art thou happy <SENTENCE-END> 
    a pack of blessings light upon thy back
    happiness courts thee in her best array
    but like a misbhavd and sullen wench

    take heed take heed for such die miserable <SENTENCE-END> 
    go get thee to thy love as was decreed
    ascend her chamber hence and comfort her <SENTENCE-END> 
    but look thou stay not till the watch be set
    for then thou canst not pass to mantua
    where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
    beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
    with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    than thou wentst forth in lamentation <SENTENCE-END>

act iv <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
friar laurences cell <SENTENCE-END> 

enter friar laurence and county paris <SENTENCE-END> 

  friar <SENTENCE-END>  on thursday sir the time is very short <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  my father capulet will have it so
    and i am nothing slow to slack his haste <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  you say you do not know the ladys mind <SENTENCE-END> 
    uneven is the course i like it not <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  immoderately she weeps for tybalts death
    and therefore have i little talkd of love
    for venus smiles not in a house of tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    now sir her father counts it dangerous
    that she do give her sorrow so much sway
    and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    to stop the inundation of her tears
    which too much minded by herself alone
    may be put from her by society <SENTENCE-END> 
    now do you know the reason of this haste <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  aside i would i knew not why it should be slowd <SENTENCE-END> 
    look sir here comes the lady toward my cell <SENTENCE-END>   

                    enter juliet <SENTENCE-END> 

  par <SENTENCE-END>  happily met my lady and my wife
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  that may be sir when i may be a wife <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  that may be must be love on thursday next <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  what must be shall be <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  thats a certain text <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  come you to make confession to this father
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  to answer that i should confess to you <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  do not deny to him that you love me <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  i will confess to you that i love him <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  so will ye i am sure that you love me <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  if i do so it will be of more price
    being spoke behind your back than to your face <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  the tears have got small victory by that
    for it was bad enough before their spite <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  thou wrongst it more than tears with that report <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  that is no slander sir which is a truth  
    and what i spake i spake it to my face <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  thy face is mine and thou hast slandred it <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  it may be so for it is not mine own <SENTENCE-END> 
    are you at leisure holy father now
    or shall i come to you at evening mass
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  my leisure serves me pensive daughter now <SENTENCE-END> 
    my lord we must entreat the time alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  par <SENTENCE-END>  god shield i should disturb devotion
    juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye <SENTENCE-END> 
    till then adieu and keep this holy kiss <SENTENCE-END>              exit <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  o shut the door and when thou hast done so
    come weep with me past hope past cure past help
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  ah juliet i already know thy grief
    it strains me past the compass of my wits <SENTENCE-END> 
    i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
    on thursday next be married to this county <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
    unless thou tell me how i may prevent it <SENTENCE-END> 
    if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
    do thou but call my resolution wise  
    and with this knife ill help it presently <SENTENCE-END> 
    god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands
    and ere this hand by thee to romeos seald
    shall be the label to another deed
    or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    turn to another this shall slay them both <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore out of thy longexperiencd time
    give me some present counsel or behold
    twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    shall play the empire arbitrating that
    which the commission of thy years and art
    could to no issue of true honour bring <SENTENCE-END> 
    be not so long to speak <SENTENCE-END>  i long to die
    if what thou speakst speak not of remedy <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  hold daughter <SENTENCE-END>  i do spy a kind of hope
    which craves as desperate an execution
    as that is desperate which we would prevent <SENTENCE-END> 
    if rather than to marry county paris
    thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
    then is it likely thou wilt undertake  
    a thing like death to chide away this shame
    that copst with death himself to scape from it
    and if thou darst ill give thee remedy <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  o bid me leap rather than marry paris
    from off the battlements of yonder tower
    or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
    where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
    or shut me nightly in a charnel house
    oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
    with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
    or bid me go into a newmade grave
    and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
    things that to hear them told have made me tremble
    and i will do it without fear or doubt
    to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  hold then <SENTENCE-END>  go home be merry give consent
    to marry paris <SENTENCE-END>  wednesday is tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
    tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
    let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber <SENTENCE-END> 
    take thou this vial being then in bed  
    and this distilled liquor drink thou off
    when presently through all thy veins shall run
    a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
    shall keep his native progress but surcease
    no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
    the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
    like death when he shuts up the day of life
    each part deprivd of supple government
    shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
    and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    thou shalt continue twoandforty hours
    and then awake as from a pleasant sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
    now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead <SENTENCE-END> 
    then as the manner of our country is
    in thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    where all the kindred of the capulets lie <SENTENCE-END> 
    in the mean time against thou shalt awake  
    shall romeo by my letters know our drift
    and hither shall he come and he and i
    will watch thy waking and that very night
    shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua <SENTENCE-END> 
    and this shall free thee from this present shame
    if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    abate thy valour in the acting it <SENTENCE-END> 
  jul <SENTENCE-END>  give me give me o tell not me of fear
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
    in this resolve <SENTENCE-END>  ill send a friar with speed
    to mantua with my letters to thy lord <SENTENCE-END>

    my dismal scene i needs must act alone <SENTENCE-END> 
    come vial <SENTENCE-END> 
    what if this mixture do not work at all
    shall i be married then tomorrow morning
    no no this shall forbid it <SENTENCE-END>  lie thou there <SENTENCE-END> 
                                             lays down a dagger <SENTENCE-END> 
    what if it be a poison which the friar
    subtilly hath ministred to have me dead
    lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
    because he married me before to romeo
    i fear it is and yet methinks it should not
    for he hath still been tried a holy man <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will not entertain so bad a thought <SENTENCE-END> 
    how if when i am laid into the tomb  
    i wake before the time that romeo
    come to redeem me theres a fearful point
    shall i not then be stifled in the vault
    to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
    and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
    or if i live is it not very like
    the horrible conceit of death and night
    together with the terror of the place
    as in a vault an ancient receptacle
    where for this many hundred years the bones
    of all my buried ancestors are packd
    where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
    lies festring in his shroud where as they say
    at some hours in the night spirits resort
    alack alack is it not like that i
    so early waking what with loathsome smells
    and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
    that living mortals hearing them run mad
    o if i wake shall i not be distraught
    environed with all these hideous fears  
    and madly play with my forefathers joints
    and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud <SENTENCE-END> 
    and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
    as with a club dash out my desprate brains
    o look methinks i see my cousins ghost
    seeking out romeo that did spit his body
    upon a rapiers point <SENTENCE-END>  stay tybalt stay
    romeo i come this do i drink to thee <SENTENCE-END> 

        she drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtains <SENTENCE-END>

    lets see for means <SENTENCE-END>  o mischief thou art swift
    to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
    i do remember an apothecary
    and hereabouts a dwells which late i noted
    in tattred weeds with overwhelming brows
    culling of simples <SENTENCE-END>  meagre were his looks
    sharp misery had worn him to the bones
    and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
    an alligator stuffd and other skins
    of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
    a beggarly account of empty boxes
    green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
    remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
    were thinly scattered to make up a show <SENTENCE-END> 
    noting this penury to myself i said
    an if a man did need a poison now
    whose sale is present death in mantua  
    here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him <SENTENCE-END> 
    o this same thought did but forerun my need

    the obsequies that i for thee will keep
    nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep <SENTENCE-END>

    a precious ring a ring that i must use
    in dear employment <SENTENCE-END>  therefore hence be gone <SENTENCE-END>   
    but if thou jealous dost return to pry

  prince <SENTENCE-END>  then say it once what thou dost know in this <SENTENCE-END> 
  friar <SENTENCE-END>  i will be brief for my short date of breath
    is not so long as is a tedious tale <SENTENCE-END> 
    romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
    and she there dead that romeos faithful wife <SENTENCE-END> 
    i married them and their stoln marriage day
    was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
    banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city
    for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind <SENTENCE-END> 
    you to remove that siege of grief from her  
    betrothd and would have married her perforce
    to county paris <SENTENCE-END>  then comes she to me
    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    to rid her from this second marriage
    or in my cell there would she kill herself <SENTENCE-END> 
    then gave i her so tutored by my art
    a sleeping potion which so took effect
    as i intended for it wrought on her
    the form of death <SENTENCE-END>  meantime i writ to romeo
    that he should hither come as this dire night
    to help to take her from her borrowed grave
    being the time the potions force should cease <SENTENCE-END> 
    but he which bore my letter friar john
    was stayd by accident and yesternight
    returnd my letter back <SENTENCE-END>  then all alone
    at the prefixed hour of her waking
    came i to take her from her kindreds vault
    meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    till i conveniently could send to romeo <SENTENCE-END> 
    but when i came some minute ere the time  
    of her awaking here untimely lay
    the noble paris and true romeo dead <SENTENCE-END> 
    she wakes and i entreated her come forth
    and bear this work of heaven with patience
    but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
    and she too desperate would not go with me
    but as it seems did violence on herself <SENTENCE-END> 
    all this i know and to the marriage
    her nurse is privy and if aught in this
    miscarried by my fault let my old life
    be sacrificd some hour before his time
    unto the rigour of severest law <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  we still have known thee for a holy man <SENTENCE-END> 
    wheres romeos man what can he say in this
  bal <SENTENCE-END>  i brought my master news of juliets death
    and then in post he came from mantua
    to this same place to this same monument <SENTENCE-END> 
    this letter he early bid me give his father
    and threatned me with death going in the vault
    if i departed not and left him there <SENTENCE-END>   
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  give me the letter <SENTENCE-END>  i will look on it <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is the countys page that raisd the watch
    sirrah what made your master in this place
  boy <SENTENCE-END>  he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
    and bid me stand aloof and so i did <SENTENCE-END> 
    anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
    and byandby my master drew on him
    and then i ran away to call the watch <SENTENCE-END> 
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  this letter doth make good the friars words
    their course of love the tidings of her death
    and here he writes that he did buy a poison
    of a poor pothecary and therewithal
    came to this vault to die and lie with juliet <SENTENCE-END> 
    where be these enemies capulet montage
    see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
    that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
    and i for winking at you discords too
    have lost a brace of kinsmen <SENTENCE-END>  all are punishd <SENTENCE-END> 
  cap <SENTENCE-END>  o brother montague give me thy hand <SENTENCE-END> 
    this is my daughters jointure for no more  
    can i demand <SENTENCE-END> 
  mon <SENTENCE-END>  but i can give thee more
    for i will raise her statue in pure gold
    that whiles verona by that name is known
    there shall no figure at such rate be set
    as that of true and faithful juliet <SENTENCE-END> 
  cap <SENTENCE-END>  as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie
    poor sacrifices of our enmity
  prince <SENTENCE-END>  a glooming peace this morning with it brings <SENTENCE-END> 
    the sun for sorrow will not show his head <SENTENCE-END> 
    go hence to have more talk of these sad things
    some shall be pardond and some punished
    for never was a story of more woe
    than this of juliet and her romeo <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                   exeunt omnes <SENTENCE-END>

    then take him up and manage well the jest
    carry him gently to my fairest chamber

    balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
    and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
    procure me music ready when he wakes
    to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
    and if he chance to speak be ready straight
    and with a low submissive reverence
    say what is it your honour will command
    let one attend him with a silver basin  
    full of rosewater and bestrewd with flowers
    another bear the ewer the third a diaper
    and say willt please your lordship cool your hands
    some one be ready with a costly suit
    and ask him what apparel he will wear
    another tell him of his hounds and horse
    and that his lady mourns at his disease
    persuade him that he hath been lunatic
    and when he says he is say that he dreams
    for he is nothing but a mighty lord <SENTENCE-END>

    it will be pastime passing excellent
    if it be husbanded with modesty <SENTENCE-END>

    was aptly fitted and naturally performd <SENTENCE-END> 
  player <SENTENCE-END>  i think twas soto that your honour means <SENTENCE-END>

    well you are come to me in happy time
    the rather for i have some sport in hand
    wherein your cunning can assist me much <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is a lord will hear you play tonight
    but i am doubtful of your modesties
    lest overeying of his odd behaviour
    for yet his honour never heard a play
    you break into some merry passion
    and so offend him for i tell you sirs
    if you should smile he grows impatient <SENTENCE-END> 
  player <SENTENCE-END>  fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
    were he the veriest antic in the world <SENTENCE-END> 
  lord <SENTENCE-END>  go sirrah take them to the buttery
    and give them friendly welcome every one
    let them want nothing that my house affords <SENTENCE-END> 
                                       exit one with the players  
    sirrah go you to bartholomew my page
    and see him dressd in all suits like a lady
    that done conduct him to the drunkards chamber
    and call him madam do him obeisance <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell him from me as he will win my love
    he bear himself with honourable action
    such as he hath observd in noble ladies
    unto their lords by them accomplished
    such duty to the drunkard let him do
    with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
    and say what ist your honour will command
    wherein your lady and your humble wife
    may show her duty and make known her love
    and then with kind embracements tempting kisses
    and with declining head into his bosom
    bid him shed tears as being overjoyed
    to see her noble lord restord to health
    who for this seven years hath esteemed him
    no better than a poor and loathsome beggar <SENTENCE-END> 
    and if the boy have not a womans gift  
    to rain a shower of commanded tears
    an onion will do well for such a shift
    which in a napkin being close conveyd
    shall in despite enforce a watery eye <SENTENCE-END> 
    see this dispatchd with all the haste thou canst
    anon ill give thee more instructions <SENTENCE-END>      exit a servingman
    i know the boy will well usurp the grace
    voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
    i long to hear him call the drunkard husband
    and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
    when they do homage to this simple peasant <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill in to counsel them haply my presence
    may well abate the overmerry spleen
    which otherwise would grow into extremes <SENTENCE-END>              exeunt

  tranio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray sir tell me is it possible
    that love should of a sudden take such hold
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  o tranio till i found it to be true
    i never thought it possible or likely <SENTENCE-END> 
    but see while idly i stood looking on
    i found the effect of love in idleness
    and now in plainness do confess to thee
    that art to me as secret and as dear
    as anna to the queen of carthage was
    tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio
    if i achieve not this young modest girl <SENTENCE-END> 
    counsel me tranio for i know thou canst  
    assist me tranio for i know thou wilt <SENTENCE-END> 
  tranio <SENTENCE-END>  master it is no time to chide you now

    perhaps you markd not whats the pith of all <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face
    such as the daughter of agenor had
    that made great jove to humble him to her hand
    when with his knees he kissd the cretan strand <SENTENCE-END> 
  tranio <SENTENCE-END>  saw you no more markd you not how her sister
    began to scold and raise up such a storm
    that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  tranio i saw her coral lips to move
    and with her breath she did perfume the air
    sacred and sweet was all i saw in her <SENTENCE-END> 
  tranio <SENTENCE-END>  nay then tis time to stir him from his trance <SENTENCE-END>   
    i pray awake sir <SENTENCE-END>  if you love the maid
    bend thoughts and wits to achieve her <SENTENCE-END>  thus it stands
    her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
    that till the father rid his hands of her
    master your love must live a maid at home
    and therefore has he closely mewd her up
    because she will not be annoyd with suitors <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  ah tranio what a cruel fathers he
    but art thou not advisd he took some care
    to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her

  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  tell me thine first <SENTENCE-END> 
  tranio <SENTENCE-END>  you will be schoolmaster
    and undertake the teaching of the maid
    thats your device <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  it is <SENTENCE-END>  may it be done
  tranio <SENTENCE-END>  not possible for who shall bear your part  
    and be in padua here vincentios son
    keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
    visit his countrymen and banquet them
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  basta content thee for i have it full <SENTENCE-END> 
    we have not yet been seen in any house
    nor can we be distinguishd by our faces
    for man or master <SENTENCE-END>  then it follows thus
    thou shalt be master tranio in my stead
    keep house and port and servants as i should
    i will some other be some florentine
    some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa <SENTENCE-END>

    be serviceable to my son quoth he  
    although i think twas in another sense

    your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio <SENTENCE-END> 
    and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
    blows you to padua here from old verona
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  such wind as scatters young men through the world
    to seek their fortunes farther than at home
    where small experience grows <SENTENCE-END>  but in a few
    signior hortensio thus it stands with me
    antonio my father is deceasd
    and i have thrust myself into this maze
    haply to wive and thrive as best i may
    crowns in my purse i have and goods at home
    and so am come abroad to see the world <SENTENCE-END>   
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
    and wish thee to a shrewd illfavourd wife
    thoudst thank me but a little for my counsel
    and yet ill promise thee she shall be rich
    and very rich but thart too much my friend
    and ill not wish thee to her <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  signior hortensio twixt such friends as we
    few words suffice and therefore if thou know
    one rich enough to be petruchios wife
    as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
    be she as foul as was florentius love
    as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
    as socrates xanthippe or a worse
    she moves me not or not removes at least
    affections edge in me were she as rough
    as are the swelling adriatic seas <SENTENCE-END> 
    i come to wive it wealthily in padua
    if wealthily then happily in padua <SENTENCE-END> 
  grumio <SENTENCE-END>  nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is <SENTENCE-END> 
    why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an  
    agletbaby or an old trot with neer a tooth in her head though
    she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses <SENTENCE-END>  why nothing
    comes amiss so money comes withal <SENTENCE-END> 
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  petruchio since we are steppd thus far in
    i will continue that i broachd in jest <SENTENCE-END> 
    i can petruchio help thee to a wife
    with wealth enough and young and beauteous
    brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
    her only fault and that is faults enough
    is that she is intolerable curst
    and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
    that were my state far worser than it is
    i would not wed her for a mine of gold <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  hortensio peace thou knowst not golds effect <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell me her fathers name and tis enough
    for i will board her though she chide as loud
    as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack <SENTENCE-END> 
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  her father is baptista minola
    an affable and courteous gentleman
    her name is katherina minola  
    renownd in padua for her scolding tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  i know her father though i know not her
    and he knew my deceased father well <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will not sleep hortensio till i see her
    and therefore let me be thus bold with you
    to give you over at this first encounter
    unless you will accompany me thither <SENTENCE-END> 
  grumio <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts <SENTENCE-END>  o my
    word and she knew him as well as i do she would think scolding
    would do little good upon him <SENTENCE-END>  she may perhaps call him half a
    score knaves or so <SENTENCE-END>  why thats nothing and he begin once hell
    rail in his ropetricks <SENTENCE-END>  ill tell you what sir an she stand
    him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so
    disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
    withal than a cat <SENTENCE-END>  you know him not sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  tarry petruchio i must go with thee
    for in baptistas keep my treasure is <SENTENCE-END> 
    he hath the jewel of my life in hold
    his youngest daughter beautiful bianca
    and her withholds from me and other more  
    suitors to her and rivals in my love
    supposing it a thing impossible
    for those defects i have before rehearsd
    that ever katherina will be wood <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore this order hath baptista taen
    that none shall have access unto bianca
    till katherine the curst have got a husband <SENTENCE-END> 
  grumio <SENTENCE-END>  katherine the curst
    a title for a maid of all titles the worst <SENTENCE-END> 
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  now shall my friend petruchio do me grace
    and offer me disguisd in sober robes
    to old baptista as a schoolmaster
    well seen in music to instruct bianca
    that so i may by this device at least
    have leave and leisure to make love to her
    and unsuspected court her by herself <SENTENCE-END>

    that is her love for that is all in all <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  why that is nothing for i tell you father
    i am as peremptory as she proudminded
    and where two raging fires meet together
    they do consume the thing that feeds their fury <SENTENCE-END> 
    though little fire grows great with little wind
    yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all <SENTENCE-END> 
    so i to her and so she yields to me
    for i am rough and woo not like a babe <SENTENCE-END> 
  baptista <SENTENCE-END>  well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
    but be thou armd for some unhappy words <SENTENCE-END>

  baptista <SENTENCE-END>  why then thou canst not break her to the lute
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  why no for she hath broke the lute to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    i did but tell her she mistook her frets
    and bowd her hand to teach her fingering
    when with a most impatient devilish spirit
    frets call you these quoth she ill fume with them <SENTENCE-END> 
    and with that word she struck me on the head
    and through the instrument my pate made way
    and there i stood amazed for a while
    as on a pillory looking through the lute  
    while she did call me rascal fiddler
    and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms
    as she had studied to misuse me so <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  now by the world it is a lusty wench
    i love her ten times more than eer i did <SENTENCE-END>

    then ill commend her volubility  
    and say she uttereth piercing eloquence <SENTENCE-END> 
    if she do bid me pack ill give her thanks

    she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
    last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
    as with the meat some undeserved fault

    this way the coverlet another way the sheets
    ay and amid this hurly i intend
    that all is done in reverend care of her
    and in conclusion she shall watch all night
    and if she chance to nod ill rail and brawl  
    and with the clamour keep her still awake <SENTENCE-END> 
    this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
    and thus ill curb her mad and headstrong humour <SENTENCE-END>

                                            katherina complies
  widow <SENTENCE-END>  lord let me never have a cause to sigh
    till i be brought to such a silly pass
  bianca <SENTENCE-END>  fie what a foolish duty call you this
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  i would your duty were as foolish too  
    the wisdom of your duty fair bianca
    hath cost me a hundred crowns since suppertime
  bianca <SENTENCE-END>  the more fool you for laying on my duty <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  katherine i charge thee tell these headstrong women
    what duty they do owe their lords and husbands <SENTENCE-END> 
  widow <SENTENCE-END>  come come youre mocking we will have no telling <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  come on i say and first begin with her <SENTENCE-END> 
  widow <SENTENCE-END>  she shall not <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  i say she shall <SENTENCE-END>  and first begin with her <SENTENCE-END> 
  katherina <SENTENCE-END>  fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
    and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
    to wound thy lord thy king thy governor <SENTENCE-END> 
    it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
    confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
    and in no sense is meet or amiable <SENTENCE-END> 
    a woman movd is like a fountain troubled
    muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty
    and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
    will deign to sip or touch one drop of it <SENTENCE-END> 
    thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper  
    thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
    and for thy maintenance commits his body
    to painful labour both by sea and land
    to watch the night in storms the day in cold
    whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
    and craves no other tribute at thy hands
    but love fair looks and true obedience
    too little payment for so great a debt <SENTENCE-END> 
    such duty as the subject owes the prince
    even such a woman oweth to her husband
    and when she is froward peevish sullen sour
    and not obedient to his honest will
    what is she but a foul contending rebel
    and graceless traitor to her loving lord
    i am ashamd that women are so simple
    to offer war where they should kneel for peace
    or seek for rule supremacy and sway
    when they are bound to serve love and obey <SENTENCE-END> 
    why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
    unapt to toll and trouble in the world  
    but that our soft conditions and our hearts
    should well agree with our external parts
    come come you froward and unable worins
    my mind hath been as big as one of yours
    my heart as great my reason haply more
    to bandy word for word and frown for frown
    but now i see our lances are but straws
    our strength as weak our weakness past compare
    that seeming to be most which we indeed least are <SENTENCE-END> 
    then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
    and place your hands below your husbands foot
    in token of which duty if he please
    my hand is ready may it do him ease <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  why theres a wench come on and kiss me kate <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat <SENTENCE-END> 
  vincentio <SENTENCE-END>  tis a good hearing when children are toward <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  but a harsh hearing when women are froward <SENTENCE-END> 
  petruchio <SENTENCE-END>  come kate well to bed <SENTENCE-END> 
    we three are married but you two are sped <SENTENCE-END> 
    to lucentio  twas i won the wager though you hit the white  
    and being a winner god give you good night
                                  exeunt petruchio and katherina
  hortensio <SENTENCE-END>  now go thy ways thou hast tamd a curst shrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucentio <SENTENCE-END>  tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamd so <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                          exeunt

scene 2

the island <SENTENCE-END>  before prosperos cell

enter prospero and miranda

  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  if by your art my dearest father you have
    put the wild waters in this roar allay them <SENTENCE-END> 
    the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
    but that the sea mounting to th welkins cheek
    dashes the fire out <SENTENCE-END>  o i have suffered
    with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel
    who had no doubt some noble creature in her
    dashd all to pieces o the cry did knock
    against my very heart poor souls they perishd <SENTENCE-END> 
    had i been any god of power i would
    have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
    it should the good ship so have swallowd and
    the fraughting souls within her <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  be conected
    no more amazement tell your piteous heart
    theres no harm done <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  o woe the day  
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  no harm <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have done nothing but in care of thee
    of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
    art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
    of whence i am nor that i am more better
    than prospero master of a full poor cell
    and thy no greater father <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  more to know
    did never meddle with my thoughts <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  tis time
    i should inform thee farther <SENTENCE-END>  lend thy hand
    and pluck my magic garment from me <SENTENCE-END>  so
                                          lays down his mantle
    lie there my art <SENTENCE-END>  wipe thou thine eyes have comfort <SENTENCE-END> 
    the direful spectacle of the wreck which touchd
    the very virtue of compassion in thee
    i have with such provision in mine art
    so safely ordered that there is no soul
    no not so much perdition as an hair
    betid to any creature in the vessel  
    which thou heardst cry which thou sawst sink <SENTENCE-END> 
    sit down for thou must now know farther <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  you have often
    begun to tell me what i am but stoppd
    and left me to a bootless inquisition
    concluding stay not yet <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  the hours now come
    the very minute bids thee ope thine ear <SENTENCE-END> 
    obey and be attentive <SENTENCE-END>  canst thou remember
    a time before we came unto this cell
    i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
    out three years old <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  certainly sir i can <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  by what by any other house or person
    of any thing the image tell me that
    hath kept with thy remembrance
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  tis far off
    and rather like a dream than an assurance
    that my remembrance warrants <SENTENCE-END>  had i not
    four or five women once that tended me  
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  thou hadst and more miranda <SENTENCE-END>  but how is it
    that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else
    in the dark backward and abysm of time
    if thou remembrest aught ere thou camst here

    which is from my remembrance <SENTENCE-END>  please you farther <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  my brother and thy uncle calld antonio
    i pray thee mark me that a brother should
    be so perfidious <SENTENCE-END>  he whom next thyself
    of all the world i lovd and to him put
    the manage of my state as at that time
    through all the signories it was the first
    and prospero the prime duke being so reputed
    in dignity and for the liberal arts
    without a parallel those being all my study
    the government i cast upon my brother
    and to my state grew stranger being transported
    and rapt in secret studies <SENTENCE-END>  thy false uncle
    dost thou attend me
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  sir most heedfully <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  being once perfected how to grant suits

    to closeness and the bettering of my mind
    with that which but by being so retird
    oerprizd all popular rate in my false brother
    awakd an evil nature and my trust
    like a good parent did beget of him
    a falsehood in its contrary as great
    as my trust was which had indeed no limit
    a confidence sans bound <SENTENCE-END>  he being thus lorded
    not only with what my revenue yielded
    but what my power might else exact like one
    who having into truth by telling of it  
    made such a sinner of his memory
    to credit his own liehe did believe
    he was indeed the duke out o th substitution
    and executing th outward face of royalty
    with all prerogative <SENTENCE-END>  hence his ambition growing
    dost thou hear
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  your tale sir would cure deafness <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  to have no screen between this part he playd
    and him he playd it for he needs will be
    absolute milan <SENTENCE-END>  me poor manmy library
    was dukedom large enoughof temporal royalties
    he thinks me now incapable confederates
    so dry he was for sway wi th king of naples
    to give him annual tribute do him homage
    subject his coronet to his crown and bend
    the dukedom yet unbowdalas poor milan
    to most ignoble stooping <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  o the heavens

  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  i should sin
    to think but nobly of my grandmother
    good wombs have borne bad sons <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  now the condition
    this king of naples being an enemy
    to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit
    which was that he in lieu o th premises
    of homage and i know not how much tribute
    should presently extirpate me and mine
    out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
    with all the honours on my brother <SENTENCE-END>  whereon
    a treacherous army levied one midnight
    fated to th purpose did antonio open
    the gates of milan and i th dead of darkness
    the ministers for th purpose hurried thence
    me and thy crying self <SENTENCE-END>

    a mark so bloody on the business but
    with colours fairer painted their foul ends <SENTENCE-END> 
    in few they hurried us aboard a bark
    bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
    a rotten carcass of a butt not riggd
    nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
    instinctively have quit it <SENTENCE-END>  there they hoist us
    to cry to th sea that roard to us to sigh
    to th winds whose pity sighing back again
    did us but loving wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  alack what trouble

  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  the visitor will not give him oer so <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  look hes winding up the watch of his wit by
    and by it will strike <SENTENCE-END>

  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  when every grief is entertaind thats offerd

  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  a dollar <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken
    truer than you purposd <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  you have taken it wiselier than i meant you

  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  therefore my lord
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  i prithee spare <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  well i have done but yet
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  he will be talking <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  which of he or adrian for a good wager first
    begins to crow
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  the old cock <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  the cockrel <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  done <SENTENCE-END>  the wager
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  a laughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  a match
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  though this island seem to be desert  
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  ha ha ha
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  so youre paid <SENTENCE-END> 
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  yet
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  yet
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  he could not misst <SENTENCE-END> 
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
    temperance <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  temperance was a delicate wench <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  ay and a subtle as he most learnedly
    deliverd <SENTENCE-END> 
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  the air breathes upon us here most sweetly <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  as if it had lungs and rotten ones <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  or as twere perfumd by a fen <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  here is everything advantageous to life <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  true save means to live <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  of that theres none or little <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  the ground indeed is tawny <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  with an eye of green int <SENTENCE-END>   
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  he misses not much <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  no he doth but mistake the truth totally <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost
    beyond credit
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  as many vouchd rarities are <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  that our garments being as they were drenchd
    in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
    glosses being rather newdyd than staind with salt
    water <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  if but one of his pockets could speak would it
    not say he lies
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  ay or very falsely pocket up his report <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
    we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the
    kings fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in
    our return <SENTENCE-END> 
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  tunis was never gracd before with such a paragon
    to their queen <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  not since widow didos time <SENTENCE-END>   
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  widow a pox o that how came that widow
    in widow dido
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  what if he had said widower aeneas too
    good lord how you take it
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  widow dido said you you make me study of
    that <SENTENCE-END>  she was of carthage not of tunis <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  this tunis sir was carthage <SENTENCE-END> 
  adrian <SENTENCE-END>  carthage
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  i assure you carthage <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  his word is more than the miraculous harp <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  he hath raisd the wall and houses too <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  what impossible matter will he make easy next
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  i think he will carry this island home in his
    pocket and give it his son for an apple <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
    forth more islands <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  ay <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  why in good time <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  sir we were talking that our garments seem now
    as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of  
    your daughter who is now queen <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  and the rarest that eer came there <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  bate i beseech you widow dido <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  o widow dido ay widow dido <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i
    wore it i mean in a sort <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  that sort was well fishd for <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  when i wore it at your daughters marriage
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  you cram these words into mine ears against
    the stomach of my sense <SENTENCE-END>  would i had never
    married my daughter there for coming thence
    my son is lost and in my rate she too
    who is so far from italy removed
    i neer again shall see her <SENTENCE-END>  o thou mine heir
    of naples and of milan what strange fish
    hath made his meal on thee
  francisco <SENTENCE-END>  sir he may live
    i saw him beat the surges under him
    and ride upon their backs he trod the water
    whose enmity he flung aside and breasted  
    the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
    bove the contentious waves he kept and oared
    himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
    to th shore that oer his waveworn basis bowed
    as stooping to relieve him <SENTENCE-END>  i not doubt
    he came alive to land <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  no no hes gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
    that would not bless our europe with your daughter
    but rather lose her to an african
    where she at least is banishd from your eye
    who hath cause to wet the grief ont <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  prithee peace <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  you were kneeld to and importund otherwise
    by all of us and the fair soul herself
    weighd between loathness and obedience at
    which end o th beam should bow <SENTENCE-END>  we have lost your son
    i fear for ever <SENTENCE-END>  milan and naples have
    moe widows in them of this business making
    than we bring men to comfort them  
    the faults your own <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  so is the dearst o th loss <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  my lord sebastian
    the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
    and time to speak it in you rub the sore
    when you should bring the plaster <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  very well <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  and most chirurgeonly <SENTENCE-END>

  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  and were the king ont what would i do
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  scape being drunk for want of wine <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  i th commonwealth i would by contraries

    and use of service none contract succession
    bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
    no use of metal corn or wine or oil
    no occupation all men idle all
    and women too but innocent and pure
    no sovereignty
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  yet he would be king ont <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
    beginning <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  all things in common nature should produce
    without sweat or endeavour <SENTENCE-END>  treason felony
    sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
    would i not have but nature should bring forth
    of it own kind all foison all abundance
    to feed my innocent people <SENTENCE-END>

    they are inclind to do so <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  please you sir

    will guard your person while you take your rest
    and watch your safety <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  thank youwondrous heavy

  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  what a strange drowsiness possesses them
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  it is the quality o th climate <SENTENCE-END>   
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  why
    doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not
    myself disposd to sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  nor i my spirits are nimble <SENTENCE-END> 
    they fell together all as by consent
    they droppd as by a thunderstroke <SENTENCE-END>  what might
    worthy sebastian o what might no more
    and yet methinks i see it in thy face
    what thou shouldst be th occasion speaks thee and
    my strong imagination sees a crown
    dropping upon thy head <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  what art thou waking
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  do you not hear me speak
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  i do and surely
    it is a sleepy language and thou speakst
    out of thy sleep <SENTENCE-END>  what is it thou didst say
    this is a strange repose to be asleep
    with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
    and yet so fast asleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  noble sebastian  
    thou letst thy fortune sleepdie rather winkst
    whiles thou art waking <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost snore distinctly
    theres meaning in thy snores <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i am more serious than my custom you
    must be so too if heed me which to do
    trebles thee oer <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  well i am standing water <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  ill teach you how to flow <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  do so to ebb
    hereditary sloth instructs me <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  o
    if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
    whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
    you more invest it ebbing men indeed
    most often do so near the bottom run
    by their own fear or sloth <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  prithee say on <SENTENCE-END> 
    the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
    a matter from thee and a birth indeed  
    which throes thee much to yield <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  thus sir
    although this lord of weak remembrance this
    who shall be of as little memory
    when he is earthd hath here almost persuaded
    for hes a spirit of persuasion only
    professes to persuadethe king his sons alive
    tis as impossible that hes undrownd
    as he that sleeps here swims <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  i have no hope
    that hes undrownd <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  o out of that no hope
    what great hope have you no hope that way is
    another way so high a hope that even
    ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
    but doubt discovery there <SENTENCE-END>  will you grant with me
    that ferdinand is drownd
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  hes gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  then tell me
    whos the next heir of naples  
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  claribel <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  she that is queen of tunis she that dwells
    ten leagues beyond mans life she that from naples
    can have no note unless the sun were post
    the man i th moons too slow till newborn chins
    be rough and razorable she that from whom
    we all were seaswallowd though some cast again

    tis true my brothers daughters queen of tunis
    so is she heir of naples twixt which regions
    there is some space <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  a space whose evry cubit
    seems to cry out how shall that claribel
    measure us back to naples keep in tunis
    and let sebastian wake <SENTENCE-END>  say this were death
    that now hath seizd them why they were no worse
    than now they are <SENTENCE-END>  there be that can rule naples  
    as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
    as amply and unnecessarily
    as this gonzalo i myself could make
    a chough of as deep chat <SENTENCE-END>  o that you bore
    the mind that i do what a sleep were this
    for your advancement do you understand me
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  methinks i do <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  and how does your content
    tender your own good fortune
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  i remember
    you did supplant your brother prospero <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  true <SENTENCE-END> 
    and look how well my garments sit upon me
    much feater than before <SENTENCE-END>  my brothers servants
    were then my fellows now they are my men <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  but for your conscience

    twould put me to my slipper but i feel not
    this deity in my bosom twenty consciences
    that stand twixt me and milan candied be they  
    and melt ere they molest here lies your brother
    no better than the earth he lies upon
    if he were that which now hes likethats dead
    whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it
    can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
    to the perpetual wink for aye might put
    this ancient morsel this sir prudence who
    should not upbraid our course <SENTENCE-END>  for all the rest
    theyll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
    theyll tell the clock to any business that

  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  there be some sports are painful and their
    labour
    delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
    are nobly undergone and most poor matters
    point to rich ends <SENTENCE-END>  this my mean task
    would be as heavy to me as odious but
    the mistress which i serve quickens whats dead
    and makes my labours pleasures <SENTENCE-END>  o she is
    ten times more gentle than her fathers crabbed
    and hes composd of harshness <SENTENCE-END>  i must remove
    some thousands of these logs and pile them up
    upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
    weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
    had never like executor <SENTENCE-END>  i forget
    but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
    most busy least when i do it <SENTENCE-END> 
  
        enter miranda and prospero at a distance unseen

  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  alas now pray you
    work not so hard i would the lightning had
    burnt up those logs that you are enjoind to pile <SENTENCE-END> 
    pray set it down and rest you when this burns
    twill weep for having wearied you <SENTENCE-END>  my father
    is hard at study pray now rest yourself
    hes safe for these three hours <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  o most dear mistress
    the sun will set before i shall discharge
    what i must strive to do <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  if youll sit down
    ill bear your logs the while pray give me that
    ill carry it to the pile <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  no precious creature
    i had rather crack my sinews break my back
    than you should such dishonour undergo
    while i sit lazy by <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  it would become me  
    as well as it does you and i should do it
    with much more ease for my good will is to it
    and yours it is against <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>   aside  poor worm thou art infected
    this visitation shows it <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  you look wearily <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  no noble mistress tis fresh morning with me
    when you are by at night <SENTENCE-END>  i do beseech you
    chiefly that i might set it in my prayers
    what is your name
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  mirandao my father
    i have broke your hest to say so
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  admird miranda
    whats dearest to the world full many a lady
    i have eyd with best regard and many a time
    th harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
    brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
    have i likd several women never any
    with so full soul but some defect in her
    did quarrel with the noblest grace she owd  
    and put it to the foil but you o you
    so perfect and so peerless are created
    of every creatures best
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  i do not know
    one of my sex no womans face remember
    save from my glass mine own nor have i seen
    more that i may call men than you good friend
    and my dear father <SENTENCE-END>  how features are abroad
    i am skilless of but by my modesty
    the jewel in my dower i would not wish
    any companion in the world but you
    nor can imagination form a shape
    besides yourself to like of <SENTENCE-END>  but i prattle
    something too wildly and my fathers precepts
    i therein do forget <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  i am in my condition
    a prince miranda i do think a king
    i would not soand would no more endure
    this wooden slavery than to suffer
    the fleshfly blow my mouth <SENTENCE-END>  hear my soul speak  
    the very instant that i saw you did
    my heart fly to your service there resides
    to make me slave to it and for your sake
    am i this patient logman <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  do you love me
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound
    and crown what i profess with kind event
    if i speak true if hollowly invert
    what best is boded me to mischief i
    beyond all limit of what else i th world
    do love prize honour you <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  i am a fool
    to weep at what i am glad of <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>   aside  fair encounter
    of two most rare affections heavens rain grace
    on that which breeds between em
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  wherefore weep you
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
    what i desire to give and much less take
    what i shall die to want <SENTENCE-END>  but this is trifling  
    and all the more it seeks to hide itself
    the bigger bulk it shows <SENTENCE-END>  hence bashful cunning
    and prompt me plain and holy innocence
    i am your wife if you will marry me
    if not ill die your maid <SENTENCE-END>  to be your fellow
    you may deny me but ill be your servant
    whether you will or no <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  my mistress dearest
    and i thus humble ever <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  my husband then
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  ay with a heart as willing
    as bondage eer of freedom <SENTENCE-END>  heres my hand <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  and mine with my heart int <SENTENCE-END>  and now farewell
    till half an hour hence <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  a thousand thousand
                          exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  so glad of this as they i cannot be
    who are surprisd withal but my rejoicing
    at nothing can be more <SENTENCE-END>  ill to my book
    for yet ere supper time must i perform  
    much business appertaining <SENTENCE-END>                              exit

    will we take throughly <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>   aside to sebastian  let it be tonight
    for now they are oppressd with travel they
    will not nor cannot use such vigilance
    as when they are fresh <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>   aside to antonio  i say tonight no more <SENTENCE-END> 

           solemn and strange music and prospero on the
           top invisible <SENTENCE-END>  enter several strange shapes
           bringing in a banquet and dance about it with
           gentle actions of salutations and inviting the
           king etc <SENTENCE-END>  to eat they depart

  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  ill believe both

  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  if in naples
    i should report this now would they believe me
    if i should say i saw such islanders
    for certes these are people of the island
    who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
    their manners are more gentlekind than of
    our human generation you shall find
    many nay almost any <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>   aside  honest lord
    thou hast said well for some of you there present
    are worse than devils <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot too much muse
    such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
    although they want the use of tongue a kind
    of excellent dumb discourse <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>   aside  praise in departing <SENTENCE-END>   
  francisco <SENTENCE-END>  they vanishd strangely <SENTENCE-END>

    willt please you taste of what is here
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  not i <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  faith sir you need not fear <SENTENCE-END>  when we were boys
    who would believe that there were mountaineers
    dewlappd like bulls whose throats had hanging at em
    wallets of flesh or that there were such men
    whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
    each putterout of five for one will bring us
    good warrant of <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  i will stand to and feed
    although my last no matter since i feel
    the best is past <SENTENCE-END>  brother my lord the duke

       thunder and lightning <SENTENCE-END>  enter ariel like a harpy
       claps his wings upon the table and with a quaint
                device the banquet vanishes  

  ariel <SENTENCE-END>  you are three men of sin whom destiny
    that hath to instrument this lower world
    and what is int the neversurfeited sea
    hath causd to belch up you and on this island
    where man doth not inhabityou mongst men
    being most unfit to live <SENTENCE-END>  i have made you mad
    and even with suchlike valour men hang and drown
    their proper selves <SENTENCE-END> 
                     alonso sebastian etc <SENTENCE-END>  draw their swords
    you fools i and my fellows
    are ministers of fate the elements
    of whom your swords are temperd may as well
    wound the loud winds or with bemockdat stabs
    kill the stillclosing waters as diminish
    one dowle thats in my plume my fellowministers
    are like invulnerable <SENTENCE-END>  if you could hurt
    your swords are now too massy for your strengths
    and will not be uplifted <SENTENCE-END>  but remember
    for thats my business to youthat you three  
    from milan did supplant good prospero
    exposd unto the sea which hath requit it
    him and his innocent child for which foul deed
    the powrs delaying not forgetting have
    incensd the seas and shores yea all the creatures
    against your peace <SENTENCE-END>  thee of thy son alonso
    they have bereft and do pronounce by me
    lingring perdition worse than any death
    can be at once shall step by step attend
    you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from
    which here in this most desolate isle else falls
    upon your headsis nothing but hearts sorrow
    and a clear life ensuing <SENTENCE-END> 

        he vanishes in thunder then to soft music enter
        the shapes again and dance with mocks and mows
                and carrying out the table

  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
    performd my ariel a grace it had devouring <SENTENCE-END>   
    of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
    in what thou hadst to say so with good life
    and observation strange my meaner ministers
    their several kinds have done <SENTENCE-END>  my high charms work
    and these mine enemies are all knit up
    in their distractions <SENTENCE-END>  they now are in my powr
    and in these fits i leave them while i visit

    the winds did sing it to me and the thunder
    that deep and dreadful organpipe pronouncd
    the name of prosper it did bass my trespass <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore my son i th ooze is bedded and
    ill seek him deeper than eer plummet sounded
    and with him there lie mudded <SENTENCE-END>                           exit

before prosperos cell

enter prospero in his magic robes and ariel

  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  now does my project gather to a head
    my charms crack not my spirits obey and time
    goes upright with his carriage <SENTENCE-END>  hows the day
  ariel <SENTENCE-END>  on the sixth hour at which time my lord
    you said our work should cease <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  i did say so
    when first i raisd the tempest <SENTENCE-END>  say my spirit
    how fares the king and s followers
  ariel <SENTENCE-END>  confind together
    in the same fashion as you gave in charge
    just as you left them all prisoners sir
    in the linegrove which weatherfends your cell
    they cannot budge till your release <SENTENCE-END>  the king
    his brother and yours abide all three distracted
    and the remainder mourning over them
    brim full of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
    him you termd sir the good old lord gonzalo  
    his tears run down his beard like winters drops
    from eaves of reeds <SENTENCE-END>  your charm so strongly works em
    that if you now beheld them your affections
    would become tender <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou think so spirit
  ariel <SENTENCE-END>  mine would sir were i human <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  and mine shall <SENTENCE-END> 
    hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
    of their afflictions and shall not myself
    one of their kind that relish all as sharply
    passion as they be kindlier movd than thou art
    though with their high wrongs i am struck to th quick
    yet with my nobler reason gainst my fury
    do i take part the rarer action is
    in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
    the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
    not a frown further <SENTENCE-END>  go release them ariel
    my charms ill break their senses ill restore
    and they shall be themselves <SENTENCE-END> 
  ariel <SENTENCE-END>  ill fetch them sir <SENTENCE-END>                               exit  
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and
    groves
    and ye that on the sands with printless foot
    do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him
    when he comes back you demipuppets that
    by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
    whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
    is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
    to hear the solemn curfew by whose aid
    weak masters though ye bei have bedimmd
    the noontide sun calld forth the mutinous winds
    and twixt the green sea and the azurd vault
    set roaring war <SENTENCE-END>  to the dread rattling thunder
    have i given fire and rifted joves stout oak
    with his own bolt the strongbasd promontory
    have i made shake and by the spurs pluckd up
    the pine and cedar <SENTENCE-END>  graves at my command
    have wakd their sleepers opd and let em forth
    by my so potent art <SENTENCE-END>  but this rough magic
    i here abjure and when i have requird  
    some heavenly musicwhich even now i do
    to work mine end upon their senses that
    this airy charm is for ill break my staff
    bury it certain fathoms in the earth
    and deeper than did ever plummet sound
    ill drown my book <SENTENCE-END>                             solem music

            here enters ariel before then alonso with
          frantic gesture attended by gonzalo sebastian
           and antonio in like manner attended by adrian
           and francisco <SENTENCE-END>  they all enter the circle which
          prospero had made and there stand charmd which
                    prospero observing speaks

    a solemn air and the best comforter
    to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
    now useless boild within thy skull there stand
    for you are spellstoppd <SENTENCE-END> 
    holy gonzalo honourable man
    mine eyes evn sociable to the show of thine  
    fall fellowly drops <SENTENCE-END>  the charm dissolves apace
    and as the morning steals upon the night
    melting the darkness so their rising senses
    begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    their clearer reason <SENTENCE-END>  o good gonzalo
    my true preserver and a loyal sir
    to him thou followst i will pay thy graces
    home both in word and deed <SENTENCE-END>  most cruelly
    didst thou alonso use me and my daughter
    thy brother was a furtherer in the act <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou art pinchd fort now sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  flesh and blood
    you brother mine that entertaind ambition
    expelld remorse and nature who with sebastian
    whose inward pinches therefore are most strong
    would here have killd your king i do forgive thee
    unnatural though thou art <SENTENCE-END>  their understanding
    begins to swell and the approaching tide
    will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    that now lies foul and muddy <SENTENCE-END>  not one of them
    that yet looks on me or would know me <SENTENCE-END>  ariel  
    fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell           exit ariel
    i will discase me and myself present
    as i was sometime milan <SENTENCE-END>  quickly spirit
    thou shalt ere long be free <SENTENCE-END> 

        ariel on returning sings and helps to attire him

    where the bee sucks there suck i
    in a cowslips bell i lie
    there i couch when owls do cry <SENTENCE-END> 
    on the bats back i do fly
    after summer merrily <SENTENCE-END> 
    merrily merrily shall i live now
    under the blossom that hangs on the bough <SENTENCE-END> 

  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  why thats my dainty ariel i shall miss thee
    but yet thou shalt have freedom <SENTENCE-END>  so so so <SENTENCE-END> 
    to the kings ship invisible as thou art
    there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
    under the hatches the master and the boatswain  
    being awake enforce them to this place
    and presently i prithee <SENTENCE-END> 
  ariel <SENTENCE-END>  i drink the air before me and return
    or ere your pulse twice beat <SENTENCE-END>                            exit
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  all torment trouble wonder and amazement
    inhabits here <SENTENCE-END>  some heavenly power guide us
    out of this fearful country

    for more assurance that a living prince
    does now speak to thee i embrace thy body
    and to thee and thy company i bid
    a hearty welcome <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  wheer thou best he or no
    or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
    as late i have been i not know <SENTENCE-END>  thy pulse
    beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee
    th affliction of my mind amends with which
    i fear a madness held me <SENTENCE-END>  this must crave
    an if this be at alla most strange story <SENTENCE-END>   
    thy dukedom i resign and do entreat
    thou pardon me my wrongs <SENTENCE-END>  but how should prospero
    be living and be here
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  first noble friend
    let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
    be measurd or confind <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  whether this be
    or be not ill not swear <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  you do yet taste
    some subtleties o th isle that will not let you
    believe things certain <SENTENCE-END>  welcome my friends all
    aside to sebastian and antonio  but you my brace of
      lords were i so minded
    i here could pluck his highness frown upon you
    and justify you traitors at this time
    i will tell no tales <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>   aside  the devil speaks in him <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END> 
    for you most wicked sir whom to call brother
    would even infect my mouth i do forgive  
    thy rankest faultall of them and require
    my dukedom of thee which perforce i know
    thou must restore <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  if thou beest prospero
    give us particulars of thy preservation
    how thou hast met us here whom three hours since
    were wreckd upon this shore where i have lost
    how sharp the point of this remembrance is
    my dear son ferdinand <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  i am woe fort sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  irreparable is the loss and patience
    says it is past her cure <SENTENCE-END> 
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  i rather think
    you have not sought her help of whose soft grace
    for the like loss i have her sovereign aid
    and rest myself content <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  you the like loss
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  as great to me as late and supportable
    to make the dear loss have i means much weaker
    than you may call to comfort you for i  
    have lost my daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  a daughter
    o heavens that they were living both in naples
    the king and queen there that they were i wish
    myself were mudded in that oozy bed
    where my son lies <SENTENCE-END>  when did you lose your daughter
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  in this last tempest <SENTENCE-END>  i perceive these lords
    at this encounter do so much admire
    that they devour their reason and scarce think
    their eyes do offices of truth their words
    are natural breath but howsoeer you have
    been justled from your senses know for certain
    that i am prospero and that very duke
    which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely
    upon this shore where you were wrecked was landed
    to be the lord ont <SENTENCE-END>  no more yet of this
    for tis a chronicle of day by day
    not a relation for a breakfast nor
    befitting this first meeting <SENTENCE-END>  welcome sir
    this cells my court here have i few attendants  
    and subjects none abroad pray you look in <SENTENCE-END> 
    my dukedom since you have given me again
    i will requite you with as good a thing
    at least bring forth a wonder to content ye
    as much as me my dukedom <SENTENCE-END> 

          here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda
                      playing at chess

  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  sweet lord you play me false <SENTENCE-END> 
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  no my dearest love
    i would not for the world <SENTENCE-END> 
  miranda <SENTENCE-END>  yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
    and i would call it fair play <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  if this prove
    a vision of the island one dear son
    shall i twice lose <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  a most high miracle
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  though the seas threaten they are merciful
    i have cursd them without cause <SENTENCE-END>                    kneels  
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  now all the blessings
    of a glad father compass thee about
    arise and say how thou camst here <SENTENCE-END>

    how many goodly creatures are there here
    how beauteous mankind is o brave new world
    that has such people int
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  tis new to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
    your eldst acquaintance cannot be three hours
    is she the goddess that hath severd us
    and brought us thus together
  ferdinand <SENTENCE-END>  sir she is mortal
    but by immortal providence shes mine <SENTENCE-END> 
    i chose her when i could not ask my father
    for his advice nor thought i had one <SENTENCE-END>  she
    is daughter to this famous duke of milan
    of whom so often i have heard renown
    but never saw before of whom i have
    receivd a second life and second father  
    this lady makes him to me <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  i am hers <SENTENCE-END> 
    but o how oddly will it sound that i
    must ask my child forgiveness
  prospero <SENTENCE-END>  there sir stop
    let us not burden our remembrances with
    a heaviness thats gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  i have inly wept
    or should have spoke ere this <SENTENCE-END>  look down you gods
    and on this couple drop a blessed crown
    for it is you that have chalkd forth the way
    which brought us hither <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>  i say amen gonzalo
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  was milan thrust from milan that his issue
    should become kings of naples o rejoice
    beyond a common joy and set it down
    with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage
    did claribel her husband find at tunis
    and ferdinand her brother found a wife
    where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom  
    in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
    when no man was his own <SENTENCE-END> 
  alonso <SENTENCE-END>   to ferdinand and miranda  give me your
    hands <SENTENCE-END> 
    let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
    that doth not wish you joy <SENTENCE-END> 
  gonzalo <SENTENCE-END>  be it so <SENTENCE-END>  amen

          must fill or else my project fails
          which was to please <SENTENCE-END>  now i want
          spirits to enforce art to enchant
          and my ending is despair
          unless i be relievd by prayer
          which pierces so that it assaults
          mercy itself and frees all faults <SENTENCE-END> 
          as you from crimes would pardond be  
          let your indulgence set me free <SENTENCE-END>

  merchant <SENTENCE-END>  o pray lets seet <SENTENCE-END>  for the lord timon sir
  jeweller <SENTENCE-END>  if he will touch the estimate <SENTENCE-END>  but for that
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  when we for recompense have praisd the vile
    it stains the glory in that happy verse
    which aptly sings the good <SENTENCE-END> 
  merchant <SENTENCE-END>  looking at the jewel tis a good form <SENTENCE-END> 
  jeweller <SENTENCE-END>  and rich <SENTENCE-END>  here is a water look ye <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  you are rapt sir in some work some dedication
    to the great lord <SENTENCE-END>

    our poesy is as a gum which oozes
    from whence tis nourishd <SENTENCE-END>  the fire i th flint
    shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
    provokes itself and like the current flies
    each bound it chafes <SENTENCE-END>  what have you there

  painter <SENTENCE-END>  tis a good piece <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  so tis this comes off well and excellent <SENTENCE-END>   
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  indifferent <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  admirable <SENTENCE-END>  how this grace
    speaks his own standing what a mental power
    this eye shoots forth how big imagination
    moves in this lip to th dumbness of the gesture
    one might interpret <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  it is a pretty mocking of the life <SENTENCE-END> 
    here is a touch ist good
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  i will say of it
    it tutors nature <SENTENCE-END>  artificial strife
    lives in these touches livelier than life <SENTENCE-END> 

              enter certain senators and pass over

  painter <SENTENCE-END>  how this lord is followed
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  the senators of athens happy man
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  look moe

    i have in this rough work shapd out a man
    whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug  
    with amplest entertainment <SENTENCE-END>  my free drift
    halts not particularly but moves itself
    in a wide sea of tax <SENTENCE-END>  no levelld malice
    infects one comma in the course i hold
    but flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
    leaving no tract behind <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  how shall i understand you
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  i will unbolt to you <SENTENCE-END> 
    you see how all conditions how all minds
    as well of glib and slippry creatures as
    of grave and austere quality tender down
    their services to lord timon <SENTENCE-END>  his large fortune
    upon his good and gracious nature hanging
    subdues and properties to his love and tendance
    all sorts of hearts yea from the glassfacd flatterer
    to apemantus that few things loves better
    than to abhor himself even he drops down
    the knee before him and returns in peace
    most rich in timons nod <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  i saw them speak together <SENTENCE-END>   
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  sir i have upon a high and pleasant hill
    feignd fortune to be thrond <SENTENCE-END>  the base o th mount
    is rankd with all deserts all kind of natures
    that labour on the bosom of this sphere
    to propagate their states <SENTENCE-END>  amongst them all
    whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixd
    one do i personate of lord timons frame
    whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
    whose present grace to present slaves and servants
    translates his rivals <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  tis conceivd to scope <SENTENCE-END> 
    this throne this fortune and this hill methinks
    with one man beckond from the rest below
    bowing his head against the steepy mount
    to climb his happiness would be well expressd
    in our condition <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  nay sir but hear me on <SENTENCE-END> 
    all those which were his fellows but of late
    some better than his value on the moment
    follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance  
    rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
    make sacred even his stirrup and through him
    drink the free air <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  ay marry what of these
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  when fortune in her shift and change of mood
    spurns down her late beloved all his dependants
    which labourd after him to the mountains top
    even on their knees and hands let him slip down
    not one accompanying his declining foot <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  tis common <SENTENCE-END> 
    a thousand moral paintings i can show
    that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortunes
    more pregnantly than words <SENTENCE-END>  yet you do well
    to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen
    the foot above the head <SENTENCE-END>

    draught is the readiest man to kill him <SENTENCE-END>  t has been proved <SENTENCE-END>  if

    often wishd myself poorer that i might come nearer to you <SENTENCE-END>  we
    are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call

  timon <SENTENCE-END>  you make me marvel wherefore ere this time
    had you not fully laid my state before me
    that i might so have rated my expense
    as i had leave of means <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  you would not hear me
    at many leisures i proposd <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  go to
    perchance some single vantages you took
    when my indisposition put you back
    and that unaptness made your minister
    thus to excuse yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  o my good lord
    at many times i brought in my accounts  
    laid them before you you would throw them off
    and say you found them in mine honesty <SENTENCE-END> 
    when for some trifling present you have bid me
    return so much i have shook my head and wept

    to hold your hand more close <SENTENCE-END>  i did endure
    not seldom nor no slight checks when i have
    prompted you in the ebb of your estate
    and your great flow of debts <SENTENCE-END>  my lovd lord
    though you hear now too late yet nows a time

    call me before th exactest auditors
    and set me on the proof <SENTENCE-END>  so the gods bless me
    when all our offices have been oppressd
    with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
    with drunken spilth of wine when every room

    why dost thou weep canst thou the conscience lack
    to think i shall lack friends secure thy heart
    if i would broach the vessels of my love
    and try the argument of hearts by borrowing
    men and mens fortunes could i frankly use

    and so intending other serious matters
    after distasteful looks and these hard fractions

    have their ingratitude in them hereditary <SENTENCE-END> 
    their blood is cakd tis cold it seldom flows
    tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind

scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
a public place

enter lucius with three strangers

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  who the lord timon he is my very good friend and an
    honourable gentleman <SENTENCE-END> 
  first stranger <SENTENCE-END>  we know him for no less though we are but
    strangers to him <SENTENCE-END>  but i can tell you one thing my lord and
    which i hear from common rumours now lord timons happy hours
    are done and past and his estate shrinks from him <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money <SENTENCE-END> 
  second stranger <SENTENCE-END>  but believe you this my lord that not long ago
     one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many
    talents nay urgd extremely fort and showed what necessity
    belongd tot and yet was denied <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  how
  second stranger <SENTENCE-END>  i tell you denied my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  what a strange case was that now before the gods i am
    ashamd ont <SENTENCE-END>  denied that honourable man there was very little
    honour showd int <SENTENCE-END>  for my own part i must needs confess i have
    received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels  
    and suchlike trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he
    mistook him and sent to me i should neer have denied his
    occasion so many talents <SENTENCE-END> 

                             enter servilius

  servilius <SENTENCE-END>  see by good hap yonders my lord i have sweat to see
    his honour <SENTENCE-END>  my honourd lord
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  servilius you are kindly met sir <SENTENCE-END>  fare thee well commend
    me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  servilius <SENTENCE-END>  may it please your honour my lord hath sent
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  ha what has he sent i am so much endeared to that lord
    hes ever sending <SENTENCE-END>  how shall i thank him thinkst thou and what
    has he sent now
  servilius <SENTENCE-END>  has only sent his present occasion now my lord
    requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
    talents <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  i know his lordship is but merry with me
    he cannot want fiftyfive hundred talents <SENTENCE-END> 
  servilius <SENTENCE-END>  but in the mean time he wants less my lord <SENTENCE-END>   
    if his occasion were not virtuous
    i should not urge it half so faithfully <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou speak seriously servilius
  servilius <SENTENCE-END>  upon my soul tis true sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such
    a good time when i might ha shown myself honourable how
    unluckily it happned that i should purchase the day before for a
    little part and undo a great deal of honour servilius now
    before the gods i am not able to do the more beast i say i
    was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can
    witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had donet
    now <SENTENCE-END>  commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his
    honour will conceive the fairest of me because i have no power
    to be kind <SENTENCE-END>  and tell him this from me i count it one of my
    greatest afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an
    honourable gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  good servilius will you befriend me so far
    as to use mine own words to him
  servilius <SENTENCE-END>  yes sir i shall <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  ill look you out a good turn servilius <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                  exit servilius  
    true as you said timon is shrunk indeed
    and he thats once denied will hardly speed <SENTENCE-END>             exit
  first stranger <SENTENCE-END>  do you observe this hostilius
  second stranger <SENTENCE-END>  ay too well <SENTENCE-END> 
  first stranger <SENTENCE-END>  why this is the worlds soul and just of the same
      piece
    is every flatterers spirit <SENTENCE-END>  who can call him his friend
    that dips in the same dish for in my knowing
    timon has been this lords father
    and kept his credit with his purse
    supported his estate nay timons money
    has paid his men their wages <SENTENCE-END>  he neer drinks
    but timons silver treads upon his lip
    and yet o see the monstrousness of man
    when he looks out in an ungrateful shape
    he does deny him in respect of his
    what charitable men afford to beggars <SENTENCE-END> 
  third stranger <SENTENCE-END>  religion groans at it <SENTENCE-END> 
  first stranger <SENTENCE-END>  for mine own part
    i never tasted timon in my life  
    nor came any of his bounties over me
    to mark me for his friend yet i protest
    for his right noble mind illustrious virtue
    and honourable carriage
    had his necessity made use of me
    i would have put my wealth into donation
    and the best half should have returnd to him
    so much i love his heart <SENTENCE-END>  but i perceive
    men must learn now with pity to dispense
    for policy sits above conscience <SENTENCE-END>                      exeunt




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
sempronius house

enter sempronius and a servant of timons

  sempronius <SENTENCE-END>  must he needs trouble me int hum bove all others
    he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus
    and now ventidius is wealthy too
    whom he redeemd from prison <SENTENCE-END>  all these
    owe their estates unto him <SENTENCE-END> 
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
    they have all been touchd and found base metal for
    they have all denied him <SENTENCE-END> 
  sempronius <SENTENCE-END>  how have they denied him
    has ventidius and lucullus denied him
    and does he send to me three humh
    it shows but little love or judgment in him <SENTENCE-END> 
    must i be his last refuge his friends like physicians
    thrice give him over <SENTENCE-END>  must i take th cure upon me
    has much disgracd me int im angry at him
    that might have known my place <SENTENCE-END>  i see no sense fort
    but his occasions might have wood me first  
    for in my conscience i was the first man
    that eer received gift from him <SENTENCE-END> 
    and does he think so backwardly of me now
    that ill requite it last no
    so it may prove an argument of laughter
    to th rest and i mongst lords be thought a fool <SENTENCE-END> 
    id rather than the worth of thrice the sum
    had sent to me first but for my minds sake
    id such a courage to do him good <SENTENCE-END>  but now return
    and with their faint reply this answer join
    who bates mine honour shall not know my coin <SENTENCE-END>            exit
  servant <SENTENCE-END>  excellent your lordships a goodly villain <SENTENCE-END>  the devil
    knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossd himself
    byt and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man
    will set him clear <SENTENCE-END>  how fairly this lord strives to appear foul
    takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot
    ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire <SENTENCE-END> 
    of such a nature is his politic love <SENTENCE-END> 
    this was my lords best hope now all are fled
    save only the gods <SENTENCE-END>  now his friends are dead  
    doors that were neer acquainted with their wards
    many a bounteous year must be employd
    now to guard sure their master <SENTENCE-END> 
    and this is all a liberal course allows
    who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house <SENTENCE-END>          exit




scene iv <SENTENCE-END> 
a hall in timons house

enter two of varros men meeting lucius servant and others
all being servants of timons creditors to wait for his coming out <SENTENCE-END> 
then enter titus and hortensius

  hortensius <SENTENCE-END>  lucius what do we meet together

    for mine is money <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  so is theirs and ours <SENTENCE-END> 

                          enter philotus

  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  so much
  philotus <SENTENCE-END>  is not my lord seen yet  
  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  not yet <SENTENCE-END> 
  philotus <SENTENCE-END>  i wonder ont he was wont to shine at seven <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  ay but the days are waxd shorter with him
    you must consider that a prodigal course
    is like the suns but not like his recoverable <SENTENCE-END> 
    i fear
    tis deepest winter in lord timons purse
    that is one may reach deep enough and yet
    find little <SENTENCE-END> 
  philotus <SENTENCE-END>  i am of your fear for that <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  ill show you how t observe a strange event <SENTENCE-END> 
    your lord sends now for money <SENTENCE-END> 
  hortensius <SENTENCE-END>  most true he does <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  and he wears jewels now of timons gift
    for which i wait for money <SENTENCE-END> 
  hortensius <SENTENCE-END>  it is against my heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  mark how strange it shows
    timon in this should pay more than he owes
    and een as if your lord should wear rich jewels
    and send for money for em <SENTENCE-END>   
  hortensius <SENTENCE-END>  im weary of this charge the gods can witness
    i know my lord hath spent of timons wealth
    and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth <SENTENCE-END> 
  first varros servant <SENTENCE-END>  yes mines three thousand crowns whats
    yours
  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  five thousand mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  first varros servant <SENTENCE-END>  tis much deep and it should seem by th
      sum
    your masters confidence was above mine
    else surely his had equalld <SENTENCE-END> 

                           enter flaminius

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  one of lord timons men <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  flaminius sir a word <SENTENCE-END>  pray is my lord ready to

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  do you hear sir
  second varros servant <SENTENCE-END>  by your leave sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  what do ye ask of me my friend
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  we wait for certain money here sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  ay
    if money were as certain as your waiting
    twere sure enough <SENTENCE-END> 
    why then preferrd you not your sums and bills
    when your false masters eat of my lords meat
    then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
    and take down th intrest into their gluttnous maws <SENTENCE-END> 
    you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
    let me pass quietly <SENTENCE-END> 
    believet my lord and i have made an end
    i have no more to reckon he to spend <SENTENCE-END>   
  lucius servant <SENTENCE-END>  ay but this answer will not serve <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  if twill not serve tis not so base as you
    for you serve knaves <SENTENCE-END>                                    exit
  first varros servant <SENTENCE-END>  how what does his cashierd worship mutter
  second varros servant <SENTENCE-END>  no matter what hes poor and thats

scene v <SENTENCE-END> 
the senate house

enter three senators at one door alcibiades meeting them with attendants

  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  my lord you have my voice tot the faults bloody <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis necessary he should die
    nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  most true the law shall bruise him <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  honour health and compassion to the senate
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  now captain
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  i am an humble suitor to your virtues
    for pity is the virtue of the law
    and none but tyrants use it cruelly <SENTENCE-END> 
    it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
    upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
    hath steppd into the law which is past depth
    to those that without heed do plunge intot <SENTENCE-END> 
    he is a man setting his fate aside
    of comely virtues
    nor did he soil the fact with cowardice  
    an honour in him which buys out his fault
    but with a noble fury and fair spirit
    seeing his reputation touchd to death
    he did oppose his foe
    and with such sober and unnoted passion
    he did behove his anger ere twas spent
    as if he had but provd an argument <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  you undergo too strict a paradox
    striving to make an ugly deed look fair
    your words have took such pains as if they labourd
    to bring manslaughter into form and set
    quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed
    is valour misbegot and came into the world
    when sects and factions were newly born <SENTENCE-END> 
    hes truly valiant that can wisely suffer
    the worst that man can breathe
    and make his wrongs his outsides
    to wear them like his raiment carelessly
    and neer prefer his injuries to his heart
    to bring it into danger <SENTENCE-END>   
    if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
    what folly tis to hazard life for ill
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  you cannot make gross sins look clear
    to revenge is no valour but to bear <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  my lords then under favour pardon me
    if i speak like a captain
    why do fond men expose themselves to battle
    and not endure all threats sleep upont
    and let the foes quietly cut their throats
    without repugnancy if there be
    such valour in the bearing what make we
    abroad why then women are more valiant
    that stay at home if bearing carry it
    and the ass more captain than the lion the fellow
    loaden with irons wiser than the judge
    if wisdom be in suffering <SENTENCE-END>  o my lords
    as you are great be pitifully good <SENTENCE-END> 
    who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
    to kill i grant is sins extremest gust  
    but in defence by mercy tis most just <SENTENCE-END> 
    to be in anger is impiety
    but who is man that is not angry
    weigh but the crime with this <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  you breathe in vain <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  in vain his service done
    at lacedaemon and byzantium
    were a sufficient briber for his life <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  whats that
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  why i say my lords has done fair service
    and slain in fight many of your enemies
    how full of valour did he bear himself
    in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  he has made too much plenty with em <SENTENCE-END> 
    hes a sworn rioter he has a sin that often
    drowns him and takes his valour prisoner <SENTENCE-END> 
    if there were no foes that were enough
    to overcome him <SENTENCE-END>  in that beastly fury
    he has been known to commit outrages
    and cherish factions <SENTENCE-END>  tis inferrd to us  
    his days are foul and his drink dangerous <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  he dies <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  hard fate he might have died in war <SENTENCE-END> 
    my lords if not for any parts in him
    though his right arm might purchase his own time
    and be in debt to none yet more to move you
    take my deserts to his and join em both
    and for i know your reverend ages love
    security ill pawn my victories all
    my honours to you upon his good returns <SENTENCE-END> 
    if by this crime he owes the law his life
    why let the war receivet in valiant gore
    for law is strict and war is nothing more <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  we are for law he dies <SENTENCE-END>  urge it no more
    on height of our displeasure <SENTENCE-END>  friend or brother
    he forfeits his own blood that spills another <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  must it be so it must not be <SENTENCE-END>  my lords
    i do beseech you know me <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  how
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  call me to your remembrances <SENTENCE-END>   
  third senator <SENTENCE-END>  what
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot think but your age has forgot me
    it could not else be i should prove so base
    to sue and be denied such common grace <SENTENCE-END> 
    my wounds ache at you <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  do you dare our anger
    tis in few words but spacious in effect
    we banish thee for ever <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  banish me
    banish your dotage banish usury
    that makes the senate ugly <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  if after two days shine athens contain thee
    attend our weightier judgment <SENTENCE-END>  and not to swell our spirit
    he shall be executed presently <SENTENCE-END>               exeunt senators
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
    only in bone that none may look on you
    im worse than mad i have kept back their foes
    while they have told their money and let out
    their coin upon large interest i myself
    rich only in large hurts <SENTENCE-END>  all those for this  
    is this the balsam that the usuring senate
    pours into captains wounds banishment
    it comes not ill i hate not to be banishd
    it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
    that i may strike at athens <SENTENCE-END>  ill cheer up
    my discontented troops and lay for hearts <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis honour with most lands to be at odds
    soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods <SENTENCE-END>          exit

    of his several friends <SENTENCE-END> 
  second lord <SENTENCE-END>  it should not be by the persuasion of his new
    feasting <SENTENCE-END>

    o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
    who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
    since riches point to misery and contempt
    who would be so mockd with glory or to live
    but in a dream of friendship
    to have his pomp and all what state compounds
    but only painted like his varnishd friends
    poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
    undone by goodness strange unusual blood
    when mans worst sin is he does too much good
    who then dares to be half so kind again
    for bounty that makes gods does still mar men <SENTENCE-END> 
    my dearest lord blest to be most accurst
    rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes
    are made thy chief afflictions <SENTENCE-END>  alas kind lord

                         enter flavius to timon
  
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  o you gods
    is yond despisd and ruinous man my lord
    full of decay and failing o monument
    and wonder of good deeds evilly bestowd
    what an alteration of honour
    has desprate want made
    what viler thing upon the earth than friends
    who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
    how rarely does it meet with this times guise
    when man was wishd to love his enemies
    grant i may ever love and rather woo
    those that would mischief me than those that do
    has caught me in his eye i will present
    my honest grief unto him and as my lord
    still serve him with my life <SENTENCE-END>  my dearest master
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  away what art thou
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  have you forgot me sir
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  why dost ask that i have forgot all men
    then if thou grantst thart a man i have forgot thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  an honest poor servant of yours <SENTENCE-END>   
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  then i know thee not <SENTENCE-END> 
    i never had honest man about me i <SENTENCE-END> 
    all i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  the gods are witness
    nevr did poor steward wear a truer grief
    for his undone lord than mine eyes for you <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  what dost thou weep come nearer <SENTENCE-END>  then i love thee
    because thou art a woman and disclaimst
    flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
    but thorough lust and laughter <SENTENCE-END>  pitys sleeping <SENTENCE-END> 
    strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  i beg of you to know me good my lord
    t accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
    to entertain me as your steward still <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  had i a steward
    so true so just and now so comfortable
    it almost turns my dangerous nature mild <SENTENCE-END> 
    let me behold thy face <SENTENCE-END>  surely this man
    was born of woman <SENTENCE-END> 
    forgive my general and exceptless rashness  
    you perpetualsober gods i do proclaim
    one honest man mistake me not but one
    no more i pray and hes a steward <SENTENCE-END> 
    how fain would i have hated all mankind
    and thou redeemst thyself <SENTENCE-END>  but all save thee
    i fell with curses <SENTENCE-END> 
    methinks thou art more honest now than wise
    for by oppressing and betraying me
    thou mightst have sooner got another service
    for many so arrive at second masters
    upon their first lords neck <SENTENCE-END>  but tell me true
    for i must ever doubt though neer so sure
    is not thy kindness subtle covetous
    if not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
    expecting in return twenty for one
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  no my most worthy master in whose breast
    doubt and suspect alas are placd too late
    you should have feard false times when you did feast
    suspect still comes where an estate is least <SENTENCE-END> 
    that which i show heaven knows is merely love  
    duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
    care of your food and living and believe it
    my most honourd lord
    for any benefit that points to me
    either in hope or present id exchange
    for this one wish that you had power and wealth
    to requite me by making rich yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  look thee tis so thou singly honest man
    here take <SENTENCE-END>  the gods out of my misery
    have sent thee treasure <SENTENCE-END>  go live rich and happy
    but thus conditiond thou shalt build from men
    hate all curse all show charity to none
    but let the famishd flesh slide from the bone
    ere thou relieve the beggar <SENTENCE-END>  give to dogs
    what thou deniest to men let prisons swallow em
    debts wither em to nothing <SENTENCE-END>  be men like blasted woods
    and may diseases lick up their false bloods
    and so farewell and thrive <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  o let me stay
    and comfort you my master <SENTENCE-END>   
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  if thou hatst curses
    stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free <SENTENCE-END> 
    neer see thou man and let me neer see thee <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                exeunt severally

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
the woods <SENTENCE-END>  before timons cave

enter poet and painter

  painter <SENTENCE-END>  as i took note of the place it cannot be far where he
    abides <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  to be thought of him does the rumour hold for true that hes
    so full of gold
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  certain <SENTENCE-END>  alcibiades reports it phrynia and timandra had
    gold of him <SENTENCE-END>  he likewise enrichd poor straggling soldiers with
    great quantity <SENTENCE-END>  tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  nothing else <SENTENCE-END>  you shall see him a palm in athens again
    and flourish with the highest <SENTENCE-END>  therefore tis not amiss we tender
    our loves to him in this supposd distress of his it will show
    honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what
    they travail for if it be just and true report that goes of his
    having <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  what have you now to present unto him
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  nothing at this time but my visitation only i will
    promise him an excellent piece <SENTENCE-END>   
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  i must serve him so too tell him of an intent thats coming
    toward him <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  good as the best <SENTENCE-END>  promising is the very air o th time
    it opens the eyes of expectation <SENTENCE-END>  performance is ever the duller
    for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people
    the deed of saying is quite out of use <SENTENCE-END>  to promise is most
    courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or
    testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that
    makes it <SENTENCE-END> 

                    enter timon from his cave

  timon <SENTENCE-END>  aside excellent workman thou canst not paint a man so bad
    as is thyself <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him <SENTENCE-END>  it
    must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness
    of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that
    follow youth and opulency <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  aside must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own
    work wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men do so i have  
    gold for thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  nay lets seek him
    then do we sin against our own estate
    when we may profit meet and come too late <SENTENCE-END> 
  painter <SENTENCE-END>  true
    when the day serves before blackcornerd night
    find what thou wantst by free and offerd light <SENTENCE-END> 
    come <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  aside ill meet you at the turn <SENTENCE-END>  what a gods gold
    that he is worshippd in a baser temple
    than where swine feed
    tis thou that rigst the bark and ploughst the foam
    settlest admired reverence in a slave <SENTENCE-END> 
    to thee be worship and thy saints for aye
    be crownd with plagues that thee alone obey
    fit i meet them <SENTENCE-END>                    advancing from his cave
  poet <SENTENCE-END>  hail worthy timon

                    enter flavius and two senators

  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  it is vain that you would speak with timon
    for he is set so only to himself
    that nothing but himself which looks like man
    is friendly with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  bring us to his cave <SENTENCE-END> 
    it is our part and promise to th athenians
    to speak with timon <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  at all times alike
    men are not still the same twas time and griefs
    that framd him thus <SENTENCE-END>  time with his fairer hand
    offering the fortunes of his former days  
    the former man may make him <SENTENCE-END>  bring us to him
    and chance it as it may <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  here is his cave <SENTENCE-END> 
    peace and content be here lord timon timon
    look out and speak to friends <SENTENCE-END>  th athenians
    by two of their most reverend senate greet thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    speak to them noble timon <SENTENCE-END> 

                   enter timon out of his cave

  timon <SENTENCE-END>  thou sun that comforts burn <SENTENCE-END>  speak and be hangd
    for each true word a blister and each false
    be as a cauterizing to the root o th tongue
    consuming it with speaking
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  worthy timon
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  of none but such as you and you of timon <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  the senators of athens greet thee timon <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  i thank them and would send them back the plague
    could i but catch it for them <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  o forget  
    what we are sorry for ourselves in thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    the senators with one consent of love
    entreat thee back to athens who have thought
    on special dignities which vacant lie
    for thy best use and wearing <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  they confess
    toward thee forgetfulness too general gross
    which now the public body which doth seldom
    play the recanter feeling in itself
    a lack of timons aid hath sense withal
    of it own fail restraining aid to timon
    and send forth us to make their sorrowed render
    together with a recompense more fruitful
    than their offence can weigh down by the dram
    ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
    as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
    and write in thee the figures of their love
    ever to read them thine <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  you witch me in it
    surprise me to the very brink of tears <SENTENCE-END>   
    lend me a fools heart and a womans eyes
    and ill beweep these comforts worthy senators <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  therefore so please thee to return with us
    and of our athens thine and ours to take
    the captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
    allowd with absolute power and thy good name
    live with authority <SENTENCE-END>  so soon we shall drive back
    of alcibiades th approaches wild
    who like a boar too savage doth root up
    his countrys peace <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  and shakes his threatning sword
    against the walls of athens <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  therefore timon
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  well sir i will <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i will sir thus
    if alcibiades kill my countrymen
    let alcibiades know this of timon
    that timon cares not <SENTENCE-END>  but if he sack fair athens
    and take our goodly aged men by th beards
    giving our holy virgins to the stain
    of contumelious beastly madbraind war  
    then let him know and tell him timon speaks it
    in pity of our aged and our youth
    i cannot choose but tell him that i care not
    and let him taket at worst for their knives care not
    while you have throats to answer <SENTENCE-END>  for myself
    theres not a whittle in th unruly camp
    but i do prize it at my love before
    the reverendst throat in athens <SENTENCE-END>  so i leave you
    to the protection of the prosperous gods
    as thieves to keepers <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  stay not alls in vain <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  why i was writing of my epitaph
    it will be seen tomorrow <SENTENCE-END>  my long sickness
    of health and living now begins to mend
    and nothing brings me all things <SENTENCE-END>  go live still
    be alcibiades your plague you his
    and last so long enough
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  we speak in vain <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  but yet i love my country and am not
    one that rejoices in the common wreck  
    as common bruit doth put it <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  thats well spoke <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  commend me to my loving countrymen
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  these words become your lips as they pass through
    them <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  and enter in our ears like great triumphers
    in their applauding gates <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  commend me to them
    and tell them that to ease them of their griefs
    their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
    their pangs of love with other incident throes
    that natures fragile vessel doth sustain
    in lifes uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them
    ill teach them to prevent wild alcibiades wrath <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  i like this well he will return again <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  i have a tree which grows here in my close
    that mine own use invites me to cut down
    and shortly must i fell it <SENTENCE-END>  tell my friends
    tell athens in the sequence of degree
    from high to low throughout that whoso please  
    to stop affliction let him take his haste
    come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
    and hang himself <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you do my greeting <SENTENCE-END> 
  flavius <SENTENCE-END>  trouble him no further thus you still shall find him <SENTENCE-END> 
  timon <SENTENCE-END>  come not to me again but say to athens
    timon hath made his everlasting mansion
    upon the beached verge of the salt flood
    who once a day with his embossed froth
    the turbulent surge shall cover <SENTENCE-END>  thither come
    and let my gravestone be your oracle <SENTENCE-END> 
    lips let sour words go by and language end
    what is amiss plague and infection mend
    graves only be mens works and death their gain
    sun hide thy beams <SENTENCE-END>  timon hath done his reign <SENTENCE-END> 
                                        exit timon into his cave
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  his discontents are unremovably
    coupled to nature <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  our hope in him is dead <SENTENCE-END>  let us return
    and strain what other means is left unto us
    in our dear peril <SENTENCE-END>

  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  i met a courier one mine ancient friend
    whom though in general part we were opposd
    yet our old love had a particular force
    and made us speak like friends <SENTENCE-END>  this man was riding
    from alcibiades to timons cave
    with letters of entreaty which imported
    his fellowship i th cause against your city
    in part for his sake movd <SENTENCE-END>

  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  here come our brothers <SENTENCE-END> 
  third senator <SENTENCE-END>  no talk of timon nothing of him expect <SENTENCE-END> 
    the enemies drum is heard and fearful scouring

    ours is the fall i fear our foes the snare <SENTENCE-END>          exeunt




scene iii <SENTENCE-END>

scene iv <SENTENCE-END> 
before the walls of athens

trumpets sound <SENTENCE-END>  enter alcibiades with his powers before athens

  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  sound to this coward and lascivious town
    our terrible approach <SENTENCE-END> 

       sound a parley <SENTENCE-END>  the senators appear upon the walls

    till now you have gone on and filld the time
    with all licentious measure making your wills
    the scope of justice till now myself and such
    as slept within the shadow of your power
    have wanderd with our traversd arms and breathd
    our sufferance vainly <SENTENCE-END>  now the time is flush
    when crouching marrow in the bearer strong
    cries of itself no more now breathless wrong
    shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
    and pursy insolence shall break his wind
    with fear and horrid flight <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  noble and young  
    when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
    ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
    we sent to thee to give thy rages balm
    to wipe out our ingratitude with loves
    above their quantity <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  so did we woo
    transformed timon to our citys love
    by humble message and by promisd means <SENTENCE-END> 
    we were not all unkind nor all deserve
    the common stroke of war <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  these walls of ours
    were not erected by their hands from whom
    you have receivd your griefs nor are they such
    that these great towrs trophies and schools should fall
    for private faults in them <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  nor are they living
    who were the motives that you first went out
    shame that they wanted cunning in excess
    hath broke their hearts <SENTENCE-END>  march noble lord
    into our city with thy banners spread <SENTENCE-END>   
    by decimation and a tithed death
    if thy revenges hunger for that food
    which nature loathes take thou the destind tenth
    and by the hazard of the spotted die
    let die the spotted <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  all have not offended
    for those that were it is not square to take
    on those that are revenge crimes like lands
    are not inherited <SENTENCE-END>  then dear countryman
    bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
    spare thy athenian cradle and those kin
    which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
    with those that have offended <SENTENCE-END>  like a shepherd
    approach the fold and cull th infected forth
    but kill not all together <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  what thou wilt
    thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
    than hew tot with thy sword <SENTENCE-END> 
  first senator <SENTENCE-END>  set but thy foot
    against our rampird gates and they shall ope  
    so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
    to say thout enter friendly <SENTENCE-END> 
  second senator <SENTENCE-END>  throw thy glove
    or any token of thine honour else
    that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
    and not as our confusion all thy powers
    shall make their harbour in our town till we
    have seald thy full desire <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  then theres my glove
    descend and open your uncharged ports <SENTENCE-END> 
    those enemies of timons and mine own
    whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
    fall and no more <SENTENCE-END>  and to atone your fears
    with my more noble meaning not a man
    shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
    of regular justice in your citys bounds
    but shall be renderd to your public laws
    at heaviest answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  both <SENTENCE-END>  tis most nobly spoken <SENTENCE-END> 
  alcibiades <SENTENCE-END>  descend and keep your words <SENTENCE-END>   
                       the senators descend and open the gates

                 enter a soldier as a messenger

  soldier <SENTENCE-END>  my noble general timon is dead
    entombd upon the very hem o th sea
    and on his gravestone this insculpture which
    with wax i brought away whose soft impression
    interprets for my poor ignorance <SENTENCE-END> 

                  alcibiades reads the epitaph

    here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft
    seek not my name <SENTENCE-END>  a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left
    here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate <SENTENCE-END> 
    pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy
      gait <SENTENCE-END> 
    these well express in thee thy latter spirits <SENTENCE-END> 
    though thou abhorrdst in us our human griefs
    scorndst our brains flow and those our droplets which  
    from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit
    taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye
    on thy low grave on faults forgiven <SENTENCE-END>  dead
    is noble timon of whose memory
    hereafter more <SENTENCE-END>  bring me into your city
    and i will use the olive with my sword
    make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
    prescribe to other as each others leech <SENTENCE-END> 
    let our drums strike <SENTENCE-END>                                  exeunt

saturninus and his followers at one door and bassianus and his followers
at the other with drums and trumpets

  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  noble patricians patrons of my right
    defend the justice of my cause with arms
    and countrymen my loving followers
    plead my successive title with your swords <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am his first born son that was the last
    that ware the imperial diadem of rome
    then let my fathers honours live in me
    nor wrong mine age with this indignity <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  romans friends followers favourers of my right
    if ever bassianus caesars son
    were gracious in the eyes of royal rome
    keep then this passage to the capitol
    and suffer not dishonour to approach
    the imperial seat to virtue consecrate  
    to justice continence and nobility
    but let desert in pure election shine
    and romans fight for freedom in your choice <SENTENCE-END> 

        enter marcus andronicus aloft with the crown

  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  princes that strive by factions and by friends
    ambitiously for rule and empery
    know that the people of rome for whom we stand
    a special party have by common voice
    in election for the roman empery
    chosen andronicus surnamed pius
    for many good and great deserts to rome <SENTENCE-END> 
    a nobler man a braver warrior
    lives not this day within the city walls <SENTENCE-END> 
    he by the senate is accited home
    from weary wars against the barbarous goths
    that with his sons a terror to our foes
    hath yokd a nation strong traind up in arms <SENTENCE-END> 
    ten years are spent since first he undertook  
    this cause of rome and chastised with arms
    our enemies pride five times he hath returnd
    bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons
    in coffins from the field and at this day
    to the monument of that andronici
    done sacrifice of expiation
    and slain the noblest prisoner of the goths <SENTENCE-END> 
    and now at last laden with honours spoils
    returns the good andronicus to rome
    renowned titus flourishing in arms <SENTENCE-END> 
    let us entreat by honour of his name
    whom worthily you would have now succeed
    and in the capitol and senates right
    whom you pretend to honour and adore
    that you withdraw you and abate your strength
    dismiss your followers and as suitors should
    plead your deserts in peace and humbleness <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  marcus andronicus so i do affy
    in thy uprightness and integrity  
    and so i love and honour thee and thine
    thy noble brother titus and his sons
    and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
    gracious lavinia romes rich ornament
    that i will here dismiss my loving friends
    and to my fortunes and the peoples favour
    commit my cause in balance to be weighd <SENTENCE-END> 
                                exeunt the soldiers of bassianus
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  friends that have been thus forward in my right
    i thank you all and here dismiss you all
    and to the love and favour of my country
    commit myself my person and the cause <SENTENCE-END> 
                               exeunt the soldiers of saturninus
    rome be as just and gracious unto me
    as i am confident and kind to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    open the gates and let me in <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  tribunes and me a poor competitor <SENTENCE-END> 
                    flourish <SENTENCE-END>  they go up into the senate house

                      enter a captain  

  captain <SENTENCE-END>  romans make way <SENTENCE-END>  the good andronicus
    patron of virtue romes best champion
    successful in the battles that he fights
    with honour and with fortune is returnd
    from where he circumscribed with his sword
    and brought to yoke the enemies of rome <SENTENCE-END> 

        sound drums and trumpets and then enter martius
        and mutius two of titus sons and then two men
        bearing a coffin covered with black then lucius
        and quintus two other sons then titus andronicus
        and then tamora the queen of goths with her three
        sons alarbus demetrius and chiron with aaron the
        moor and others  as many as can be <SENTENCE-END>  then set down
        the coffin and titus speaks

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  hail rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
    lo as the bark that hath dischargd her fraught
    returns with precious lading to the bay  
    from whence at first she weighd her anchorage
    cometh andronicus bound with laurel boughs
    to resalute his country with his tears
    tears of true joy for his return to rome <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou great defender of this capitol
    stand gracious to the rites that we intend
    romans of five and twenty valiant sons
    half of the number that king priam had
    behold the poor remains alive and dead
    these that survive let rome reward with love
    these that i bring unto their latest home
    with burial amongst their ancestors <SENTENCE-END> 
    here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword <SENTENCE-END> 
    titus unkind and careless of thine own
    why sufferst thou thy sons unburied yet
    to hover on the dreadful shore of styx
    make way to lay them by their brethren <SENTENCE-END> 
                                            they open the tomb
    there greet in silence as the dead are wont
    and sleep in peace slain in your countrys wars <SENTENCE-END>   
    o sacred receptacle of my joys
    sweet cell of virtue and nobility
    how many sons hast thou of mine in store
    that thou wilt never render to me more
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  give us the proudest prisoner of the goths
    that we may hew his limbs and on a pile
    ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
    before this earthy prison of their bones
    that so the shadows be not unappeasd
    nor we disturbd with prodigies on earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  i give him you the noblest that survives
    the eldest son of this distressed queen <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  stay roman brethen gracious conqueror
    victorious titus rue the tears i shed
    a mothers tears in passion for her son
    and if thy sons were ever dear to thee
    o think my son to be as dear to me
    sufficeth not that we are brought to rome
    to beautify thy triumphs and return
    captive to thee and to thy roman yoke  
    but must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
    for valiant doings in their countrys cause
    o if to fight for king and commonweal
    were piety in thine it is in these <SENTENCE-END> 
    andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
    draw near them then in being merciful <SENTENCE-END> 
    sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge <SENTENCE-END> 
    thricenoble titus spare my firstborn son <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  patient yourself madam and pardon me <SENTENCE-END> 
    these are their brethren whom your goths beheld
    alive and dead and for their brethren slain
    religiously they ask a sacrifice <SENTENCE-END> 
    to this your son is markd and die he must
    t appease their groaning shadows that are gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  away with him and make a fire straight
    and with our swords upon a pile of wood
    lets hew his limbs till they be clean consumd <SENTENCE-END> 
                                exeunt titus sons with alarbus
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  o cruel irreligious piety  
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  was never scythia half so barbarous
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  oppose not scythia to ambitious rome <SENTENCE-END> 
    alarbus goes to rest and we survive
    to tremble under titus threatning look <SENTENCE-END> 
    then madam stand resolvd but hope withal
    the selfsame gods that armd the queen of troy
    with opportunity of sharp revenge
    upon the thracian tyrant in his tent
    may favour tamora the queen of goths
    when goths were goths and tamora was queen
    to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes <SENTENCE-END> 

            reenter lucius quintus martius and
   mutius the sons of andronicus with their swords bloody

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  see lord and father how we have performd
    our roman rites alarbus limbs are loppd
    and entrails feed the sacrificing fire
    whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky <SENTENCE-END> 
    remaineth nought but to inter our brethren  
    and with loud larums welcome them to rome <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  let it be so and let andronicus
    make this his latest farewell to their souls <SENTENCE-END> 
                 sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb
    in peace and honour rest you here my sons
    romes readiest champions repose you here in rest
    secure from worldly chances and mishaps
    here lurks no treason here no envy swells
    here grow no damned drugs here are no storms

act ii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
rome <SENTENCE-END>  before the palace

enter aaron

  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  now climbeth tamora olympus top
    safe out of fortunes shot and sits aloft
    secure of thunders crack or lightning flash
    advancd above pale envys threatning reach <SENTENCE-END> 
    as when the golden sun salutes the morn
    and having gilt the ocean with his beams
    gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
    and overlooks the highestpeering hills
    so tamora <SENTENCE-END> 
    upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
    and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown <SENTENCE-END> 
    then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
    to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
    and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long <SENTENCE-END> 
    hast prisoner held fettred in amorous chains
    and faster bound to aarons charming eyes
    than is prometheus tied to caucasus <SENTENCE-END>   
    away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
    i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
    to wait upon this newmade emperess <SENTENCE-END> 
    to wait said i to wanton with this queen
    this goddess this semiramis this nymph
    this siren that will charm romes saturnine
    and see his shipwreck and his commonweals <SENTENCE-END> 
    hullo what storm is this

            enter chiron and demetrius braving

  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  chiron thy years wants wit thy wits wants edge
    and manners to intrude where i am gracd
    and may for aught thou knowest affected be <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  demetrius thou dost overween in all
    and so in this to bear me down with braves <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis not the difference of a year or two
    makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
    i am as able and as fit as thou
    to serve and to deserve my mistress grace  
    and that my sword upon thee shall approve
    and plead my passions for lavinias love <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>   aside  clubs clubs these lovers will not keep the
    peace <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  why boy although our mother unadvisd
    gave you a dancing rapier by your side
    are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
    go to have your lath glued within your sheath
    till you know better how to handle it <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  meanwhile sir with the little skill i have
    full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  ay boy grow ye so brave              they draw
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>   coming forward  why how now lords
    so near the emperors palace dare ye draw
    and maintain such a quarrel openly
    full well i wot the ground of all this grudge
    i would not for a million of gold
    the cause were known to them it most concerns
    nor would your noble mother for much more
    be so dishonoured in the court of rome <SENTENCE-END>   
    for shame put up <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  not i till i have sheathd
    my rapier in his bosom and withal
    thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
    that he hath breathd in my dishonour here <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  for that i am prepard and full resolvd
    foulspoken coward that thundrest with thy tongue
    and with thy weapon nothing darst perform <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  away i say
    now by the gods that warlike goths adore
    this pretty brabble will undo us all <SENTENCE-END> 
    why lords and think you not how dangerous
    it is to jet upon a princes right
    what is lavinia then become so loose
    or bassianus so degenerate
    that for her love such quarrels may be broachd
    without controlment justice or revenge
    young lords beware an should the empress know
    this discords ground the music would not please <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  i care not i knew she and all the world  
    i love lavinia more than all the world <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
    lavina is thine elder brothers hope <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  why are ye mad or know ye not in rome
    how furious and impatient they be
    and cannot brook competitors in love
    i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
    by this device <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  aaron a thousand deaths
    would i propose to achieve her whom i love <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  to achieve her how
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  why makst thou it so strange
    she is a woman therefore may be wood
    she is a woman therefore may be won
    she is lavinia therefore must be lovd <SENTENCE-END> 
    what man more water glideth by the mill
    than wots the miller of and easy it is
    of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know <SENTENCE-END> 
    though bassianus be the emperors brother
    better than he have worn vulcans badge <SENTENCE-END>   
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>   aside  ay and as good as saturninus may <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  then why should he despair that knows to court it
    with words fair looks and liberality
    what hast not thou full often struck a doe
    and borne her cleanly by the keepers nose
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  why then it seems some certain snatch or so
    would serve your turns <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  ay so the turn were served <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  aaron thou hast hit it <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  would you had hit it too
    then should not we be tird with this ado <SENTENCE-END> 
    why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
    to square for this would it offend you then
    that both should speed
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  faith not me <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  nor me so i were one <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  for shame be friends and join for that you jar <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis policy and stratagem must do
    that you affect and so must you resolve
    that what you cannot as you would achieve  
    you must perforce accomplish as you may <SENTENCE-END> 
    take this of me lucrece was not more chaste
    than this lavinia bassianus love <SENTENCE-END> 
    a speedier course than lingring languishment
    must we pursue and i have found the path <SENTENCE-END> 
    my lords a solemn hunting is in hand
    there will the lovely roman ladies troop
    the forest walks are wide and spacious
    and many unfrequented plots there are
    fitted by kind for rape and villainy <SENTENCE-END> 
    single you thither then this dainty doe
    and strike her home by force if not by words <SENTENCE-END> 
    this way or not at all stand you in hope <SENTENCE-END> 
    come come our empress with her sacred wit
    to villainy and vengeance consecrate
    will we acquaint with all what we intend
    and she shall file our engines with advice
    that will not suffer you to square yourselves
    but to your wishes height advance you both <SENTENCE-END> 
    the emperors court is like the house of fame  
    the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
    the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull <SENTENCE-END> 
    there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns
    there serve your lust shadowed from heavens eye
    and revel in lavinias treasury <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  sit fas aut nefas till i find the stream
    to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits
    per styga per manes vehor <SENTENCE-END>                            exeunt




scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
a forest near rome

enter titus andronicus and his three sons lucius quintus martius
making a noise with hounds and horns and marcus

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  the hunt is up the morn is bright and grey
    the fields are fragrant and the woods are green <SENTENCE-END> 
    uncouple here and let us make a bay
    and wake the emperor and his lovely bride
    and rouse the prince and ring a hunters peal
    that all the court may echo with the noise <SENTENCE-END> 
    sons let it be your charge as it is ours
    to attend the emperors person carefully <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have been troubled in my sleep this night
    but dawning day new comfort hath inspird <SENTENCE-END> 

         here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal <SENTENCE-END> 
       then enter saturninus tamora bassianus lavinia
            chiron demetrius and their attendants  
    many good morrows to your majesty
    madam to you as many and as good
    i promised your grace a hunters peal <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  and you have rung it lustily my lords
    somewhat too early for newmarried ladies <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  lavinia how say you
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  i say no
    i have been broad awake two hours and more <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  come on then horse and chariots let us have
    and to our sport <SENTENCE-END>   to tamora  madam now shall ye see
    our roman hunting <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  i have dogs my lord
    will rouse the proudest panther in the chase
    and climb the highest promontory top <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  and i have horse will follow where the game
    makes way and run like swallows oer the plain <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
    but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground <SENTENCE-END>              exeunt




scene iii <SENTENCE-END> 
a lonely part of the forest

enter aaron alone with a bag of gold

  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  he that had wit would think that i had none
    to bury so much gold under a tree
    and never after to inherit it <SENTENCE-END> 
    let him that thinks of me so abjectly
    know that this gold must coin a stratagem
    which cunningly effected will beget
    a very excellent piece of villainy <SENTENCE-END> 
    and so repose sweet gold for their unrest
                                                hides the gold
    that have their alms out of the empress chest <SENTENCE-END> 

               enter tamora alone to the moor

  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  my lovely aaron wherefore lookst thou sad
    when everything does make a gleeful boast
    the birds chant melody on every bush
    the snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun  
    the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
    and make a chequerd shadow on the ground
    under their sweet shade aaron let us sit
    and while the babbling echo mocks the hounds
    replying shrilly to the welltund horns
    as if a double hunt were heard at once
    let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise
    and after conflict such as was supposd
    the wandring prince and dido once enjoyed
    when with a happy storm they were surprisd
    and curtaind with a counselkeeping cave
    we may each wreathed in the others arms
    our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
    whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
    be unto us as is a nurses song
    of lullaby to bring her babe asleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  madam though venus govern your desires
    saturn is dominator over mine <SENTENCE-END> 
    what signifies my deadlystanding eye
    my silence and my cloudy melancholy  
    my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
    even as an adder when she doth unroll
    to do some fatal execution
    no madam these are no venereal signs <SENTENCE-END> 
    vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
    blood and revenge are hammering in my head <SENTENCE-END> 
    hark tamora the empress of my soul
    which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee
    this is the day of doom for bassianus
    his philomel must lose her tongue today
    thy sons make pillage of her chastity
    and wash their hands in bassianus blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    seest thou this letter take it up i pray thee
    and give the king this fatalplotted scroll <SENTENCE-END> 
    now question me no more we are espied <SENTENCE-END> 
    here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
    which dreads not yet their lives destruction <SENTENCE-END> 

                enter bassianus and lavinia
  
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  no more great empress bassianus comes <SENTENCE-END> 
    be cross with him and ill go fetch thy sons
    to back thy quarrels whatsoeer they be <SENTENCE-END>                exit
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  who have we here romes royal emperess
    unfurnishd of her wellbeseeming troop
    or is it dian habited like her
    who hath abandoned her holy groves
    to see the general hunting in this forest
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  saucy controller of my private steps
    had i the powr that some say dian had
    thy temples should be planted presently
    with horns as was actaeons and the hounds
    should drive upon thy newtransformed limbs
    unmannerly intruder as thou art
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  under your patience gentle emperess
    tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning
    and to be doubted that your moor and you
    are singled forth to try thy experiments <SENTENCE-END> 
    jove shield your husband from his hounds today  
    tis pity they should take him for a stag <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  believe me queen your swarth cimmerian
    doth make your honour of his bodys hue
    spotted detested and abominable <SENTENCE-END> 
    why are you sequestred from all your train
    dismounted from your snowwhite goodly steed
    and wandred hither to an obscure plot
    accompanied but with a barbarous moor
    if foul desire had not conducted you
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  and being intercepted in your sport
    great reason that my noble lord be rated
    for sauciness <SENTENCE-END>  i pray you let us hence
    and let her joy her ravencoloured love
    this valley fits the purpose passing well <SENTENCE-END> 
  bassianus <SENTENCE-END>  the king my brother shall have notice of this <SENTENCE-END> 
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  ay for these slips have made him noted long <SENTENCE-END> 
    good king to be so mightily abused
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  why i have patience to endure all this <SENTENCE-END> 

                  enter chiron and demetrius  

  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
    why doth your highness look so pale and wan
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  have i not reason think you to look pale
    these two have ticed me hither to this place <SENTENCE-END> 
    a barren detested vale you see it is
    the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
    overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe
    here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
    unless the nightly owl or fatal raven <SENTENCE-END> 
    and when they showd me this abhorred pit
    they told me here at dead time of the night
    a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
    ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
    would make such fearful and confused cries
    as any mortal body hearing it
    should straight fall mad or else die suddenly <SENTENCE-END> 
    no sooner had they told this hellish tale
    but straight they told me they would bind me here
    unto the body of a dismal yew  
    and leave me to this miserable death <SENTENCE-END> 
    and then they calld me foul adulteress
    lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms
    that ever ear did hear to such effect
    and had you not by wondrous fortune come
    this vengeance on me had they executed <SENTENCE-END> 
    revenge it as you love your mothers life
    or be ye not henceforth calld my children <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  this is a witness that i am thy son <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               stabs bassianus
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  and this for me struck home to show my strength <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                    also stabs
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora
    for no name fits thy nature but thy own
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  give me the poniard you shall know my boys
    your mothers hand shall right your mothers wrong <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  stay madam here is more belongs to her
    first thrash the corn then after burn the straw <SENTENCE-END> 
    this minion stood upon her chastity
    upon her nuptial vow her loyalty  
    and with that painted hope braves your mightiness
    and shall she carry this unto her grave
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  an if she do i would i were an eunuch <SENTENCE-END> 
    drag hence her husband to some secret hole
    and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  but when ye have the honey we desire
    let not this wasp outlive us both to sting <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  i warrant you madam we will make that sure <SENTENCE-END> 
    come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
    that nicepreserved honesty of yours <SENTENCE-END> 
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  o tamora thou bearest a womans face
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  i will not hear her speak away with her
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  listen fair madam let it be your glory
    to see her tears but be your heart to them
    as unrelenting flint to drops of rain <SENTENCE-END> 
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  when did the tigers young ones teach the dam
    o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee
    the milk thou suckdst from her did turn to marble
    even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny <SENTENCE-END>   
    yet every mother breeds not sons alike
    to chiron  do thou entreat her show a womans pity <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet have i heard o could i find it now
    the lion movd with pity did endure
    to have his princely paws pard all away <SENTENCE-END> 
    some say that ravens foster forlorn children
    the whilst their own birds famish in their nests
    o be to me though thy hard heart say no
    nothing so kind but something pitiful
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  i know not what it means away with her
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  o let me teach thee for my fathers sake
    that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee
    be not obdurate open thy deaf ears <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  hadst thou in person neer offended me
    even for his sake am i pitiless <SENTENCE-END> 
    remember boys i pourd forth tears in vain
    to save your brother from the sacrifice
    but fierce andronicus would not relent <SENTENCE-END>   
    therefore away with her and use her as you will
    the worse to her the better lovd of me <SENTENCE-END> 
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  o tamora be calld a gentle queen
    and with thine own hands kill me in this place
    for tis not life that i have beggd so long
    poor i was slain when bassianus died <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  what begst thou then fond woman let me go <SENTENCE-END> 
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  tis present death i beg and one thing more
    that womanhood denies my tongue to tell
    o keep me from their worse than killing lust
    and tumble me into some loathsome pit
    where never mans eye may behold my body
    do this and be a charitable murderer <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee
    no let them satisfy their lust on thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  away for thou hast stayd us here too long <SENTENCE-END> 
  lavinia <SENTENCE-END>  no grace no womanhood ah beastly creature

    this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him <SENTENCE-END> 

                 demetrius throws the body
           of bassianus into the pit then exeunt
         demetrius and chiron dragging off lavinia

  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  farewell my sons see that you make her sure <SENTENCE-END> 
    neer let my heart know merry cheer indeed
    till all the andronici be made away <SENTENCE-END> 
    now will i hence to seek my lovely moor
    and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower <SENTENCE-END>           exit

                  reenter aaron with two
             of titus sons quintus and martius

  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  come on my lords the better foot before
    straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit
    where i espied the panther fast asleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  my sight is very dull whateer it bodes <SENTENCE-END> 
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  and mine i promise you were it not for shame  
    well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile <SENTENCE-END> 
                                            falls into the pit
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  what art thou fallen what subtle hole is this
    whose mouth is covered with rudegrowing briers
    upon whose leaves are drops of newshed blood
    as fresh as morning dew distilld on flowers
    a very fatal place it seems to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  o brother with the dismalst object hurt
    that ever eye with sight made heart lament
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>   aside  now will i fetch the king to find them here
    that he thereby may have a likely guess
    how these were they that made away his brother <SENTENCE-END>          exit
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  why dost not comfort me and help me out
    from this unhallowd and bloodstained hole
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  i am surprised with an uncouth fear
    a chilling sweat oerruns my trembling joints
    my heart suspects more than mine eye can see <SENTENCE-END> 
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  to prove thou hast a true divining heart
    aaron and thou look down into this den  
    and see a fearful sight of blood and death <SENTENCE-END> 
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
    will not permit mine eyes once to behold
    the thing whereat it trembles by surmise
    o tell me who it is for neer till now
    was i a child to fear i know not what <SENTENCE-END> 
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  lord bassianus lies berayd in blood
    all on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb
    in this detested dark blooddrinking pit <SENTENCE-END> 
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  if it be dark how dost thou know tis he
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  upon his bloody finger he doth wear
    a precious ring that lightens all this hole
    which like a taper in some monument
    doth shine upon the dead mans earthy cheeks
    and shows the ragged entrails of this pit
    so pale did shine the moon on pyramus
    when he by night lay bathd in maiden blood <SENTENCE-END> 
    o brother help me with thy fainting hand
    if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath
    out of this fell devouring receptacle  
    as hateful as cocytus misty mouth <SENTENCE-END> 
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  reach me thy hand that i may help thee out
    or wanting strength to do thee so much good
    i may be pluckd into the swallowing womb
    of this deep pit poor bassianus grave <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink <SENTENCE-END> 
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  nor i no strength to climb without thy help <SENTENCE-END> 
  quintus <SENTENCE-END>  thy hand once more i will not loose again
    till thou art here aloft or i below <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou canst not come to me i come to thee <SENTENCE-END>         falls in

            enter the emperor and aaron the moor

  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  along with me ill see what hole is here
    and what he is that now is leapt into it <SENTENCE-END> 
    say who art thou that lately didst descend
    into this gaping hollow of the earth
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  the unhappy sons of old andronicus
    brought hither in a most unlucky hour
    to find thy brother bassianus dead <SENTENCE-END>   
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  my brother dead i know thou dost but jest
    he and his lady both are at the lodge
    upon the north side of this pleasant chase
    tis not an hour since i left them there <SENTENCE-END> 
  martius <SENTENCE-END>  we know not where you left them all alive
    but out alas here have we found him dead <SENTENCE-END> 

                   reenter tamora with
         attendants titus andronicus and lucius

  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  where is my lord the king
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  here tamora though grievd with killing grief <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  where is thy brother bassianus
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
    poor bassianus here lies murdered <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  then all too late i bring this fatal writ
    the complot of this timeless tragedy
    and wonder greatly that mans face can fold
    in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny <SENTENCE-END> 
                                 she giveth saturnine a letter  
    saturninus <SENTENCE-END>   reads  an if we miss to meet him handsomely
    sweet huntsman bassianus tis we mean
    do thou so much as dig the grave for him <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou knowst our meaning <SENTENCE-END>  look for thy reward
    among the nettles at the eldertree
    which overshades the mouth of that same pit
    where we decreed to bury bassianus <SENTENCE-END> 
    do this and purchase us thy lasting friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    o tamora was ever heard the like
    this is the pit and this the eldertree <SENTENCE-END> 
    look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
    that should have murdered bassianus here <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious lord here is the bag of gold <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>   to titus  two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody
      kind
    have here bereft my brother of his life <SENTENCE-END> 
    sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
    there let them bide until we have devisd
    some neverheardof torturing pain for them <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  what are they in this pit o wondrous thing  
    how easily murder is discovered
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  high emperor upon my feeble knee
    i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
    that this fell fault of my accursed sons
    accursed if the fault be provd in them
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  if it be provd you see it is apparent <SENTENCE-END> 
    who found this letter tamora was it you
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  andronicus himself did take it up <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  i did my lord yet let me be their bail
    for by my fathers reverend tomb i vow
    they shall be ready at your highness will
    to answer their suspicion with their lives <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me <SENTENCE-END> 
    some bring the murdered body some the murderers
    let them not speak a word the guilt is plain
    for by my soul were there worse end than death
    that end upon them should be executed <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  andronicus i will entreat the king <SENTENCE-END> 
    fear not thy sons they shall do well enough <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  come lucius come stay not to talk with them <SENTENCE-END>      exeunt




scene iv <SENTENCE-END> 
another part of the forest

enter the empress sons demetrius and chiron with lavinia
her hands cut off and her tongue cut out and ravishd

  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
    who twas that cut thy tongue and ravishd thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
    an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  go home call for sweet water wash thy hands <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
    and so lets leave her to her silent walks <SENTENCE-END> 
  chiron <SENTENCE-END>  an twere my cause i should go hang myself <SENTENCE-END> 
  demetrius <SENTENCE-END>  if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord <SENTENCE-END> 
                                     exeunt demetrius and chiron

           wind horns <SENTENCE-END>  enter marcus from hunting

  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  who is this my niece that flies away so fast  
    cousin a word where is your husband
    if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me
    if i do wake some planet strike me down
    that i may slumber an eternal sleep
    speak gentle niece <SENTENCE-END>  what stern ungentle hands
    hath loppd and hewd and made thy body bare
    of her two branches those sweet ornaments
    whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
    and might not gain so great a happiness
    as half thy love why dost not speak to me
    alas a crimson river of warm blood
    like to a bubbling fountain stirrd with wind
    doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
    coming and going with thy honey breath <SENTENCE-END> 
    but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee
    and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
    ah now thou turnst away thy face for shame
    and notwithstanding all this loss of blood
    as from a conduit with three issuing spouts
    yet do thy cheeks look red as titans face  
    blushing to be encountred with a cloud <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall i speak for thee shall i say tis so
    o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast
    that i might rail at him to ease my mind
    sorrow concealed like an oven stoppd
    doth burn the heart to cinders where it is <SENTENCE-END> 
    fair philomel why she but lost her tongue
    and in a tedious sampler sewd her mind
    but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met
    and he hath cut those pretty fingers off
    that could have better sewd than philomel <SENTENCE-END> 
    o had the monster seen those lily hands
    tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    and make the silken strings delight to kiss them
    he would not then have touchd them for his life
    or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    which that sweet tongue hath made
    he would have droppd his knife and fell asleep
    as cerberus at the thracian poets feet <SENTENCE-END>   
    come let us go and make thy father blind
    for such a sight will blind a fathers eye
    one hours storm will drown the fragrant meads
    what will whole months of tears thy fathers eyes
    do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
    o could our mourning case thy misery                exeunt

act iii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
rome <SENTENCE-END>  a street

enter the judges tribunes and senators with titus two sons
martius and quintus bound passing on the stage to the place of execution
and titus going before pleading

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
    for pity of mine age whose youth was spent
    in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
    for all my blood in romes great quarrel shed
    for all the frosty nights that i have watchd
    and for these bitter tears which now you see
    filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
    be pitiful to my condemned sons
    whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought <SENTENCE-END> 
    for two and twenty sons i never wept
    because they died in honours lofty bed <SENTENCE-END> 
                          andronicus lieth down and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners and exeunt
    for these tribunes in the dust i write  
    my hearts deep languor and my souls sad tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    let my tears stanch the earths dry appetite
    my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush <SENTENCE-END> 
    o earth i will befriend thee more with rain
    that shall distil from these two ancient urns
    than youthful april shall with all his showrs <SENTENCE-END> 
    in summers drought ill drop upon thee still
    in winter with warm tears ill melt the snow
    and keep eternal springtime on thy face
    so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood <SENTENCE-END> 

             enter lucius with his weapon drawn

    o reverend tribunes o gentle aged men
    unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
    and let me say that never wept before
    my tears are now prevailing orators <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  o noble father you lament in vain
    the tribunes hear you not no man is by
    and you recount your sorrows to a stone <SENTENCE-END>   
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead
    grave tribunes once more i entreat of you <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  why tis no matter man if they did hear
    they would not mark me if they did mark
    they would not pity me yet plead i must
    and bootless unto them <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones
    who though they cannot answer my distress
    yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes
    for that they will not intercept my tale <SENTENCE-END> 
    when i do weep they humbly at my feet
    receive my tears and seem to weep with me
    and were they but attired in grave weeds
    rome could afford no tribunes like to these <SENTENCE-END> 
    a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones <SENTENCE-END> 
    a stone is silent and offendeth not
    and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                         rises
    but wherefore standst thou with thy weapon drawn  
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  to rescue my two brothers from their death
    for which attempt the judges have pronouncd
    my everlasting doom of banishment <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  o happy man they have befriended thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive
    that rome is but a wilderness of tigers
    tigers must prey and rome affords no prey
    but me and mine how happy art thou then
    from these devourers to be banished
    but who comes with our brother marcus here

                 enter marcus with lavinia

  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
    or if not so thy noble heart to break <SENTENCE-END> 
    i bring consuming sorrow to thine age <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  will it consume me let me see it then <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  this was thy daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  why marcus so she is <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  ay me this object kills me <SENTENCE-END>   
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  fainthearted boy arise and look upon her <SENTENCE-END> 
    speak lavinia what accursed hand
    hath made thee handless in thy fathers sight
    what fool hath added water to the sea
    or brought a fagot to brightburning troy
    my grief was at the height before thou camst
    and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds <SENTENCE-END> 
    give me a sword ill chop off my hands too
    for they have fought for rome and all in vain
    and they have nursd this woe in feeding life
    in bootless prayer have they been held up
    and they have servd me to effectless use <SENTENCE-END> 
    now all the service i require of them
    is that the one will help to cut the other <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands
    for hands to do rome service is but vain <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  speak gentle sister who hath martyrd thee
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  o that delightful engine of her thoughts
    that blabbd them with such pleasing eloquence
    is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage  
    where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
    sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  o say thou for her who hath done this deed
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  o thus i found her straying in the park
    seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
    that hath receivd some unrecuring wound <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  it was my dear and he that wounded her
    hath hurt me more than had he killd me dead
    for now i stand as one upon a rock
    environd with a wilderness of sea
    who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
    expecting ever when some envious surge
    will in his brinish bowels swallow him <SENTENCE-END> 
    this way to death my wretched sons are gone
    here stands my other son a banishd man
    and here my brother weeping at my woes <SENTENCE-END> 
    but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
    is dear lavinia dearer than my soul <SENTENCE-END> 
    had i but seen thy picture in this plight
    it would have madded me what shall i do  
    now i behold thy lively body so
    thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
    nor tongue to tell me who hath martyrd thee
    thy husband he is dead and for his death
    thy brothers are condemnd and dead by this <SENTENCE-END> 
    look marcus ah son lucius look on her
    when i did name her brothers then fresh tears
    stood on her cheeks as doth the honey dew
    upon a gathred lily almost withered <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  perchance she weeps because they killd her husband
    perchance because she knows them innocent <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  if they did kill thy husband then be joyful
    because the law hath taen revenge on them <SENTENCE-END> 
    no no they would not do so foul a deed
    witness the sorrow that their sister makes <SENTENCE-END> 
    gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips
    or make some sign how i may do thee ease <SENTENCE-END> 
    shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius
    and thou and i sit round about some fountain
    looking all downwards to behold our cheeks  
    how they are staind like meadows yet not dry
    with miry slime left on them by a flood
    and in the fountain shall we gaze so long
    till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
    and made a brinepit with our bitter tears
    or shall we cut away our hands like thine
    or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
    pass the remainder of our hateful days
    what shall we do let us that have our tongues
    plot some device of further misery
    to make us wonderd at in time to come <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
    see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  patience dear niece <SENTENCE-END>  good titus dry thine eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  ah marcus marcus brother well i wot
    thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
    for thou poor man hast drownd it with thine own <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  ah my lavinia i will wipe thy cheeks <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  mark marcus mark i understand her signs <SENTENCE-END> 
    had she a tongue to speak now would she say  
    that to her brother which i said to thee
    his napkin with his true tears all bewet
    can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks <SENTENCE-END> 
    o what a sympathy of woe is this
    as far from help as limbo is from bliss

                   enter aaron the moor

  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  titus andronicus my lord the emperor
    sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons

    and that shall be the ransom for their fault <SENTENCE-END>

    and therefore mine shall save my brothers lives <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  which of your hands hath not defended rome
    and reard aloft the bloody battleaxe
    writing destruction on the enemys castle
    o none of both but are of high desert

    to ransom my two nephews from their death
    then have i kept it to a worthy end <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  nay come agree whose hand shall go along
    for fear they die before their pardon come <SENTENCE-END>

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  sirs strive no more such withred herbs as these
    are meet for plucking up and therefore mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  sweet father if i shall be thought thy son

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  agree between you i will spare my hand <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  then ill go fetch an axe <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  but i will use the axe <SENTENCE-END> 
                                        exeunt lucius and marcus
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  come hither aaron ill deceive them both

  aaron <SENTENCE-END>   aside  if that be calld deceit i will be honest
    and never whilst i live deceive men so
    but ill deceive you in another sort
    and that youll say ere half an hour pass <SENTENCE-END> 
                                       he cuts off titus hand

                 reenter lucius and marcus

 titus <SENTENCE-END>  now stay your strife <SENTENCE-END>  what shall be is dispatchd <SENTENCE-END> 
    good aaron give his majesty my hand
    tell him it was a hand that warded him
    from thousand dangers bid him bury it <SENTENCE-END> 
    more hath it merited that let it have <SENTENCE-END>   
    as for my sons say i account of them
    as jewels purchasd at an easy price
    and yet dear too because i bought mine own <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  i go andronicus and for thy hand
    look by and by to have thy sons with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    aside  their heads i mean <SENTENCE-END>  o how this villainy
    doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
    let fools do good and fair men call for grace
    aaron will have his soul black like his face <SENTENCE-END>            exit
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  o here i lift this one hand up to heaven
    and bow this feeble ruin to the earth
    if any power pities wretched tears
    to that i call  to lavinia  what wouldst thou kneel with me
    do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
    or with our sighs well breathe the welkin dim
    and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
    when they do hug him in their melting bosoms <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  o brother speak with possibility
    and do not break into these deep extremes <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  is not my sorrow deep having no bottom  
    then be my passions bottomless with them <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  but yet let reason govern thy lament <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  if there were reason for these miseries
    then into limits could i bind my woes <SENTENCE-END> 
    when heaven doth weep doth not the earth oerflow
    if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
    threatning the welkin with his bigswoln face
    and wilt thou have a reason for this coil
    i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow <SENTENCE-END> 
    she is the weeping welkin i the earth
    then must my sea be moved with her sighs
    then must my earth with her continual tears
    become a deluge overflowd and drownd
    for why my bowels cannot hide her woes
    but like a drunkard must i vomit them <SENTENCE-END> 
    then give me leave for losers will have leave
    to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues <SENTENCE-END> 

        enter a messenger with two heads and a hand
  
  messenger <SENTENCE-END>  worthy andronicus ill art thou repaid
    for that good hand thou sentst the emperor <SENTENCE-END> 
    here are the heads of thy two noble sons
    and heres thy hand in scorn to thee sent back
    thy grief their sports thy resolution mockd
    that woe is me to think upon thy woes
    more than remembrance of my fathers death <SENTENCE-END>              exit
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  now let hot aetna cool in sicily
    and be my heart an everburning hell
    these miseries are more than may be borne <SENTENCE-END> 
    to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
    but sorrow flouted at is double death <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
    and yet detested life not shrink thereat
    that ever death should let life bear his name
    where life hath no more interest but to breathe
                                          lavinia kisses titus
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
    as frozen water to a starved snake <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  when will this fearful slumber have an end  
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  now farewell flattry die andronicus <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou dost not slumber see thy two sons heads

    even like a stony image cold and numb <SENTENCE-END> 
    ah now no more will i control thy griefs <SENTENCE-END> 
    rent off thy silver hair thy other hand
    gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
    the closing up of our most wretched eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    now is a time to storm why art thou still
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  ha ha ha
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  why dost thou laugh it fits not with this hour <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  why i have not another tear to shed
    besides this sorrow is an enemy
    and would usurp upon my watry eyes
    and make them blind with tributary tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    then which way shall i find revenges cave
    for these two heads do seem to speak to me
    and threat me i shall never come to bliss  
    till all these mischiefs be returnd again
    even in their throats that have committed them <SENTENCE-END> 
    come let me see what task i have to do <SENTENCE-END> 
    you heavy people circle me about
    that i may turn me to each one of you
    and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs <SENTENCE-END> 
    the vow is made <SENTENCE-END>  come brother take a head
    and in this hand the other will i bear <SENTENCE-END>

    as for thee boy go get thee from my sight
    thou art an exile and thou must not stay <SENTENCE-END> 
    hie to the goths and raise an army there
    and if ye love me as i think you do

    he leaves his pledges dearer than his life <SENTENCE-END>   
    farewell lavinia my noble sister
    o would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
    but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives
    but in oblivion and hateful griefs <SENTENCE-END> 
    if lucius live he will requite your wrongs
    and make proud saturnine and his emperess
    beg at the gates like tarquin and his queen <SENTENCE-END> 
    now will i to the goths and raise a powr
    to be revengd on rome and saturnine <SENTENCE-END>                    exit

    thou canst not strike it thus to make it still <SENTENCE-END>

    lest we remember still that we have none <SENTENCE-END>

    speechless complainer i will learn thy thought
    in thy dumb action will i be as perfect
    as begging hermits in their holy prayers <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
    nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
    but i of these will wrest an alphabet
    and by still practice learn to know thy meaning <SENTENCE-END>

  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus  
  boy <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i know not i nor can i guess

    why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  i think she means that there were more than one
    confederate in the fact ay more there was
    or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  lucius what book is that she tosseth so

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  soft so busily she turns the leaves help her <SENTENCE-END> 
    what would she find lavinia shall i read
    this is the tragic tale of philomel
    and treats of tereus treason and his rape
    and rape i fear was root of thy annoy <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  see brother see note how she quotes the leaves <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  lavinia wert thou thus surprisd sweet girl
    ravishd and wrongd as philomela was
    forcd in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods  
    see see
    ay such a place there is where we did hunt
    o had we never never hunted there
    patternd by that the poet here describes
    by nature made for murders and for rapes <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  o why should nature build so foul a den
    unless the gods delight in tragedies
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends
    what roman lord it was durst do the deed <SENTENCE-END> 
    or slunk not saturnine as tarquin erst
    that left the camp to sin in lucrece bed

    apollo pallas jove or mercury
    inspire me that i may this treason find
    my lord look here look here lavinia

    tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  o calm thee gentle lord although i know
    there is enough written upon this earth
    to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
    and arm the minds of infants to exclaims <SENTENCE-END>

    and kneel sweet boy the roman hectors hope
    and swear with me as with the woeful fere  
    and father of that chaste dishonoured dame

    mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths
    and see their blood or die with this reproach <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  tis sure enough an you knew how
    but if you hunt these bearwhelps then beware
    the dam will wake and if she wind ye once

    and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
    and when he sleeps will she do what she list <SENTENCE-END> 
    you are a young huntsman marcus let alone
    and come i will go get a leaf of brass
    and with a gad of steel will write these words
    and lay it by <SENTENCE-END>  the angry northern wind

lords and others <SENTENCE-END>  the emperor brings the arrows in his hand that titus
shot at him

  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  why lords what wrongs are these was ever seen
    an emperor in rome thus overborne
    troubled confronted thus and for the extent
    of egal justice usd in such contempt
    my lords you know as know the mightful gods
    however these disturbers of our peace
    buzz in the peoples ears there nought hath passd
    but even with law against the wilful sons
    of old andronicus <SENTENCE-END>  and what an if
    his sorrows have so overwhelmd his wits
    shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
    his fits his frenzy and his bitterness
    and now he writes to heaven for his redress <SENTENCE-END> 
    see heres to jove and this to mercury
    this to apollo this to the god of war  
    sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome
    whats this but libelling against the senate
    and blazoning our unjustice every where
    a goodly humour is it not my lords
    as who would say in rome no justice were <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if i live his feigned ecstasies
    shall be no shelter to these outrages
    but he and his shall know that justice lives
    in saturninus health whom if she sleep
    hell so awake as he in fury shall
    cut off the proudst conspirator that lives <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious lord my lovely saturnine
    lord of my life commander of my thoughts
    calm thee and bear the faults of titus age
    th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons
    whose loss hath piercd him deep and scarrd his heart
    and rather comfort his distressed plight
    than prosecute the meanest or the best
    for these contempts <SENTENCE-END>   aside  why thus it shall become
    highwitted tamora to gloze with all <SENTENCE-END>   
    but titus i have touchd thee to the quick
    thy lifeblood out if aaron now be wise
    then is all safe the anchor in the port <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter clown

    how now good fellow wouldst thou speak with us
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  yes forsooth an your mistriship be emperial <SENTENCE-END>

    end <SENTENCE-END>                                           exit guarded
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  despiteful and intolerable wrongs
    shall i endure this monstrous villainy
    i know from whence this same device proceeds <SENTENCE-END>   
    may this be borne as if his traitorous sons
    that died by law for murder of our brother
    have by my means been butchered wrongfully
    go drag the villain hither by the hair
    nor age nor honour shall shape privilege <SENTENCE-END> 
    for this proud mock ill be thy slaughterman
    sly frantic wretch that holpst to make me great
    in hope thyself should govern rome and me <SENTENCE-END> 

                   enter nuntius aemilius

    what news with thee aemilius
  aemilius <SENTENCE-END>  arm my lords rome never had more cause <SENTENCE-END> 
    the goths have gathered head and with a power
    of high resolved men bent to the spoil
    they hither march amain under conduct
    of lucius son to old andronicus
    who threats in course of this revenge to do
    as much as ever coriolanus did <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  is warlike lucius general of the goths  
    these tidings nip me and i hang the head
    as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms <SENTENCE-END> 
    ay now begins our sorrows to approach <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis he the common people love so much
    myself hath often heard them say
    when i have walked like a private man
    that lucius banishment was wrongfully
    and they have wishd that lucius were their emperor <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  why should you fear is not your city strong
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  ay but the citizens favour lucius
    and will revolt from me to succour him <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
    is the sun dimmd that gnats do fly in it
    the eagle suffers little birds to sing
    and is not careful what they mean thereby
    knowing that with the shadow of his wings
    he can at pleasure stint their melody
    even so mayest thou the giddy men of rome <SENTENCE-END> 
    then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor
    i will enchant the old andronicus  
    with words more sweet and yet more dangerous
    than baits to fish or honeystalks to sheep
    when as the one is wounded with the bait
    the other rotted with delicious feed <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  but he will not entreat his son for us <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  if tamora entreat him then he will
    for i can smooth and fill his aged ears
    with golden promises that were his heart
    almost impregnable his old ears deaf
    yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue <SENTENCE-END> 
    to aemilius  go thou before to be our ambassador
    say that the emperor requests a parley
    of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting
    even at his fathers house the old andronicus <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  aemilius do this message honourably
    and if he stand on hostage for his safety
    bid him demand what pledge will please him best <SENTENCE-END> 
  aemilius <SENTENCE-END>  your bidding shall i do effectually <SENTENCE-END>             exit
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  now will i to that old andronicus
    and temper him with all the art i have  
    to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths <SENTENCE-END> 
    and now sweet emperor be blithe again
    and bury all thy fear in my devices <SENTENCE-END> 
  saturninus <SENTENCE-END>  then go successantly and plead to him <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                          exeunt

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
plains near rome

enter lucius with an army of goths with drums and colours

  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  approved warriors and my faithful friends
    i have received letters from great rome
    which signifies what hate they bear their emperor
    and how desirous of our sight they are <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore great lords be as your titles witness
    imperious and impatient of your wrongs
    and wherein rome hath done you any scath
    let him make treble satisfaction <SENTENCE-END> 
  first goth <SENTENCE-END>  brave slip sprung from the great andronicus
    whose name was once our terror now our comfort
    whose high exploits and honourable deeds
    ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt
    be bold in us well follow where thou leadst
    like stinging bees in hottest summers day
    led by their master to the flowred fields
    and be avengd on cursed tamora <SENTENCE-END>   
  all the goths <SENTENCE-END>  and as he saith so say we all with him <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  i humbly thank him and i thank you all <SENTENCE-END> 
    but who comes here led by a lusty goth

     enter a goth leading aaron with his child in his arms

  second goth <SENTENCE-END>  renowned lucius from our troops i strayd
    to gaze upon a ruinous monastery
    and as i earnestly did fix mine eye
    upon the wasted building suddenly
    i heard a child cry underneath a wall <SENTENCE-END> 
    i made unto the noise when soon i heard
    the crying babe controlld with this discourse
    peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
    did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
    had nature lent thee but thy mothers look
    villain thou mightst have been an emperor
    but where the bull and cow are both milkwhite
    they never do beget a coalblack calf <SENTENCE-END> 
    peace villain peace even thus he rates the babe  
    for i must bear thee to a trusty goth
    who when he knows thou art the empress babe
    will hold thee dearly for thy mothers sake <SENTENCE-END> 
    with this my weapon drawn i rushd upon him
    surprisd him suddenly and brought him hither
    to use as you think needful of the man <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil
    that robbd andronicus of his good hand
    this is the pearl that pleasd your empress eye
    and heres the base fruit of her burning lust <SENTENCE-END> 
    say walleyd slave whither wouldst thou convey
    this growing image of thy fiendlike face
    why dost not speak what deaf not a word
    a halter soldiers hang him on this tree
    and by his side his fruit of bastardy <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  touch not the boy he is of royal blood <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  too like the sire for ever being good <SENTENCE-END> 
    first hang the child that he may see it sprawl
    a sight to vex the fathers soul withal <SENTENCE-END> 
    get me a ladder <SENTENCE-END>   
                a ladder brought which aaron is made to climb
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  lucius save the child
    and bear it from me to the emperess <SENTENCE-END> 
    if thou do this ill show thee wondrous things
    that highly may advantage thee to hear
    if thou wilt not befall what may befall
    ill speak no more but vengeance rot you all
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  say on an if it please me which thou speakst
    thy child shall live and i will see it nourishd <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  an if it please thee why assure thee lucius
    twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak
    for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres
    acts of black night abominable deeds
    complots of mischief treason villainies
    ruthful to hear yet piteously performd
    and this shall all be buried in my death
    unless thou swear to me my child shall live <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  swear that he shall and then i will begin <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  who should i swear by thou believest no god  
    that granted how canst thou believe an oath
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  what if i do not as indeed i do not
    yet for i know thou art religious
    and hast a thing within thee called conscience
    with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
    which i have seen thee careful to observe
    therefore i urge thy oath <SENTENCE-END>  for that i know
    an idiot holds his bauble for a god
    and keeps the oath which by that god he swears
    to that ill urge him <SENTENCE-END>  therefore thou shalt vow
    by that same god what god soeer it be
    that thou adorest and hast in reverence
    to save my boy to nourish and bring him up
    or else i will discover nought to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  even by my god i swear to thee i will <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  first know thou i begot him on the empress <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  o most insatiate and luxurious woman
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  tut lucius this was but a deed of charity
    to that which thou shalt hear of me anon <SENTENCE-END> 
    twas her two sons that murdered bassianus  
    they cut thy sisters tongue and ravishd her
    and cut her hands and trimmd her as thou sawest <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  o detestable villain callst thou that trimming
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  why she was washd and cut and trimmd and twas
    trim sport for them which had the doing of it <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  o barbarous beastly villains like thyself
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  indeed i was their tutor to instruct them <SENTENCE-END> 
    that codding spirit had they from their mother
    as sure a card as ever won the set
    that bloody mind i think they learnd of me
    as true a dog as ever fought at head <SENTENCE-END> 
    well let my deeds be witness of my worth <SENTENCE-END> 
    i traind thy brethren to that guileful hole
    where the dead corpse of bassianus lay
    i wrote the letter that thy father found
    and hid the gold within that letter mentiond
    confederate with the queen and her two sons
    and what not done that thou hast cause to rue
    wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it
    i playd the cheater for thy fathers hand  
    and when i had it drew myself apart
    and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter <SENTENCE-END> 
    i pried me through the crevice of a wall
    when for his hand he had his two sons heads
    beheld his tears and laughd so heartily
    that both mine eyes were rainy like to his
    and when i told the empress of this sport
    she swooned almost at my pleasing tale
    and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses <SENTENCE-END> 
  goth <SENTENCE-END>  what canst thou say all this and never blush
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  ay like a black dog as the saying is <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  ay that i had not done a thousand more <SENTENCE-END> 
    even now i curse the day and yet i think
    few come within the compass of my curse
    wherein i did not some notorious ill
    as kill a man or else devise his death
    ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
    accuse some innocent and forswear myself
    set deadly enmity between two friends  
    make poor mens cattle break their necks
    set fire on barns and haystacks in the night
    and bid the owners quench them with their tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    oft have i diggd up dead men from their graves
    and set them upright at their dear friends door
    even when their sorrows almost was forgot
    and on their skins as on the bark of trees
    have with my knife carved in roman letters
    let not your sorrow die though i am dead <SENTENCE-END> 
    tut i have done a thousand dreadful things
    as willingly as one would kill a fly
    and nothing grieves me heartily indeed
    but that i cannot do ten thousand more <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  bring down the devil for he must not die
    so sweet a death as hanging presently <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  if there be devils would i were a devil
    to live and burn in everlasting fire
    so i might have your company in hell
    but to torment you with my bitter tongue
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more <SENTENCE-END>   

                       enter aemilius

  goth <SENTENCE-END>  my lord there is a messenger from rome
    desires to be admitted to your presence <SENTENCE-END>

    welcome aemilius <SENTENCE-END>  whats the news from rome
  aemilius <SENTENCE-END>  lord lucius and you princes of the goths
    the roman emperor greets you all by me
    and for he understands you are in arms
    he craves a parley at your fathers house
    willing you to demand your hostages
    and they shall be immediately deliverd <SENTENCE-END> 
  first goth <SENTENCE-END>  what says our general
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  aemilius let the emperor give his pledges
    unto my father and my uncle marcus <SENTENCE-END>

    i will encounter with andronicus
    and say i am revenge sent from below
    to join with him and right his heinous wrongs <SENTENCE-END> 
    knock at his study where they say he keeps
    to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
    tell him revenge is come to join with him
    and work confusion on his enemies <SENTENCE-END> 

         they knock and titus opens his study door above

  titus <SENTENCE-END>  who doth molest my contemplation
    is it your trick to make me ope the door
    that so my sad decrees may fly away
    and all my study be to no effect
    you are deceivd for what i mean to do  
    see here in bloody lines i have set down
    and what is written shall be executed <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  titus i am come to talk with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  no not a word <SENTENCE-END>  how can i grace my talk
    wanting a hand to give it that accord
    thou hast the odds of me therefore no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  if thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  i am not mad i know thee well enough
    witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
    witness these trenches made by grief and care
    witness the tiring day and heavy night
    witness all sorrow that i know thee well
    for our proud empress mighty tamora <SENTENCE-END> 
    is not thy coming for my other hand
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  know thou sad man i am not tamora
    she is thy enemy and i thy friend <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am revenge sent from th infernal kingdom
    to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
    by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes <SENTENCE-END> 
    come down and welcome me to this worlds light  
    confer with me of murder and of death
    theres not a hollow cave or lurkingplace
    no vast obscurity or misty vale
    where bloody murder or detested rape
    can couch for fear but i will find them out
    and in their ears tell them my dreadful name
    revenge which makes the foul offender quake <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  art thou revenge and art thou sent to me
    to be a torment to mine enemies
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  i am therefore come down and welcome me <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  do me some service ere i come to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    lo by thy side where rape and murder stands
    now give some surance that thou art revenge
    stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels
    and then ill come and be thy waggoner
    and whirl along with thee about the globes <SENTENCE-END> 
    provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
    to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
    and find out murderers in their guilty caves
    and when thy car is loaden with their heads  
    i will dismount and by thy waggon wheel
    trot like a servile footman all day long
    even from hyperions rising in the east
    until his very downfall in the sea <SENTENCE-END> 
    and day by day ill do this heavy task
    so thou destroy rapine and murder there <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  these are my ministers and come with me <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  are they thy ministers what are they calld
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  rape and murder therefore called so
    cause they take vengeance of such kind of men <SENTENCE-END> 
  titus <SENTENCE-END>  good lord how like the empress sons they are
    and you the empress but we worldly men
    have miserable mad mistaking eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
    o sweet revenge now do i come to thee
    and if one arms embracement will content thee
    i will embrace thee in it by and by <SENTENCE-END> 
  tamora <SENTENCE-END>  this closing with him fits his lunacy <SENTENCE-END> 
    whateer i forge to feed his brainsick humours
    do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
    for now he firmly takes me for revenge  
    and being credulous in this mad thought
    ill make him send for lucius his son
    and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure
    ill find some cunning practice out of hand
    to scatter and disperse the giddy goths
    or at the least make them his enemies <SENTENCE-END> 
    see here he comes and i must ply my theme <SENTENCE-END> 

                 enter titus below

  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  you sadfacd men people and sons of rome
    by uproars severd as a flight of fowl
    scatterd by winds and high tempestuous gusts
    o let me teach you how to knit again
    this scattered corn into one mutual sheaf
    these broken limbs again into one body
    lest rome herself be bane unto herself
    and she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to
    like a forlorn and desperate castaway
    do shameful execution on herself <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if my frosty signs and chaps of age
    grave witnesses of true experience
    cannot induce you to attend my words
    to lucius  speak romes dear friend as erst our ancestor  
    when with his solemn tongue he did discourse
    to lovesick didos sad attending ear
    the story of that baleful burning night
    when subtle greeks surprisd king priams troy <SENTENCE-END> 
    tell us what sinon hath bewitchd our ears
    or who hath brought the fatal engine in
    that gives our troy our rome the civil wound <SENTENCE-END> 
    my heart is not compact of flint nor steel
    nor can i utter all our bitter grief
    but floods of tears will drown my oratory
    and break my uttrance even in the time
    when it should move ye to attend me most
    and force you to commiseration <SENTENCE-END> 
    heres romes young captain let him tell the tale
    while i stand by and weep to hear him speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  then gracious auditory be it known to you
    that chiron and the damnd demetrius
    were they that murdred our emperors brother
    and they it were that ravished our sister <SENTENCE-END> 
    for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded  
    our fathers tears despisd and basely cozend
    of that true hand that fought romes quarrel out
    and sent her enemies unto the grave <SENTENCE-END> 
    lastly myself unkindly banished
    the gates shut on me and turnd weeping out
    to beg relief among romes enemies
    who drownd their enmity in my true tears
    and opd their arms to embrace me as a friend <SENTENCE-END> 
    i am the turned forth be it known to you
    that have preservd her welfare in my blood
    and from her bosom took the enemys point
    sheathing the steel in my adventrous body <SENTENCE-END> 
    alas you know i am no vaunter i
    my scars can witness dumb although they are
    that my report is just and full of truth <SENTENCE-END> 
    but soft methinks i do digress too much
    citing my worthless praise <SENTENCE-END>  o pardon me
    for when no friends are by men praise themselves <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  now is my turn to speak <SENTENCE-END>  behold the child <SENTENCE-END> 
                  pointing to the child in an attendants arms  
    of this was tamora delivered
    the issue of an irreligious moor
    chief architect and plotter of these woes <SENTENCE-END> 
    the villain is alive in titus house
    damnd as he is to witness this is true <SENTENCE-END> 
    now judge what cause had titus to revenge
    these wrongs unspeakable past patience
    or more than any living man could bear <SENTENCE-END> 
    now have you heard the truth what say you romans
    have we done aught amiss show us wherein
    and from the place where you behold us pleading
    the poor remainder of andronici
    will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves
    and on the ragged stones beat forth our souls
    and make a mutual closure of our house <SENTENCE-END> 
    speak romans speak and if you say we shall
    lo hand in hand lucius and i will fall <SENTENCE-END> 
  aemilius <SENTENCE-END>  come come thou reverend man of rome
    and bring our emperor gently in thy hand
    lucius our emperor for well i know  
    the common voice do cry it shall be so <SENTENCE-END> 
  all <SENTENCE-END>  lucius all hail romes royal emperor
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  go go into old titus sorrowful house
    and hither hale that misbelieving moor
    to be adjudgd some direful slaughtring death
    as punishment for his most wicked life <SENTENCE-END>           exeunt some
              attendants <SENTENCE-END>  lucius marcus and the others descend
  all <SENTENCE-END>  lucius all hail romes gracious governor
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  thanks gentle romans may i govern so
    to heal romes harms and wipe away her woe
    but gentle people give me aim awhile
    for nature puts me to a heavy task <SENTENCE-END> 
    stand all aloof but uncle draw you near
    to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk <SENTENCE-END> 
    o take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips <SENTENCE-END>   kisses titus
    these sorrowful drops upon thy bloodstaind face
    the last true duties of thy noble son
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss

    o were the sum of these that i should pay  
    countless and infinite yet would i pay them
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  come hither boy come come come and learn of us
    to melt in showers <SENTENCE-END>  thy grandsire lovd thee well
    many a time he dancd thee on his knee
    sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
    many a story hath he told to thee
    and bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
    and talk of them when he was dead and gone <SENTENCE-END> 
  marcus <SENTENCE-END>  how many thousand times hath these poor lips
    when they were living warmd themselves on thine

    give sentence on the execrable wretch
    that hath been breeder of these dire events <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  set him breastdeep in earth and famish him
    there let him stand and rave and cry for food <SENTENCE-END> 
    if any one relieves or pities him
    for the offence he dies <SENTENCE-END>  this is our doom <SENTENCE-END> 
    some stay to see him fastned in the earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  aaron <SENTENCE-END>  ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
    i am no baby i that with base prayers
    i should repent the evils i have done
    ten thousand worse than ever yet i did
    would i perform if i might have my will <SENTENCE-END> 
    if one good deed in all my life i did
    i do repent it from my very soul <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucius <SENTENCE-END>  some loving friends convey the emperor hence
    and give him burial in his fathers grave <SENTENCE-END> 
    my father and lavinia shall forthwith
    be closed in our households monument <SENTENCE-END> 
    as for that ravenous tiger tamora  
    no funeral rite nor man in mourning weed
    no mournful bell shall ring her burial
    but throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey <SENTENCE-END> 
    her life was beastly and devoid of pity
    and being dead let birds on her take pity <SENTENCE-END>            exeunt

enter troilus armed and pandarus

  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  call here my varlet ill unarm again <SENTENCE-END> 
    why should i war without the walls of troy
    that find such cruel battle here within
    each troyan that is master of his heart
    let him to field troilus alas hath none
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  will this gear neer be mended
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
    fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
    but i am weaker than a womans tear
    tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
    less valiant than the virgin in the night
    and skilless as unpractisd infancy <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  well i have told you enough of this for my part
    ill not meddle nor make no farther <SENTENCE-END>  he that will have a cake
    out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  have i not tarried
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting <SENTENCE-END>   
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  have i not tarried
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  still have i tarried <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  ay to the leavening but heres yet in the word
    hereafter the kneading the making of the cake the heating
    of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too
    or you may chance to burn your lips <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  patience herself what goddess eer she be
    doth lesser blench at suffrance than i do <SENTENCE-END> 
    at priams royal table do i sit
    and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts
    so traitor then she comes when she is thence <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  well she lookd yesternight fairer than ever i saw her
    look or any woman else <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  i was about to tell thee when my heart
    as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
    lest hector or my father should perceive me
    i have as when the sun doth light a storm
    buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile <SENTENCE-END> 
    but sorrow that is couchd in seeming gladness  
    is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  an her hair were not somewhat darker than helens well
    go to there were no more comparison between the women <SENTENCE-END>  but for
    my part she is my kinswoman i would not as they term it
    praise her but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as
    i did <SENTENCE-END>  i  will not dispraise your sister cassandras wit but
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  o pandarus i tell thee pandarus
    when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drownd
    reply not in how many fathoms deep
    they lie indrenchd <SENTENCE-END>  i tell thee i am mad
    in cressids love <SENTENCE-END>  thou answerst she is fair
    pourest in the open ulcer of my heart
    her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
    handlest in thy discourse <SENTENCE-END>  o that her hand
    in whose comparison all whites are ink
    writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
    the cygnets down is harsh and spirit of sense
    hard as the palm of ploughman this thou tellst me
    as true thou tellst me when i say i love her
    but saying thus instead of oil and balm  
    thou layst in every gash that love hath given me
    the knife that made it <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  i speak no more than truth <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost not speak so much <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  faith ill not meddle in it <SENTENCE-END>  let her be as she is if
    she be fair tis the better for her an she be not she has the
    mends in her own hands <SENTENCE-END>

  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  tis just to each of them he is himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  himself alas poor troilus i would he were
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  so he is <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  condition i had gone barefoot to india <SENTENCE-END>

  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  he is elder <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me pardon me <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  th others not come tot you shall tell me another tale
    when th others come tot <SENTENCE-END>  hector shall not have his wit this
    year <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  he shall not need it if he have his own <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  nor his qualities <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  no matter <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  nor his beauty <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  twould not become him his owns better <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  you have no judgment niece <SENTENCE-END>  helen herself swore th
    other day that troilus for a brown favour for so tis i must
    confess not brown neither
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  no but brown <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  faith to say truth brown and not brown <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  to say the truth true and not true <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  she praisd his complexion above paris <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  why paris hath colour enough <SENTENCE-END>   
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  so he has <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  then troilus should have too much <SENTENCE-END>  if she praisd him
    above his complexion is higher than his he having colour
    enough and the other higher is too flaming praise for a good
    complexion <SENTENCE-END>  i had as lief helens golden tongue had commended
    troilus for a copper nose <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  then shes a merry greek indeed <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  nay i am sure she does <SENTENCE-END>  she came to him th other day
    into the compassd windowand you know he has not past three or
    four hairs on his chin
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  why he is very young and yet will he within three pound
    lift as much as his brother hector <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  is he so young a man and so old a lifter
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  juno have mercy how came it cloven
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  why you know tis dimpled <SENTENCE-END>  i think his smiling becomes  
    him better than any man in all phrygia <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  o he smiles valiantly
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  does he not
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  o yes an twere a cloud in autumn
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  why go to then but to prove to you that helen loves
    troilus
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  troilus will stand to the proof if youll prove it so <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  troilus why he esteems her no more than i esteem an
    addle egg <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head you would eat chickens i th shell <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
    chin <SENTENCE-END>  indeed she has a marvells white hand i must needs
    confess <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  without the rack <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  alas poor chin many a wart is richer <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  but there was such laughing queen hecuba laughd that
    her eyes ran oer <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  with millstones <SENTENCE-END>   
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  and cassandra laughd <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes <SENTENCE-END>  did her eyes run oer too
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  and hector laughd <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  at what was all this laughing
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus
    chin <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  ant had been a green hair i should have laughd too <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  they laughd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  what was his answer
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  quoth she heres but two and fifty hairs on your chin
    and one of them is white <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  this is her question <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  thats true make no question of that <SENTENCE-END>  two and fifty
    hairs quoth he and one white <SENTENCE-END>  that white hair is my father
    and all the rest are his sons <SENTENCE-END>  jupiter quoth she which of
    these hairs is paris my husband the forked one quoth he
    pluckt out and give it him <SENTENCE-END>  but there was such laughing and
    helen so blushd and paris so chafd and all the rest so  
    laughd that it passd <SENTENCE-END>

act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene 3 <SENTENCE-END> 
the grecian camp <SENTENCE-END>  before agamemnons tent

sennet <SENTENCE-END>  enter agamemnon nestor ulysses diomedes menelaus and others

  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  princes
    what grief hath set these jaundies oer your cheeks
    the ample proposition that hope makes
    in all designs begun on earth below
    fails in the promisd largeness checks and disasters
    grow in the veins of actions highest reard
    as knots by the conflux of meeting sap
    infects the sound pine and diverts his grain
    tortive and errant from his course of growth <SENTENCE-END> 
    nor princes is it matter new to us
    that we come short of our suppose so far
    that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand
    sith every action that hath gone before
    whereof we have record trial did draw
    bias and thwart not answering the aim
    and that unbodied figure of the thought  
    that gavet surmised shape <SENTENCE-END>  why then you princes
    do you with cheeks abashd behold our works
    and call them shames which are indeed nought else
    but the protractive trials of great jove
    to find persistive constancy in men
    the fineness of which metal is not found
    in fortunes love for then the bold and coward
    the wise and fool the artist and unread
    the hard and soft seem all affind and kin <SENTENCE-END> 
    but in the wind and tempest of her frown
    distinction with a broad and powerful fan
    puffing at all winnows the light away
    and what hath mass or matter by itself
    lies rich in virtue and unmingled <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  with due observance of thy godlike seat
    great agamemnon nestor shall apply
    thy latest words <SENTENCE-END>  in the reproof of chance
    lies the true proof of men <SENTENCE-END>  the sea being smooth
    how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
    upon her patient breast making their way  
    with those of nobler bulk
    but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
    the gentle thetis and anon behold
    the strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut
    bounding between the two moist elements
    like perseus horse <SENTENCE-END>  wheres then the saucy boat
    whose weak untimberd sides but even now
    corivalld greatness either to harbour fled
    or made a toast for neptune <SENTENCE-END>  even so
    doth valours show and valours worth divide
    in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
    the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
    than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
    makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
    and flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage
    as rousd with rage with rage doth sympathise
    and with an accent tund in selfsame key
    retorts to chiding fortune <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  agamemnon
    thou great commander nerve and bone of greece  
    heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
    in whom the tempers and the minds of all
    should be shut uphear what ulysses speaks <SENTENCE-END> 
    besides the applause and approbation
    the which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway
    to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life
    i give to both your speeches which were such
    as agamemnon and the hand of greece
    should hold up high in brass and such again
    as venerable nestor hatchd in silver
    should with a bond of air strong as the axletree
    on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears
    to his experiencd tongueyet let it please both
    thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  speak prince of ithaca and bet of less expect
    that matter needless of importless burden
    divide thy lips than we are confident
    when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws
    we shall hear music wit and oracle <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  troy yet upon his basis had been down  
    and the great hectors sword had lackd a master
    but for these instances
    the specialty of rule hath been neglected
    and look how many grecian tents do stand
    hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions <SENTENCE-END> 
    when that the general is not like the hive
    to whom the foragers shall all repair
    what honey is expected degree being vizarded
    th unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask <SENTENCE-END> 
    the heavens themselves the planets and this centre
    observe degree priority and place
    insisture course proportion season form
    office and custom in all line of order
    and therefore is the glorious planet sol
    in noble eminence enthrond and spherd
    amidst the other whose medcinable eye
    corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
    and posts like the commandment of a king
    sans check to good and bad <SENTENCE-END>  but when the planets
    in evil mixture to disorder wander  
    what plagues and what portents what mutiny
    what raging of the sea shaking of earth
    commotion in the winds frights changes horrors
    divert and crack rend and deracinate
    the unity and married calm of states
    quite from their fixture o when degree is shakd
    which is the ladder of all high designs
    the enterprise is sick how could communities
    degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
    peaceful commerce from dividable shores
    the primogenity and due of birth
    prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
    but by degree stand in authentic place
    take but degree away untune that string
    and hark what discord follows each thing melts
    in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
    should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
    and make a sop of all this solid globe
    strength should be lord of imbecility
    and the rude son should strike his father dead  
    force should be right or rather right and wrong
    between whose endless jar justice resides
    should lose their names and so should justice too <SENTENCE-END> 
    then everything includes itself in power
    power into will will into appetite
    and appetite an universal wolf
    so doubly seconded with will and power
    must make perforce an universal prey
    and last eat up himself <SENTENCE-END>  great agamemnon
    this chaos when degree is suffocate
    follows the choking <SENTENCE-END> 
    and this neglection of degree it is
    that by a pace goes backward with a purpose
    it hath to climb <SENTENCE-END>  the generals disdaind
    by him one step below he by the next
    that next by him beneath so ever step
    exampld by the first pace that is sick
    of his superior grows to an envious fever
    of pale and bloodless emulation <SENTENCE-END> 
    and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot  
    not her own sinews <SENTENCE-END>  to end a tale of length
    troy in our weakness stands not in her strength <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  most wisely hath ulysses here discoverd
    the fever whereof all our power is sick <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  the nature of the sickness found ulysses
    what is the remedy
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  the great achilles whom opinion crowns
    the sinew and the forehand of our host
    having his ear full of his airy fame
    grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
    lies mocking our designs with him patroclus
    upon a lazy bed the livelong day
    breaks scurril jests
    and with ridiculous and awkward action
    which slanderer he imitation calls
    he pageants us <SENTENCE-END>  sometime great agamemnon
    thy topless deputation he puts on
    and like a strutting player whose conceit
    lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
    to hear the wooden dialogue and sound  
    twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage
    such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming
    he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
    tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard
    which from the tongue of roaring typhon droppd
    would seem hyperboles <SENTENCE-END>  at this fusty stuff
    the large achilles on his pressd bed lolling
    from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
    cries excellent tis agamemnon just <SENTENCE-END> 
    now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard
    as he being drest to some oration <SENTENCE-END> 
    thats doneas near as the extremest ends
    of parallels as like vulcan and his wife
    yet god achilles still cries excellent
    tis nestor right <SENTENCE-END>  now play him me patroclus
    arming to answer in a night alarm <SENTENCE-END> 
    and then forsooth the faint defects of age
    must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
    and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget
    shake in and out the rivet <SENTENCE-END>  and at this sport  
    sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus
    or give me ribs of steel i shall split all
    in pleasure of my spleen <SENTENCE-END>  and in this fashion
    all our abilities gifts natures shapes
    severals and generals of grace exact
    achievements plots orders preventions
    excitements to the field or speech for truce
    success or loss what is or is not serves
    as stuff for these two to make paradoxes <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  and in the imitation of these twain
    who as ulysses says opinion crowns
    with an imperial voicemany are infect <SENTENCE-END> 
    ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head
    in such a rein in full as proud a place
    as broad achilles keeps his tent like him
    makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle and sets thersites
    a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
    to match us in comparisons with dirt
    to weaken and discredit our exposure  
    how rank soever rounded in with danger <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  they tax our policy and call it cowardice
    count wisdom as no member of the war
    forestall prescience and esteem no act
    but that of hand <SENTENCE-END>  the still and mental parts
    that do contrive how many hands shall strike
    when fitness calls them on and know by measure
    of their observant toil the enemies weight
    why this hath not a fingers dignity
    they call this bedwork mappry closetwar
    so that the ram that batters down the wall
    for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise
    they place before his hand that made the engine
    or those that with the fineness of their souls
    by reason guide his execution <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  let this be granted and achilles horse
    makes many thetis sons <SENTENCE-END>                                  tucket
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  what trumpet look menelaus <SENTENCE-END> 
  menelaus <SENTENCE-END>  from troy <SENTENCE-END> 
  
                      enter aeneas

  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  what would you fore our tent
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  is this great agamemnons tent i pray you
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  even this <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  may one that is a herald and a prince
    do a fair message to his kingly eyes
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  with surety stronger than achilles an
    fore all the greekish heads which with one voice
    call agamemnon head and general <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  fair leave and large security <SENTENCE-END>  how may
    a stranger to those most imperial looks
    know them from eyes of other mortals
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  how
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  ay
    i ask that i might waken reverence
    and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
    modest as morning when she coldly eyes
    the youthful phoebus <SENTENCE-END> 
    which is that god in office guiding men  
    which is the high and mighty agamemnon
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  this troyan scorns us or the men of troy
    are ceremonious courtiers <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  courtiers as free as debonair unarmd
    as bending angels thats their fame in peace <SENTENCE-END> 
    but when they would seem soldiers they have galls
    good arms strong joints true swords and joves accord
    nothing so full of heart <SENTENCE-END>  but peace aeneas
    peace troyan lay thy finger on thy lips <SENTENCE-END> 
    the worthiness of praise distains his worth
    if that the praisd himself bring the praise forth
    but what the repining enemy commends
    that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  ay greek that is my name <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  whats your affair i pray you
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  sir pardon tis for agamemnons ears <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  he hears nought privately that comes from troy <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  nor i from troy come not to whisper with him
    i bring a trumpet to awake his ear  
    to set his sense on the attentive bent
    and then to speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  speak frankly as the wind
    it is not agamemnons sleeping hour <SENTENCE-END> 
    that thou shalt know troyan he is awake
    he tells thee so himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  trumpet blow loud
    send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
    and every greek of mettle let him know
    what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                      sound trumpet
    we have great agamemnon here in troy
    a prince called hectorpriam is his father
    who in this dull and longcontinued truce
    is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet
    and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
    if there be one among the fairst of greece
    that holds his honour higher than his ease
    that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
    that knows his valour and knows not his fear  
    that loves his mistress more than in confession
    with truant vows to her own lips he loves
    and dare avow her beauty and her worth
    in other arms than hersto him this challenge <SENTENCE-END> 
    hector in view of troyans and of greeks
    shall make it good or do his best to do it
    he hath a lady wiser fairer truer
    than ever greek did couple in his arms
    and will tomorrow with his trumpet call
    midway between your tents and walls of troy
    to rouse a grecian that is true in love <SENTENCE-END> 
    if any come hector shall honour him
    if none hell say in troy when he retires
    the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    the splinter of a lance <SENTENCE-END>  even so much <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas <SENTENCE-END> 
    if none of them have soul in such a kind
    we left them all at home <SENTENCE-END>  but we are soldiers
    and may that soldier a mere recreant prove
    that means not hath not or is not in love <SENTENCE-END>   
    if then one is or hath or means to be
    that one meets hector if none else i am he <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  tell him of nestor one that was a man
    when hectors grandsire suckd <SENTENCE-END>  he is old now
    but if there be not in our grecian mould
    one noble man that hath one spark of fire
    to answer for his love tell him from me
    ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
    and in my vantbrace put this witherd brawn
    and meeting him will tell him that my lady
    was fairer than his grandame and as chaste
    as may be in the world <SENTENCE-END>  his youth in flood
    ill prove this truth with my three drops of blood <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  amen <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand
    to our pavilion shall i lead you first <SENTENCE-END> 
    achilles shall have word of this intent
    so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent <SENTENCE-END> 
    yourself shall feast with us before you go  
    and find the welcome of a noble foe <SENTENCE-END> 
                                    exeunt all but ulysses and nestor
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  nestor
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  what says ulysses
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  i have a young conception in my brain
    be you my time to bring it to some shape <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  what ist
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  this tis
    blunt wedges rive hard knots <SENTENCE-END>  the seeded pride
    that hath to this maturity blown up
    in rank achilles must or now be croppd
    or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
    to overbulk us all <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  well and how
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  this challenge that the gallant hector sends
    however it is spread in general name
    relates in purpose only to achilles <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  true <SENTENCE-END>  the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
    whose grossness little characters sum up
    and in the publication make no strain  
    but that achilles were his brain as barren
    as banks of libyathough apollo knows
    tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment
    ay with celerity find hectors purpose
    pointing on him <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  and wake him to the answer think you
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  why tis most meet <SENTENCE-END>  who may you else oppose
    that can from hector bring those honours off
    if not achilles though t be a sportful combat
    yet in this trial much opinion dwells
    for here the troyans taste our dearst repute
    with their finst palate and trust to me ulysses
    our imputation shall be oddly poisd
    in this vile action for the success
    although particular shall give a scantling
    of good or bad unto the general
    and in such indexes although small pricks
    to their subsequent volumes there is seen
    the baby figure of the giant mas
    of things to come at large <SENTENCE-END>  it is supposd  
    he that meets hector issues from our choice
    and choice being mutual act of all our souls
    makes merit her election and doth boil
    as twere from forth us all a man distilld
    out of our virtues who miscarrying
    what heart receives from hence a conquering part
    to steel a strong opinion to themselves
    which entertaind limbs are his instruments
    in no less working than are swords and bows
    directive by the limbs <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  give pardon to my speech <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector <SENTENCE-END> 
    let us like merchants show our foulest wares
    and think perchance theyll sell if not the lustre
    of the better yet to show shall show the better
    by showing the worst first <SENTENCE-END>  do not consent
    that ever hector and achilles meet
    for both our honour and our shame in this
    are doggd with two strange followers <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  i see them not with my old eyes <SENTENCE-END>  what are they  
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  what glory our achilles shares from hector
    were he not proud we all should wear with him
    but he already is too insolent
    and it were better parch in afric sun
    than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
    should he scape hector fair <SENTENCE-END>  if he were foild
    why then we do our main opinion crush
    in taint of our best man <SENTENCE-END>  no make a lottry
    and by device let blockish ajax draw
    the sort to fight with hector <SENTENCE-END>  among ourselves
    give him allowance for the better man
    for that will physic the great myrmidon
    who broils in loud applause and make him fall
    his crest that prouder than blue iris bends <SENTENCE-END> 
    if the dull brainless ajax come safe off
    well dress him up in voices if he fail
    yet go we under our opinion still
    that we have better men <SENTENCE-END>  but hit or miss
    our projects life this shape of sense assumes
    ajax employd plucks down achilles plumes <SENTENCE-END>   
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  now ulysses i begin to relish thy advice
    and i will give a taste thereof forthwith
    to agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  go we to him straight <SENTENCE-END> 
    two curs shall tame each other pride alone
    must tarre the mastiffs on as twere their bone <SENTENCE-END>           exeunt

act ii <SENTENCE-END>  scene 2 <SENTENCE-END> 
troy <SENTENCE-END>  priams palace

enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus

  priam <SENTENCE-END>  after so many hours lives speeches spent
    thus once again says nestor from the greeks
    deliver helen and all damage else
    as honour loss of time travail expense
    wounds friends and what else dear that is consumd
    in hot digestion of this cormorant war
    shall be struck off <SENTENCE-END>  hector what say you tot
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  though no man lesser fears the greeks than i
    as far as toucheth my particular
    yet dread priam
    there is no lady of more softer bowels
    more spongy to suck in the sense of fear
    more ready to cry out who knows what follows
    than hector is <SENTENCE-END>  the wound of peace is surety
    surety secure but modest doubt is calld
    the beacon of the wise the tent that searches
    to th bottom of the worst <SENTENCE-END>  let helen go <SENTENCE-END>   
    since the first sword was drawn about this question
    every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes
    hath been as dear as heleni mean of ours <SENTENCE-END> 
    if we have lost so many tenths of ours
    to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
    had it our name the value of one ten
    what merits in that reason which denies
    the yielding of her up
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  fie fie my brother
    weigh you the worth and honour of a king
    so great as our dread fathers in a scale
    of common ounces will you with counters sum
    the pastproportion of his infinite
    and buckle in a waist most fathomless
    with spans and inches so diminutive
    as fears and reasons fie for godly shame
  helenus <SENTENCE-END>  no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
    you are so empty of them <SENTENCE-END>  should not our father
    bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
    because your speech hath none that tells him so  
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
    you fur your gloves with reason <SENTENCE-END>  here are your reasons
    you know an enemy intends you harm
    you know a sword employd is perilous
    and reason flies the object of all harm <SENTENCE-END> 
    who marvels then when helenus beholds
    a grecian and his sword if he do set
    the very wings of reason to his heels
    and fly like chidden mercury from jove
    or like a star disorbd nay if we talk of reason
    lets shut our gates and sleep <SENTENCE-END>  manhood and honour
    should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts
    with this crammd reason <SENTENCE-END>  reason and respect
    make livers pale and lustihood deject <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  brother she is not worth what she doth cost
    the keeping <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  whats aught but as tis valued
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  but value dwells not in particular will
    it holds his estimate and dignity
    as well wherein tis precious of itself  
    as in the prizer <SENTENCE-END>  tis mad idolatry
    to make the service greater than the godi
    and the will dotes that is attributive
    to what infectiously itself affects
    without some image of th affected merit <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  i take today a wife and my election
    is led on in the conduct of my will
    my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
    two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores
    of will and judgment how may i avoid
    although my will distaste what it elected
    the wife i chose there can be no evasion
    to blench from this and to stand firm by honour <SENTENCE-END> 
    we turn not back the silks upon the merchant
    when we have soild them nor the remainder viands
    we do not throw in unrespective sieve
    because we now are full <SENTENCE-END>  it was thought meet
    paris should do some vengeance on the greeks
    your breath with full consent benied his sails
    the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce  
    and did him service <SENTENCE-END>  he touchd the ports desird
    and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive
    he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness
    wrinkles apollos and makes stale the morning <SENTENCE-END> 
    why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt <SENTENCE-END> 
    is she worth keeping why she is a pearl
    whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships
    and turnd crownd kings to merchants <SENTENCE-END> 
    if youll avouch twas wisdom paris went
    as you must needs for you all cried go go
    if youll confess he brought home worthy prize
    as you must needs for you all clappd your hands
    and cried inestimable why do you now
    the issue of your proper wisdoms rate
    and do a deed that never fortune did
    beggar the estimation which you prizd
    richer than sea and land o theft most base
    that we have stoln what we do fear to keep
    but thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln
    that in their country did them that disgrace  
    we fear to warrant in our native place
  cassandra <SENTENCE-END>  within cry troyans cry <SENTENCE-END> 
  priam <SENTENCE-END>  what noise what shriek is this
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  tis our mad sister i do know her voice <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassandra <SENTENCE-END>  within cry troyans <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  it is cassandra <SENTENCE-END> 

                  enter cassandra raving

  cassandra <SENTENCE-END>  cry troyans cry <SENTENCE-END>  lend me ten thousand eyes
    and i will fill them with prophetic tears <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  peace sister peace <SENTENCE-END> 
  cassandra <SENTENCE-END>  virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld
    soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
    add to my clamours <SENTENCE-END>  let us pay betimes
    a moiety of that mass of moan to come <SENTENCE-END> 
    cry troyans cry <SENTENCE-END>  practise your eyes with tears <SENTENCE-END> 
    troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand
    our firebrand brother paris burns us all <SENTENCE-END> 
    cry troyans cry a helen and a woe  
    cry cry <SENTENCE-END>  troy burns or else let helen go <SENTENCE-END>                   exit
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  now youthful troilus do not these high strains
    of divination in our sister work
    some touches of remorse or is your blood
    so madly hot that no discourse of reason
    nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
    can qualify the same
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  why brother hector
    we may not think the justness of each act
    such and no other than event doth form it
    nor once deject the courage of our minds
    because cassandras mad <SENTENCE-END>  her brainsick raptures
    cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
    which hath our several honours all engagd
    to make it gracious <SENTENCE-END>  for my private part
    i am no more touchd than all priams sons
    and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
    such things as might offend the weakest spleen
    to fight for and maintain <SENTENCE-END> 
  paris <SENTENCE-END>  else might the world convince of levity  
    as well my undertakings as your counsels
    but i attest the gods your full consent
    gave wings to my propension and cut of
    all fears attending on so dire a project <SENTENCE-END> 
    for what alas can these my single arms
    what propugnation is in one mans valour
    to stand the push and enmity of those
    this quarrel would excite yet i protest
    were i alone to pass the difficulties
    and had as ample power as i have will
    paris should neer retract what he hath done
    nor faint in the pursuit <SENTENCE-END> 
  priam <SENTENCE-END>  paris you speak
    like one besotted on your sweet delights <SENTENCE-END> 
    you have the honey still but these the gall
    so to be valiant is no praise at all <SENTENCE-END> 
  paris <SENTENCE-END>  sir i propose not merely to myself
    the pleasures such a beauty brings with it
    but i would have the soil of her fair rape
    wipd off in honourable keeping her <SENTENCE-END>   
    what treason were it to the ransackd queen
    disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
    now to deliver her possession up
    on terms of base compulsion can it be
    that so degenerate a strain as this
    should once set footing in your generous bosoms
    theres not the meanest spirit on our party
    without a heart to dare or sword to draw
    when helen is defended nor none so noble
    whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd
    where helen is the subject <SENTENCE-END>  then i say
    well may we fight for her whom we know well
    the worlds large spaces cannot parallel <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  paris and troilus you have both said well
    and on the cause and question now in hand
    have glozd but superficially not much
    unlike young men whom aristode thought
    unfit to hear moral philosophy <SENTENCE-END> 
    the reasons you allege do more conduce
    to the hot passion of distempred blood  
    than to make up a free determination
    twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge
    have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
    of any true decision <SENTENCE-END>  nature craves
    all dues be rendred to their owners <SENTENCE-END>  now
    what nearer debt in all humanity
    than wife is to the husband if this law
    of nature be corrupted through affection
    and that great minds of partial indulgence
    to their benumbed wills resist the same
    there is a law in each wellorderd nation
    to curb those raging appetites that are
    most disobedient and refractory <SENTENCE-END> 
    if helen then be wife to spartas king
    as it is known she isthese moral laws
    of nature and of nations speak aloud
    to have her back returnd <SENTENCE-END>  thus to persist
    in doing wrong extenuates not wrong
    but makes it much more heavy <SENTENCE-END>  hectors opinion
    is this in way of truth <SENTENCE-END>  yet neer the less  
    my spritely brethren i propend to you
    in resolution to keep helen still
    for tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
    upon our joint and several dignities <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  why there you touchd the life of our design <SENTENCE-END> 
    were it not glory that we more affected
    than the performance of our heaving spleens
    i would not wish a drop of troyan blood
    spent more in her defence <SENTENCE-END>  but worthy hector
    she is a theme of honour and renown
    a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
    whose present courage may beat down our foes
    and fame in time to come canonize us
    for i presume brave hector would not lose
    so rich advantage of a promisd glory
    as smiles upon the forehead of this action
    for the wide worlds revenue <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  i am yours
    you valiant offspring of great priamus <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have a roisting challenge sent amongst  
    the dull and factious nobles of the greeks
    will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits <SENTENCE-END> 
    i was advertisd their great general slept
    whilst emulation in the army crept <SENTENCE-END> 
    this i presume will wake him <SENTENCE-END>                             exeunt

    did move your greatness and this noble state
    to call upon him he hopes it is no other
    but for your health and your digestion sake
    an afterdinners breath <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  hear you patroclus <SENTENCE-END> 
    we are too well acquainted with these answers
    but his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn
    cannot outfly our apprehensions <SENTENCE-END>   
    much attribute he hath and much the reason
    why we ascribe it to him <SENTENCE-END>  yet all his virtues
    not virtuously on his own part beheld
    do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
    yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
    are like to rot untasted <SENTENCE-END>  go and tell him
    we come to speak with him and you shall not sin
    if you do say we think him overproud
    and underhonest in selfassumption greater
    than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself
    here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
    disguise the holy strength of their command
    and underwrite in an observing kind
    his humorous predominance yea watch
    his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
    the passage and whole carriage of this action
    rode on his tide <SENTENCE-END>  go tell him this and ad
    that if he overhold his price so much
    well none of him but let him like an engine
    not portable lie under this report  
    bring action hither this cannot go to war <SENTENCE-END> 
    a stirring dwarf we do allowance give

  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  what is he more than another
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  no more than what he thinks he is <SENTENCE-END>

    man than i am
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  no question <SENTENCE-END> 
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  will you subscribe his thought and say he is
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise
    no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable <SENTENCE-END> 
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  why should a man be proud how doth pride grow i know not
    what pride is <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the
    fairer <SENTENCE-END>  he that is proud eats up himself <SENTENCE-END>  pride is his own glass
    his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself  
    but in the deed devours the deed in the praise <SENTENCE-END> 

                      reenter ulysses

  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  i do hate a proud man as i do hate the engendring of toads <SENTENCE-END>

  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  achilles will not to the field tomorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  whats his excuse
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  he doth rely on none
    but carries on the stream of his dispose
    without observance or respect of any
    in will peculiar and in selfadmission <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  why will he not upon our fair request
    untent his person and share the air with us
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  things small as nothing for requests sake only
    he makes important possessd he is with greatness
    and speaks not to himself but with a pride
    that quarrels at selfbreath <SENTENCE-END>  imagind worth
    holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
    that twixt his mental and his active parts  
    kingdomd achilles in commotion rages
    and batters down himself <SENTENCE-END>  what should i say
    he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it
    cry no recovery <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  let ajax go to him <SENTENCE-END> 
    dear lord go you and greet him in his tent <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis said he holds you well and will be led
    at your request a little from himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  o agamemnon let it not be so
    well consecrate the steps that ajax makes
    when they go from achilles <SENTENCE-END>  shall the proud lord

    and never suffers matter of the world
    enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve
    and ruminate himselfshall he be worshippd
    of that we hold an idol more than he
    no this thriceworthy and right valiant lord
    shall not so stale his palm nobly acquird
    nor by my will assubjugate his merit
    as amply titled as achilles is  
    by going to achilles <SENTENCE-END> 
    that were to enlard his fatalready pride
    and add more coals to cancer when he burns
    with entertaining great hyperion <SENTENCE-END> 
    this lord go to him jupiter forbid
    and say in thunder achilles go to him <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  aside o this is well he rubs the vein of him <SENTENCE-END>

  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  if i go to him with my armed fist ill pash him oer the
    face <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  o no you shall not go <SENTENCE-END> 
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  an a be proud with me ill pheeze his pride <SENTENCE-END> 
    let me go to him <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel <SENTENCE-END>

  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing
    than blind reason stumbling without fear <SENTENCE-END>  to fear the worst oft
    cures the worse <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  o let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupids pageant
    there is presented no monster <SENTENCE-END>   
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  nor nothing monstrous neither
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas
    live in fire cat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our
    mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any
    difficulty imposed <SENTENCE-END>  this is the monstruosity in love lady that
    the will is infinite and the execution confind that the desire
    is boundless and the act a slave to limit <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  they say all lovers swear more performance than they are
    able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing
    more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the
    tenth part of one <SENTENCE-END>  they that have the voice of lions and the act
    of hares are they not monsters
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  are there such such are not we <SENTENCE-END>  praise us as we are
    tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit
    crown it <SENTENCE-END>  no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in
    present <SENTENCE-END>  we will not name desert before his birth and being
    born his addition shall be humble <SENTENCE-END>  few words to fair faith
    troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall
    be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not
    truer than troilus <SENTENCE-END>   
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  will you walk in my lord

                    reenter pandarus

  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  what blushing still have you not done talking yet

    prince troilus i have lovd you night and day
    for many weary months <SENTENCE-END>

  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  hard to seem won but i was won my lord
    with the first glance that everpardon me <SENTENCE-END>   
    if i confess much you will play the tyrant <SENTENCE-END> 
    i love you now but till now not so much
    but i might master it <SENTENCE-END>  in faith i lie
    my thoughts were like unbridled children grown
    too headstrong for their mother <SENTENCE-END>  see we fools
    why have i blabbd who shall be true to us
    when we are so unsecret to ourselves
    but though i lovd you well i wood you not
    and yet good faith i wishd myself a man
    or that we women had mens privilege
    of speaking first <SENTENCE-END>  sweet bid me hold my tongue
    for in this rapture i shall surely speak
    the thing i shall repent <SENTENCE-END>  see see your silence
    cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
    my very soul of counsel <SENTENCE-END>  stop my mouth <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  and shall albeit sweet music issues thence <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  pretty i faith <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  my lord i do beseech you pardon me
    twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss <SENTENCE-END>

  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  pray you content you <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  what offends you lady
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  sir mine own company <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  you cannot shun yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  let me go and try <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have a kind of self resides with you
    but an unkind self that itself will leave
    to be anothers fool <SENTENCE-END>  i would be gone <SENTENCE-END> 
    where is my wit i know not what i speak <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  well know they what they speak that speak so wisely <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  perchance my lord i show more craft than love
    and fell so roundly to a large confession
    to angle for your thoughts but you are wise
    or else you love not for to be wise and love
    exceeds mans might that dwells with gods above <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  o that i thought it could be in a woman
    as if it can i will presume in you  
    to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love
    to keep her constancy in plight and youth
    outliving beautys outward with a mind
    that doth renew swifter than blood decays
    or that persuasion could but thus convince me
    that my integrity and truth to you
    might be affronted with the match and weight
    of such a winnowed purity in love <SENTENCE-END> 
    how were i then uplifted but alas
    i am as true as truths simplicity
    and simpler than the infancy of truth <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  in that ill war with you <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  o virtuous fight
    when right with right wars who shall be most right
    true swains in love shall in the world to come
    approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes
    full of protest of oath and big compare
    want similes truth tird with iteration
    as true as steel as plantage to the moon
    as sun to day as turtle to her mate  
    as iron to adamant as earth to th centre
    yet after all comparisons of truth
    as truths authentic author to be cited
    as true as troilus shall crown up the verse
    and sanctify the numbers <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  prophet may you be
    if i be false or swerve a hair from truth
    when time is old and hath forgot itself
    when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy
    and blind oblivion swallowd cities up
    and mighty states characterless are grated
    to dusty nothingyet let memory
    from false to false among false maids in love
    upbraid my falsehood when th have said as false
    as air as water wind or sandy earth
    as fox to lamb or wolf to heifers calf
    pard to the hind or stepdame to her son
    yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
    as false as cressid <SENTENCE-END> 
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  go to a bargain made seal it seal it ill be the  
    witness <SENTENCE-END>  here i hold your hand here my cousins <SENTENCE-END>  if ever you
    prove false one to another since i have taken such pains to
    bring you together let all pitiful goers between be calld to
    the worlds end after my namecall them all pandars let all
    constant men be troiluses all false women cressids and all

    and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
    pretty encounters press it to death <SENTENCE-END>  away

    must fall out with men too <SENTENCE-END>  what the declind is
    he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
    as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
    show not their mealy wings but to the summer
    and not a man for being simply man
    hath any honour but honour for those honours
    that are without him as place riches and favour
    prizes of accident as oft as merit
    which when they fall as being slippery standers
    the love that leand on them as slippery too
    doth one pluck down another and together
    die in the fall <SENTENCE-END>  but tis not so with me
    fortune and i are friends i do enjoy
    at ample point all that i did possess  
    save these mens looks who do methinks find out
    something not worth in me such rich beholding
    as they have often given <SENTENCE-END>  here is ulysses <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill interrupt his reading <SENTENCE-END> 
    how now ulysses
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  now great thetis son
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  what are you reading
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  a strange fellow here
    writes me that manhow dearly ever parted
    how much in having or without or in
    cannot make boast to have that which he hath
    nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
    as when his virtues shining upon others
    heat them and they retort that heat again
    to the first giver <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  this is not strange ulysses <SENTENCE-END> 
    the beauty that is borne here in the face
    the bearer knows not but commends itself
    to others eyes nor doth the eye itself
    that most pure spirit of sensebehold itself  
    not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
    salutes each other with each others form
    for speculation turns not to itself
    till it hath travelld and is mirrord there
    where it may see itself <SENTENCE-END>  this is not strange at all <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  i do not strain at the position
    it is familiarbut at the authors drift
    who in his circumstance expressly proves
    that no man is the lord of anything
    though in and of him there be much consisting
    till he communicate his parts to others
    nor doth he of himself know them for aught
    till he behold them formed in th applause
    where th are extended who like an arch reverbrate
    the voice again or like a gate of steel
    fronting the sun receives and renders back
    his figure and his heat <SENTENCE-END>  i was much rapt in this
    and apprehended here immediately
    th unknown ajax <SENTENCE-END>  heavens what a man is there
    a very horse that has he knows not what  
    nature what things there are
    most abject in regard and dear in use
    what things again most dear in the esteem
    and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow
    an act that very chance doth throw upon him
    ajax renownd <SENTENCE-END>  o heavens what some men do
    while some men leave to do
    how some men creep in skittish fortuneshall
    whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
    how one man eats into anothers pride
    while pride is fasting in his wantonness
    to see these grecian lordswhy even already
    they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder
    as if his foot were on brave hectors breast
    and great troy shrinking <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  i do believe it for they passd by me
    as misers do by beggarsneither gave to me
    good word nor look <SENTENCE-END>  what are my deeds forgot
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  time hath my lord a wallet at his back
    wherein he puts alms for oblivion  
    a greatsizd monster of ingratitudes <SENTENCE-END> 
    those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd
    as fast as they are made forgot as soon
    as done <SENTENCE-END>  perseverance dear my lord
    keeps honour bright <SENTENCE-END>  to have done is to hang
    quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
    in monumental mockry <SENTENCE-END>  take the instant way
    for honour travels in a strait so narrow 
    where one but goes abreast <SENTENCE-END>  keep then the path
    for emulation hath a thousand sons
    that one by one pursue if you give way
    or hedge aside from the direct forthright
    like to an entred tide they all rush by
    and leave you hindmost
    or like a gallant horse falln in first rank
    lie there for pavement to the abject rear
    oerrun and trampled on <SENTENCE-END>  then what they do in present
    though less than yours in past must oertop yours
    for time is like a fashionable host
    that slightly shakes his parting guest by th hand  
    and with his arms outstretchd as he would fly
    grasps in the corner <SENTENCE-END>  the welcome ever smiles
    and farewell goes out sighing <SENTENCE-END>  o let not virtue seek
    remuneration for the thing it was
    for beauty wit
    high birth vigour of bone desert in service
    love friendship charity are subjects all
    to envious and calumniating time <SENTENCE-END> 
    one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
    that all with one consent praise newborn gawds
    though they are made and moulded of things past
    and give to dust that is a little gilt
    more laud than gilt oerdusted <SENTENCE-END> 
    the present eye praises the present object <SENTENCE-END> 
    then marvel not thou great and complete man
    that all the greeks begin to worship ajax
    since things in motion sooner catch the eye
    than what stirs not <SENTENCE-END>  the cry went once on thee
    and still it might and yet it may again
    if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive  
    and case thy reputation in thy tent
    whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
    made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves
    and drave great mars to faction <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  of this my privacy
    i have strong reasons <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  but gainst your privacy
    the reasons are more potent and heroical <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis known achilles that you are in love
    with one of priams daughters <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  ha known
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  is that a wonder
    the providence thats in a watchful state
    knows almost every grain of plutus gold
    finds bottom in th uncomprehensive deeps
    keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
    do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is a mysterywith whom relation
    durst never meddlein the soul of state
    which hath an operation more divine  
    than breath or pen can give expressure to <SENTENCE-END> 
    all the commerce that you have had with troy
    as perfectly is ours as yours my lord
    and better would it fit achilles much
    to throw down hector than polyxena <SENTENCE-END> 
    but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home
    when fame shall in our island sound her trump
    and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing
    great hectors sister did achilles win
    but our great ajax bravely beat down him <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell my lord <SENTENCE-END>  i as your lover speak <SENTENCE-END> 
    the fool slides oer the ice that you should break <SENTENCE-END>           exit
  patroclus <SENTENCE-END>  to this effect achilles have i movd you <SENTENCE-END> 
    a woman impudent and mannish grown
    is not more loathd than an effeminate man
    in time of action <SENTENCE-END>  i stand condemnd for this
    they think my little stomach to the war
    and your great love to me restrains you thus <SENTENCE-END> 
    sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid
    shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold  
    and like a dewdrop from the lions mane
    be shook to airy air <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  shall ajax fight with hector
  patroclus <SENTENCE-END>  ay and perhaps receive much honour by him <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  i see my reputation is at stake
    my fame is shrewdly gord <SENTENCE-END> 
  patroclus <SENTENCE-END>  o then beware
    those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
    omission to do what is necessary
    seals a commission to a blank of danger
    and danger like an ague subtly taints
    even then when they sit idly in the sun <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  go call thersites hither sweet patroclus <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill send the fool to ajax and desire him
    t invite the troyan lords after the combat
    to see us here unarmd <SENTENCE-END>  i have a womans longing
    an appetite that i am sick withal
    to see great hector in his weeds of peace
    to talk with him and to behold his visage
    even to my full of view <SENTENCE-END>   

                     enter thersites

    a labour savd
  thersites <SENTENCE-END>  a wonder
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  what
  thersites <SENTENCE-END>  ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  how so
  thersites <SENTENCE-END>  he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so
    prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in
    saying nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  how can that be
  thersites <SENTENCE-END>  why a stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a
    stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her
    brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic
    regard as who should say there were wit in this head an
    twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as
    fire in a flint which will not show without knocking <SENTENCE-END>  the mans
    undone for ever for if hector break not his neck i th combat
    hell breakt himself in vainglory <SENTENCE-END>  he knows not me <SENTENCE-END>  i said good  
    morrow ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  what think you
    of this man that takes me for the general hes grown a very land
    fish languageless a monster <SENTENCE-END>  a plague of opinion a man may
    wear it on both sides like leather jerkin <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  thou must be my ambassador to him thersites <SENTENCE-END> 
  thersites <SENTENCE-END>  who i why hell answer nobody he professes not
    answering <SENTENCE-END>  speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins
    arms <SENTENCE-END>  i will put on his presence <SENTENCE-END>  let patroclus make his demands
    to me you shall see the pageant of ajax <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  to him patroclus <SENTENCE-END>  tell him i humbly desire the valiant
    ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmd to my
    tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the

    during all question of the gentle truce
    but when i meet you armd as black defiance
    as heart can think or courage execute <SENTENCE-END>   
  diomedes <SENTENCE-END>  the one and other diomed embraces <SENTENCE-END> 
    our bloods are now in calm and so long health
    but when contention and occasion meet
    by jove ill play the hunter for thy life
    with all my force pursuit and policy <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
    with his face backward <SENTENCE-END>  in humane gentleness
    welcome to troy now by anchises life
    welcome indeed by venus hand i swear
    no man alive can love in such a sort
    the thing he means to kill more excellently <SENTENCE-END> 
  diomedes <SENTENCE-END>  we sympathise <SENTENCE-END>  jove let aeneas live
    if to my sword his fate be not the glory
    a thousand complete courses of the sun

    my brother troilus lodges there tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
    rouse him and give him note of our approach
    with the whole quality wherefore i fear
    we shall be much unwelcome <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  that i assure you
    troilus had rather troy were borne to greece

    not making any scruple of her soilure
    with such a hell of pain and world of charge
    and you as well to keep her that defend her
    not palating the taste of her dishonour
    with such a costly loss of wealth and friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    he like a puling cuckold would drink up
    the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
    you like a lecher out of whorish loins
    are pleasd to breed out your inheritors <SENTENCE-END> 
    both merits poisd each weighs nor less nor more
    but he as he the heavier for a whore <SENTENCE-END> 
  paris <SENTENCE-END>  you are too bitter to your countrywoman <SENTENCE-END> 
  diomedes <SENTENCE-END>  shes bitter to her country <SENTENCE-END>  hear me paris
    for every false drop in her bawdy veins
    a grecians life hath sunk for every scruple  
    of her contaminated carrion weight
    a troyan hath been slain since she could speak
    she hath not given so many good words breath
    as for her greeks and troyans suffred death <SENTENCE-END> 
  paris <SENTENCE-END>  fair diomed you do as chapmen do
    dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
    but we in silence hold this virtue well
    well not commend what we intend to sell <SENTENCE-END> 
    here lies our way <SENTENCE-END>                                          exeunt

    the grief is fine full perfect that i taste
    and violenteth in a sense as strong
    as that which causeth it <SENTENCE-END>  how can i moderate it
    if i could temporize with my affections
    or brew it to a weak and colder palate
    the like allayment could i give my grief <SENTENCE-END> 
    my love admits no qualifying dross
    no more my grief in such a precious loss <SENTENCE-END>

    heart as the goodly saying is  
          o heart heavy heart
       why sighst thou without breaking
    where he answers again
       because thou canst not ease thy smart
       by friendship nor by speaking <SENTENCE-END> 
    there was never a truer rhyme <SENTENCE-END>  let us cast away nothing for we
    may live to have need of such a verse <SENTENCE-END>  we see it we see it <SENTENCE-END>  how
    now lambs
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  cressid i love thee in so straind a purity
    that the blessd gods as angry with my fancy
    more bright in zeal than the devotion which
    cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  have the gods envy
  pandarus <SENTENCE-END>  ay ay ay tis too plain a case <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  and is it true that i must go from troy
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  a hateful truth <SENTENCE-END>

  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  ist possible
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  and suddenly where injury of chance  
    puts back leavetaking justles roughly by
    all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
    of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
    our lockd embrasures strangles our dear vows
    even in the birth of our own labouring breath <SENTENCE-END> 
    we two that with so many thousand sighs
    did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
    with the rude brevity and discharge of one <SENTENCE-END> 
    injurious time now with a robbers haste
    crams his rich thievery up he knows not how <SENTENCE-END> 
    as many farewells as be stars in heaven
    with distinct breath and consignd kisses to them
    he fumbles up into a loose adieu
    and scants us with a single famishd kiss
    distasted with the salt of broken tears <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  within my lord is the lady ready
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  hark you are calld <SENTENCE-END>  some say the genius so
    cries come to him that instantly must die <SENTENCE-END> 
    bid them have patience she shall come anon <SENTENCE-END>

    for it is parting from us <SENTENCE-END> 
    i speak not be thou true as fearing thee
    for i will throw my glove to death himself
    that theres no maculation in thy heart
    but be thou true say i to fashion in
    my sequent protestation be thou true
    and i will see thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  o you shall be exposd my lord to dangers

    to give thee nightly visitation <SENTENCE-END> 
    but yet be true <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  o heavens be true again
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  hear why i speak it love <SENTENCE-END> 
    the grecian youths are full of quality
    theyre loving well composd with gifts of nature
    and flowing oer with arts and exercise <SENTENCE-END> 
    how novelties may move and parts with person
    alas a kind of godly jealousy
    which i beseech you call a virtuous sin
    makes me afeard <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  o heavens you love me not <SENTENCE-END> 
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  die i a villain then
    in this i do not call your faith in question
    so mainly as my merit <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot sing
    nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
    nor play at subtle gamesfair virtues all
    to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant
    but i can tell that in each grace of these
    there lurks a still and dumbdiscoursive devil  
    that tempts most cunningly <SENTENCE-END>  but be not tempted <SENTENCE-END> 
  cressida <SENTENCE-END>  do you think i will
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END> 
    but something may be done that we will not
    and sometimes we are devils to ourselves
    when we will tempt the frailty of our powers
    presuming on their changeful potency <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  within nay good my lord
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  come kiss and let us part <SENTENCE-END>

        enter hector armed aeneas troilus paris helenus
                 and other trojans with attendants

  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  yonder comes the troop <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  hail all the state of greece what shall be done
    to him that victory commands or do you purpose
    a victor shall be known will you the knights
    shall to the edge of all extremity
    pursue each other or shall they be divided
    by any voice or order of the field
    hector bade ask <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  which way would hector have it
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  he cares not hell obey conditions <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  tis done like hector but securely done
    a little proudly and great deal misprizing
    the knight opposd <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  if not achilles sir  
    what is your name
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  if not achilles nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  therefore achilles <SENTENCE-END>  but whateer know this
    in the extremity of great and little
    valour and pride excel themselves in hector
    the one almost as infinite as all
    the other blank as nothing <SENTENCE-END>  weigh him well
    and that which looks like pride is courtesy <SENTENCE-END> 
    this ajax is half made of hectors blood
    in love whereof half hector stays at home
    half heart half hand half hector comes to seek
    this blended knight half troyan and half greek <SENTENCE-END> 
  achilles <SENTENCE-END>  a maiden battle then o i perceive you

                   reenter diomedes

  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  here is sir diomed <SENTENCE-END>  go gentle knight
    stand by our ajax <SENTENCE-END>  as you and lord eneas
    consent upon the order of their fight
    so be it either to the uttermost  
    or else a breath <SENTENCE-END>  the combatants being kin
    half stints their strife before their strokes begin <SENTENCE-END> 
                                    ajax and hector enter the lists
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  they are opposd already <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  what troyan is that same that looks so heavy
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  the youngest son of priam a true knight
    not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
    speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
    not soon provokd nor being provokd soon calmd
    his heart and hand both open and both free
    for what he has he gives what thinks he shows
    yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
    nor dignifies an impair thought with breath
    manly as hector but more dangerous
    for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
    to tender objects but he in heat of action
    is more vindicative than jealous love <SENTENCE-END> 
    they call him troilus and on him erect
    a second hope as fairly built as hector <SENTENCE-END> 
    thus says aeneas one that knows the youth  
    even to his inches and with private soul
    did in great ilion thus translate him to me <SENTENCE-END> 
                                      alarum <SENTENCE-END>  hector and ajax fight
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  they are in action <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  now ajax hold thine own
  troilus <SENTENCE-END>  hector thou sleepst
    awake thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  agamemnon <SENTENCE-END>  his blows are well disposd <SENTENCE-END>  there ajax
                                                     trumpets cease
  diomedes <SENTENCE-END>  you must no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  princes enough so please you <SENTENCE-END> 
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  i am not warm yet let us fight again <SENTENCE-END> 
  diomedes <SENTENCE-END>  as hector pleases <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  why then will i no more <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou art great lord my fathers sisters son
    a cousingerman to great priams seed
    the obligation of our blood forbids
    a gory emulation twixt us twain
    were thy commixtion greek and troyan so
    that thou couldst say this hand is grecian all  
    and this is troyan the sinews of this leg
    all greek and this all troy my mothers blood
    runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
    bounds in my fathers by jove multipotent
    thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member
    wherein my sword had not impressure made
    of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
    that any drop thou borrowdst from thy mother
    my sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
    be drained let me embrace thee ajax <SENTENCE-END> 
    by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
    hector would have them fall upon him thus <SENTENCE-END> 
    cousin all honour to thee
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  i thank thee hector <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou art too gentle and too free a man <SENTENCE-END> 
    i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
    a great addition earned in thy death <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  not neoptolemus so mirable
    on whose bright crest fame with her loudst oyes
    cries this is he could promise to himself  
    a thought of added honour torn from hector <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  there is expectance here from both the sides
    what further you will do <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  well answer it
    the issue is embracement <SENTENCE-END>  ajax farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  if i might in entreaties find success
    as seld i have the chance i would desire
    my famous cousin to our grecian tents <SENTENCE-END> 
  diomedes <SENTENCE-END>  tis agamemnons wish and great achilles
    doth long to see unarmd the valiant hector <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  aeneas call my brother troilus to me

    through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee
    as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed
    despising many forfeits and subduements
    when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i th air
    not letting it decline on the declined
    that i have said to some my standersby
    lo jupiter is yonder dealing life
    and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath
    when that a ring of greeks have hemmd thee in
    like an olympian wrestling <SENTENCE-END>  this have i seen
    but this thy countenance still lockd in steel
    i never saw till now <SENTENCE-END>  i knew thy grandsire
    and once fought with him <SENTENCE-END>  he was a soldier good
    but by great mars the captain of us all
    never like thee <SENTENCE-END>  o let an old man embrace thee  
    and worthy warrior welcome to our tents <SENTENCE-END> 
  aeneas <SENTENCE-END>  tis the old nestor <SENTENCE-END>

    that hast so long walkd hand in hand with time <SENTENCE-END> 
    most reverend nestor i am glad to clasp thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  nestor <SENTENCE-END>  i would my arms could match thee in contention
    as they contend with thee in courtesy <SENTENCE-END>

    ah sir theres many a greek and troyan dead
    since first i saw yourself and diomed
    in ilion on your greekish embassy <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  sir i foretold you then what would ensue <SENTENCE-END> 
    my prophecy is but half his journey yet
    for yonder walls that pertly front your town  
    yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
    must kiss their own feet <SENTENCE-END> 
  hector <SENTENCE-END>  i must not believe you <SENTENCE-END> 
    there they stand yet and modestly i think
    the fall of every phrygian stone will cost
    a drop of grecian blood <SENTENCE-END>  the end crowns all
    and that old common arbitrator time
    will one day end it <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  so to him we leave it <SENTENCE-END>

  hector <SENTENCE-END>  it would discredit the blest gods proud man
    to answer such a question <SENTENCE-END>  stand again <SENTENCE-END>

    as to prenominate in nice conjecture
    where thou wilt hit me dead

  hector <SENTENCE-END>  wert thou an oracle to tell me so
    id not believe thee <SENTENCE-END>  henceforth guard thee well

    but by the forge that stithied mars his helm

    you wisest grecians pardon me this brag <SENTENCE-END> 
    his insolence draws folly from my lips

    or may i never
  ajax <SENTENCE-END>  do not chafe thee cousin
    and you achilles let these threats alone
    till accident or purpose bring you tot <SENTENCE-END> 
    you may have every day enough of hector

    of every syllable that here was spoke <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if i tell how these two did coact
    shall i not lie in publishing a truth
    sith yet there is a credence in my heart
    an esperance so obstinately strong
    that doth invert th attest of eyes and ears
    as if those organs had deceptious functions
    created only to calumniate <SENTENCE-END> 
    was cressid here
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot conjure troyan <SENTENCE-END>

    for depravation to square the general sex
    by cressids rule <SENTENCE-END>  rather think this not cressid <SENTENCE-END> 
  ulysses <SENTENCE-END>  what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers

    that strain again it had a dying fall
    o it came oer my ear like the sweet sound
    that breathes upon a bank of violets
    stealing and giving odour enough no more
    tis not so sweet now as it was before <SENTENCE-END> 
    o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
    that notwithstanding thy capacity
    receiveth as the sea nought enters there
    of what validity and pitch soeer
    but falls into abatement and low price
    even in a minute <SENTENCE-END>  so full of shapes is fancy
    that it alone is high fantastical <SENTENCE-END>

    but from her handmaid do return this answer
    the element itself till seven years heat
    shall not behold her face at ample view
    but like a cloistress she will veiled walk
    and water once a day her chamber round
    with eyeoffending brine all this to season
    a brothers dead love which she would keep fresh  
    and lasting in her sad remembrance <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  o she that hath a heart of that fine frame
    to pay this debt of love but to a brother
    how will she love when the rich golden shaft
    hath killd the flock of all affections else
    that live in her when liver brain and heart
    these sovereign thrones are all supplied and filld
    her sweet perfections with one self king
    away before me to sweet beds of flowrs
    lovethoughts lie rich when canopied with bowrs <SENTENCE-END>

enter duke viola curio and others

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  give me some music <SENTENCE-END>  now good morrow friends <SENTENCE-END> 
    now good cesario but that piece of song
    that old and antique song we heard last night
    methought it did relieve my passion much
    more than light airs and recollected terms
    of these most brisk and giddypaced times <SENTENCE-END> 
    come but one verse <SENTENCE-END> 
  curio <SENTENCE-END>  he is not here so please your lordship that should sing
    it <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  who was it
  curio <SENTENCE-END>  feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady olivias
    father took much delight in <SENTENCE-END>  he is about the house <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  seek him out and play the tune the while <SENTENCE-END> 
                                       exit curio <SENTENCE-END>  music plays
    come hither boy <SENTENCE-END>  if ever thou shalt love
    in the sweet pangs of it remember me
    for such as i am all true lovers are  
    unstaid and skittish in all motions else
    save in the constant image of the creature
    that is belovd <SENTENCE-END>  how dost thou like this tune
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  it gives a very echo to the seat
    where love is thrond <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost speak masterly <SENTENCE-END> 
    my life upont young though thou art thine eye
    hath stayd upon some favour that it loves

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  too old by heaven let still the woman take
    an elder than herself so wears she to him
    so sways she level in her husbands heart <SENTENCE-END> 
    for boy however we do praise ourselves
    our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
    more longing wavering sooner lost and won  
    than womens are <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  i think it well my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  then let thy love be younger than thyself
    or thy affection cannot hold the bent
    for women are as roses whose fair flowr
    being once displayd doth fall that very hour <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  and so they are alas that they are so
    to die even when they to perfection grow

                  reenter curio and clown

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  o fellow come the song we had last night <SENTENCE-END>

    and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
    do use to chant it it is silly sooth
    and dallies with the innocence of love
    like the old age <SENTENCE-END> 
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  are you ready sir

            come away come away death
          and in sad cypress let me be laid
            fly away fly away breath
          i am slain by a fair cruel maid <SENTENCE-END> 
          my shroud of white stuck all with yew
                 o prepare it
          my part of death no one so true
                 did share it <SENTENCE-END> 

            not a flower not a flower sweet
          on my black coffin let there be strown
            not a friend not a friend greet
          my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
          a thousand thousand to save
                 lay me o where
          sad true lover never find my grave
                 to weep there

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  give me now leave to leave thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy
    doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal <SENTENCE-END>  i
    would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business
    might be everything and their intent everywhere for thats it
    that always makes a good voyage of nothing <SENTENCE-END>  farewell <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                      exit clown

    tell her i hold as giddily as fortune  
    but tis that miracle and queen of gems
    that nature pranks her in attracts my soul <SENTENCE-END>

    hath for your love as great a pang of heart
    as you have for olivia <SENTENCE-END>  you cannot love her
    you tell her so <SENTENCE-END>  must she not then be answerd
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  there is no womans sides
    can bide the beating of so strong a passion
    as love doth give my heart no womans heart
    so big to hold so much they lack retention <SENTENCE-END> 
    alas their love may be calld appetite
    no motion of the liver but the palate
    that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
    but mine is all as hungry as the sea
    and can digest as much <SENTENCE-END>  make no compare
    between that love a woman can bear me
    and that i owe olivia <SENTENCE-END>   
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  ay but i know
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  what dost thou know
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  too well what love women to men may owe <SENTENCE-END>

    my father had a daughter lovd a man
    as it might be perhaps were i a woman
    i should your lordship <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  and whats her history
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  a blank my lord <SENTENCE-END>  she never told her love
    but let concealment like a worm i th bud

    and with a green and yellow melancholy
    she sat like patience on a monument
    smiling at grief <SENTENCE-END>  was not this love indeed
    we men may say more swear more but indeed
    our shows are more than will for still we prove
    much in our vows but little in our love <SENTENCE-END>

    chevril glove to a good wit <SENTENCE-END>  how quickly the wrong side may be
    turnd outward
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  nay thats certain they that dally nicely with words may
    quickly make them wanton <SENTENCE-END> 
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  i would therefore my sister had had name sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  why man
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  why sir her names a word and to dally with that word  
    might make my sister wanton <SENTENCE-END>  but indeed words are very rascals
    since bonds disgracd them <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  thy reason man
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  troth sir i can yield you none without words and words
    are grown so false i am loath to prove reason with them <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carst for nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  not so sir i do care for something but in my conscience
    sir i do not care for you <SENTENCE-END>  if that be to care for nothing sir
    i would it would make you invisible <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  art not thou the lady olivias fool
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she will keep
    no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands
    as pilchers are to herrings the husbands the bigger <SENTENCE-END>  i am
    indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  i saw thee late at the count orsinos <SENTENCE-END> 
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun it
    shines everywhere <SENTENCE-END>  i would be sorry sir but the fool should be
    as oft with your master as with my mistress think i saw your
    wisdom there <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  nay an thou pass upon me ill no more with thee <SENTENCE-END>   
    hold theres expenses for thee <SENTENCE-END>              giving a coin
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  now jove in his next commodity of hair send the a beard
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  by my troth ill tell thee i am almost sick for one
    aside though i would not have it grow on my chin <SENTENCE-END>  is thy lady
    within
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  would not a pair of these have bred sir
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  yes being kept together and put to use <SENTENCE-END> 
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring a
    cressida to this troilus <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  i understand you sir tis well beggd <SENTENCE-END> 
                                           giving another coin

    cressida was a beggar <SENTENCE-END>  my lady is within sir <SENTENCE-END>  i will construe to
    them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of
    my welkin i might say element but the word is overworn <SENTENCE-END> 
                                                      exit clown
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  this fellow is wise enough to play the fool
    and to do that well craves a kind of wit <SENTENCE-END> 
    he must observe their mood on whom he jests
    the quality of persons and the time  
    and like the haggard check at every feather
    that comes before his eye <SENTENCE-END>  this is a practice
    as full of labour as a wise mans art
    for folly that he wisely shows is fit
    but wise men follyfalln quite taint their wit <SENTENCE-END> 

                enter sir toby and sir andrew

    voyage <SENTENCE-END>

  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  o by your leave i pray you
    i bade you never speak again of him
    but would you undertake another suit

    than music from the spheres <SENTENCE-END> 
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  dear lady
  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  give me leave beseech you <SENTENCE-END>  i did send
    after the last enchantment you did here
    a ring in chase of you so did i abuse
    myself my servant and i fear me you <SENTENCE-END> 
    under your hard construction must i sit
    to force that on you in a shameful cunning
    which you knew none of yours <SENTENCE-END>  what might you think
    have you not set mine honour at the stake  
    and baited it with all th unmuzzled thoughts

  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  why then methinks tis time to smile again <SENTENCE-END> 
    o world how apt the poor are to be proud
    if one should be a prey how much the better
    to fall before the lion than the wolf       clock strikes
    the clock upbraids me with the waste of time <SENTENCE-END> 
    be not afraid good youth i will not have you
    and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest

  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  o what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
    in the contempt and anger of his lip
    a murdrous guilt shows not itself more soon
    than love that would seem hid loves night is noon <SENTENCE-END> 
    cesario by the roses of the spring
    by maidhood honour truth and every thing
    i love thee so that maugre all thy pride
    nor wit nor reason can my passion hide <SENTENCE-END> 
    do not extort thy reasons from this clause
    for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause
    but rather reason thus with reason fetter
    love sought is good but given unsought is better <SENTENCE-END>   
  viola <SENTENCE-END>  by innocence i swear and by my youth
    i have one heart one bosom and one truth
    and that no woman has nor never none
    shall mistress be of it save i alone <SENTENCE-END> 
    and so adieu good madam never more
    will i my masters tears to you deplore <SENTENCE-END>

  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  i could not stay behind you my desire
    more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
    and not all love to see you though so much
    as might have drawn one to a longer voyage
    but jealousy what might befall your travel
    being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
    unguided and unfriended often prove
    rough and unhospitable <SENTENCE-END>  my willing love
    the rather by these arguments of fear
    set forth in your pursuit <SENTENCE-END> 
  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  my kind antonio
    i can no other answer make but thanks

  sebastian <SENTENCE-END>  belike you slew great number of his people <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END> th offence is not of such a bloody nature
    albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
    might well have given us bloody argument <SENTENCE-END>

    for though my soul disputes well with my sense
    that this may be some error but no madness
    yet doth this accident and flood of fortune

    that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
    and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
    to any other trust but that i am mad
    or else the ladys mad yet if twere so

    as black as vulcan in the smoke of war <SENTENCE-END> 
    a baubling vessel was he captain of
    for shallow draught and bulk unprizable
    with which such scathful grapple did he make
    with the most noble bottom of our fleet

    cried fame and honour on him <SENTENCE-END>  whats the matter
  first officer <SENTENCE-END>  orsino this is that antonio
    that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy
    and this is he that did the tiger board

    his life i gave him and did thereto ad
    my love without retention or restraint
    all his in dedication for his sake
    did i expose myself pure for his love
    into the danger of this adverse town
    drew to defend him when he was beset
    where being apprehended his false cunning
    not meaning to partake with me in danger
    taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
    and grew a twenty years removed thing
    while one would wink denied me mine own purse
    which i had recommended to his use
    not half an hour before <SENTENCE-END>

    you must not now deny it is your hand
    write from it if you can in hand or phrase
    or say tis not your seal not your invention
    you can say none of this <SENTENCE-END>  well grant it then
    and tell me in the modesty of honour
    why you have given me such clear lights of favour
    bade me come smiling and crossgarterd to you
    to put on yellow stockings and to frown
    upon sir toby and the lighter people
    and acting this in an obedient hope
    why have you sufferd me to be imprisond
    kept in a dark house visited by the priest
    and made the most notorious geck and gul
    that eer invention playd on tell me why <SENTENCE-END> 
  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  alas malvolio this is not my writing
    though i confess much like the character  
    but out of question tis marias hand <SENTENCE-END>

    first told me thou wast mad then camst in smiling
    and in such forms which here were presupposd
    upon thee in the letter <SENTENCE-END>  prithee be content
    this practice hath most shrewdly passd upon thee
    but when we know the grounds and authors of it
    thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
    of thine own cause <SENTENCE-END> 
  fabian <SENTENCE-END>  good madam hear me speak
    and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
    taint the condition of this present hour
    which i have wondred at <SENTENCE-END>  in hope it shall not
    most freely i confess myself and toby
    set this device against malvolio here
    upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
    we had conceivd against him <SENTENCE-END>  maria writ
    the letter at sir tobys great importance
    in recompense whereof he hath married her <SENTENCE-END> 
    how with a sportful malice it was followd  
    may rather pluck on laughter than revenge
    if that the injuries be justly weighd
    that have on both sides passd <SENTENCE-END> 
  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  alas poor fool how have they baffld thee
  clown <SENTENCE-END>  why some are born great some achieve greatness and some
    have greatness thrown upon them <SENTENCE-END>  i was one sir in this
    interlude one sir topas sir but thats all one <SENTENCE-END>  by the lord
    fool i am not mad but do you remember madam why laugh you
    at such a barren rascal an you smile not hes gaggd and thus
    the whirligig of time brings in his revenges <SENTENCE-END> 
  malvolio <SENTENCE-END>  ill be revengd on the whole pack of you <SENTENCE-END> 
 exit
  olivia <SENTENCE-END>  he hath been most notoriously abusd <SENTENCE-END>

    of our dear souls <SENTENCE-END>  meantime sweet sister
    we will not part from hence <SENTENCE-END>  cesario come
    for so you shall be while you are a man  
    but when in other habits you are seen

                        clown sings

           when that i was and a little tiny boy
             with hey ho the wind and the rain
           a foolish thing was but a toy
             for the rain it raineth every day <SENTENCE-END> 

           but when i came to mans estate
             with hey ho the wind and the rain
           gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
             for the rain it raineth every day <SENTENCE-END> 

           but when i came alas to wive
             with hey ho the wind and the rain
           by swaggering could i never thrive
             for the rain it raineth every day <SENTENCE-END>   

           but when i came unto my beds
             with hey ho the wind and the rain
           with tosspots still had drunken heads
             for the rain it raineth every day <SENTENCE-END> 

           a great while ago the world begun
             with hey ho the wind and the rain

verona milan the frontiers of mantua


act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
verona <SENTENCE-END>  an open place

enter valentine and proteus

  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  cease to persuade my loving proteus
    homekeeping youth have ever homely wits <SENTENCE-END> 
    weret not affection chains thy tender days
    to the sweet glances of thy honourd love
    i rather would entreat thy company
    to see the wonders of the world abroad
    than living dully sluggardizd at home
    wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness <SENTENCE-END> 
    but since thou lovst love still and thrive therein
    even as i would when i to love begin <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  wilt thou be gone sweet valentine adieu
    think on thy proteus when thou haply seest
    some rare noteworthy object in thy travel <SENTENCE-END> 
    wish me partaker in thy happiness
    when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
    if ever danger do environ thee
    commend thy grievance to my holy prayers  
    for i will be thy headsman valentine <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  and on a lovebook pray for my success
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  upon some book i love ill pray for thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  thats on some shallow story of deep love
    how young leander crossd the hellespont <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  thats a deep story of a deeper love
    for he was more than over shoes in love <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  tis true for you are over boots in love
    and yet you never swum the hellespont <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  over the boots nay give me not the boots <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  no i will not for it boots thee not <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  what
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  to be in love where scorn is bought with groans
    coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth
    with twenty watchful weary tedious nights
    if haply won perhaps a hapless gain
    if lost why then a grievous labour won
    however but a folly bought with wit
    or else a wit by folly vanquished <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  so by your circumstance you call me fool <SENTENCE-END>   
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  so by your circumstance i fear youll prove <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  tis love you cavil at i am not love <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  love is your master for he masters you
    and he that is so yoked by a fool
    methinks should not be chronicled for wise <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
    the eating canker dwells so eating love
    inhabits in the finest wits of all <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  and writers say as the most forward bud
    is eaten by the canker ere it blow
    even so by love the young and tender wit
    is turnd to folly blasting in the bud
    losing his verdure even in the prime
    and all the fair effects of future hopes <SENTENCE-END> 
    but wherefore waste i time to counsel the
    that art a votary to fond desire
    once more adieu <SENTENCE-END>  my father at the road
    expects my coming there to see me shippd <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  and thither will i bring thee valentine <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  sweet proteus no now let us take our leave <SENTENCE-END>   
    to milan let me hear from thee by letters
    of thy success in love and what news else
    betideth here in absence of thy friend
    and i likewise will visit thee with mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  all happiness bechance to thee in milan
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  as much to you at home and so farewell
                                                  exit valentine
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  he after honour hunts i after love
    he leaves his friends to dignify them more
    i leave myself my friends and all for love <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou julia thou hast metamorphisd me
    made me neglect my studies lose my time
    war with good counsel set the world at nought
    made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought <SENTENCE-END> 

                         enter speed

  speed <SENTENCE-END>  sir proteus save you saw you my master
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  but now he parted hence to embark for milan <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  twenty to one then he is shippd already  
    and i have playd the sheep in losing him <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  indeed a sheep doth very often stray
    an if the shepherd be awhile away <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and
    i a sheep
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  i do <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  a silly answer and fitting well a sheep <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  this proves me still a sheep <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  true and thy master a shepherd <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  nay that i can deny by a circumstance <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  it shall go hard but ill prove it by another <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
    shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me
    therefore i am no sheep <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for
    food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master
    thy master for wages follows not thee <SENTENCE-END>  therefore thou art a
    sheep <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  such another proof will make me cry baa <SENTENCE-END>   
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  but dost thou hear gavst thou my letter to julia
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a lacd
    mutton and she a lacd mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing
    for my labour <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  heres too small a pasture for such store of muttons <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  if the ground be overchargd you were best stick her <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  nay in that you are astray twere best pound you <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
    letter <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold <SENTENCE-END> 
  speed <SENTENCE-END>  from a pound to a pin fold it over and over
    tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  but what said she

  julia <SENTENCE-END>  how now what means this passion at his name
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  pardon dear madam tis a passing shame  
    that i unworthy body as i am
    should censure thus on lovely gentlemen <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  why not on proteus as of all the rest
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  then thus of many good i think him best <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  your reason
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  i have no other but a womans reason
    i think him so because i think him so <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  ay if you thought your love not cast away <SENTENCE-END>

  julia <SENTENCE-END>  his little speaking shows his love but small <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  fire thats closest kept burns most of all <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  they do not love that do not show their love <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  o they love least that let men know their love <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  i would i knew his mind <SENTENCE-END>

  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  sir valentines page and sent i think from proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
    he would have given it you but i being in the way
    did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  now by my modesty a goodly broker
    dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
    to whisper and conspire against my youth
    now trust me tis an office of great worth
    and you an officer fit for the place <SENTENCE-END> 
    there take the paper see it be returnd
    or else return no more into my sight <SENTENCE-END>

  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  that you may ruminate <SENTENCE-END>                            exit
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  and yet i would i had oerlookd the letter <SENTENCE-END> 
    it were a shame to call her back again
    and pray her to a fault for which i chid her <SENTENCE-END> 
    what fool is she that knows i am a maid
    and would not force the letter to my view
    since maids in modesty say no to that
    which they would have the profferer construe ay <SENTENCE-END>   
    fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
    that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
    and presently all humbled kiss the rod
    how churlishly i chid lucetta hence
    when willingly i would have had her here
    how angerly i taught my brow to frown
    when inward joy enforcd my heart to smile
    my penance is to call lucetta back
    and ask remission for my folly past <SENTENCE-END> 
    what ho lucetta

                     reenter lucetta

  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  what would your ladyship

  julia <SENTENCE-END>  what ist that you took up so gingerly
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  nothing <SENTENCE-END>   
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  why didst thou stoop then
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  to take a paper up that i let fall <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  and is that paper nothing
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  nothing concerning me <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  then let it lie for those that it concerns <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  madam it will not lie where it concerns
    unless it have a false interpreter <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  that i might sing it madam to a tune <SENTENCE-END>

  julia <SENTENCE-END>  you minion are too saucy <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  nay now you are too flat
    and mar the concord with too harsh a descant
    there wanteth but a mean to fill your song <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  the mean is drownd with your unruly bass <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  indeed i bid the base for proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  this babble shall not henceforth trouble me <SENTENCE-END> 
    here is a coil with protestation         tears the letter
    go get you gone and let the papers lie <SENTENCE-END> 
    you would be fingring them to anger me <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  she makes it strange but she would be best pleasd
    to be so angred with another letter <SENTENCE-END>                    exit
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  nay would i were so angred with the same
    o hateful hands to tear such loving words
    injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
    and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
    ill kiss each several paper for amends <SENTENCE-END>   
    look here is writ kind julia <SENTENCE-END>  unkind julia
    as in revenge of thy ingratitude
    i throw thy name against the bruising stones
    trampling contemptuously on thy disdain <SENTENCE-END> 
    and here is writ lovewounded proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
    poor wounded name my bosomas a bed
    shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heald
    and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss <SENTENCE-END> 
    but twice or thrice was proteus written down <SENTENCE-END> 
    be calm good wind blow not a word away
    till i have found each letter in the letter
    except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
    unto a ragged fearful hanging rock
    and throw it thence into the raging sea <SENTENCE-END> 
    lo here in one line is his name twice writ
    poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus
    to the sweet julia <SENTENCE-END>  that ill tear away
    and yet i will not sith so prettily
    he couples it to his complaining names <SENTENCE-END> 
    thus will i fold them one upon another  
    now kiss embrace contend do what you will <SENTENCE-END>

  panthino <SENTENCE-END>  twas of his nephew proteus your son <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  why what of him
  panthino <SENTENCE-END>  he wondred that your lordship
    would suffer him to spend his youth at home
    while other men of slender reputation
    put forth their sons to seek preferment out
    some to the wars to try their fortune there
    some to discover islands far away
    some to the studious universities <SENTENCE-END> 
    for any or for all these exercises
    he said that proteus your son was meet
    and did request me to importune you
    to let him spend his time no more at home
    which would be great impeachment to his age
    in having known no travel in his youth <SENTENCE-END>   
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  nor needst thou much importune me to that
    whereon this month i have been hammering <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have considerd well his loss of time
    and how he cannot be a perfect man

    experience is by industry achievd
    and perfected by the swift course of time <SENTENCE-END> 
    then tell me whither were i best to send him <SENTENCE-END>

    and daily graced by the emperor
    wishing me with him partner of his fortune <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  and how stand you affected to his wish
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  as one relying on your lordships will
    and not depending on his friendly wish <SENTENCE-END> 
  antonio <SENTENCE-END>  my will is something sorted with his wish <SENTENCE-END> 
    muse not that i thus suddenly proceed
    for what i will i will and there an end <SENTENCE-END>

    with valentinus in the emperors court

    lest he should take exceptions to my love
    and with the vantage of mine own excuse
    hath he excepted most against my love <SENTENCE-END> 
    o how this spring of love resembleth
    the uncertain glory of an april day
    which now shows all the beauty of the sun
    and by an by a cloud takes all away

    lovesong like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that
    had the pestilence to sigh like a schoolboy that had lost his
    a b c to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam
    to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears

  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  i left them all in health <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  how does your lady and how thrives your love
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  my tales of love were wont to weary you
    i know you joy not in a lovediscourse <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  ay proteus but that life is alterd now
    i have done penance for contemning love
    whose high imperious thoughts have punishd me
    with bitter fasts with penitential groans  
    with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs
    for in revenge of my contempt of love
    love hath chasd sleep from my enthralled eyes
    and made them watchers of mine own hearts sorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
    o gentle proteus loves a mighty lord
    and hath so humbled me as i confess
    there is no woe to his correction
    nor to his service no such joy on earth <SENTENCE-END> 
    now no discourse except it be of love
    now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep
    upon the very naked name of love <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  enough i read your fortune in your eye <SENTENCE-END> 
    was this the idol that you worship so
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  even she and is she not a heavenly saint
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  no but she is an earthly paragon <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  call her divine <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  i will not flatter her <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  o flatter me for love delights in praises
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  when i was sick you gave me bitter pills
    and i must minister the like to you <SENTENCE-END>   
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  then speak the truth by her if not divine
    yet let her be a principality
    sovereign to all the creatures on the earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  except my mistress <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  sweet except not any
    except thou wilt except against my love <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  have i not reason to prefer mine own
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  and i will help thee to prefer her too
    she shall be dignified with this high honour
    to bear my ladys train lest the base earth
    should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
    and of so great a favour growing proud
    disdain to root the summerswelling flowr
    and make rough winter everlastingly <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  why valentine what braggardism is this
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  pardon me proteus all i can is nothing
    to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
    she is alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  then let her alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  not for the world why man she is mine own  
    and i as rich in having such a jewel
    as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
    the water nectar and the rocks pure gold <SENTENCE-END> 
    forgive me that i do not dream on thee
    because thou seest me dote upon my love <SENTENCE-END> 
    my foolish rival that her father likes
    only for his possessions are so huge
    is gone with her along and i must after
    for love thou knowst is full of jealousy <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  but she loves you
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  ay and we are betrothd nay more our marriagehour
    with all the cunning manner of our flight
    determind of how i must climb her window
    the ladder made of cords and all the means
    plotted and greed on for my happiness <SENTENCE-END> 
    good proteus go with me to my chamber
    in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  go on before i shall enquire you forth
    i must unto the road to disembark
    some necessaries that i needs must use  
    and then ill presently attend you <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  will you make haste
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  i will <SENTENCE-END>                                 exit valentine
    even as one heat another heat expels
    or as one nail by strength drives out another
    so the remembrance of my former love
    is by a newer object quite forgotten <SENTENCE-END> 
    is it my mind or valentinus praise
    her true perfection or my false transgression
    that makes me reasonless to reason thus
    she is fair and so is julia that i love
    that i did love for now my love is thawd
    which like a waxen image gainst a fire
    bears no impression of the thing it was <SENTENCE-END> 
    methinks my zeal to valentine is cold
    and that i love him not as i was wont <SENTENCE-END> 
    o but i love his lady too too much
    and thats the reason i love him so little <SENTENCE-END> 
    how shall i dote on her with more advice
    that thus without advice begin to love her  
    tis but her picture i have yet beheld
    and that hath dazzled my reasons light
    but when i look on her perfections
    there is no reason but i shall be blind <SENTENCE-END> 
    if i can check my erring love i will
    if not to compass her ill use my skill <SENTENCE-END>                exit

enter proteus

  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  to leave my julia shall i be forsworn
    to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn
    to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn
    and evn that powr which gave me first my oath
    provokes me to this threefold perjury
    love bade me swear and love bids me forswear <SENTENCE-END> 
    o sweetsuggesting love if thou hast sinnd
    teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
    at first i did adore a twinkling star
    but now i worship a celestial sun <SENTENCE-END> 
    unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
    and he wants wit that wants resolved will
    to learn his wit t exchange the bad for better <SENTENCE-END> 
    fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
    whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferrd
    with twenty thousand soulconfirming oaths
    i cannot leave to love and yet i do  
    but there i leave to love where i should love <SENTENCE-END> 
    julia i lose and valentine i lose
    if i keep them i needs must lose myself
    if i lose them thus find i by their loss
    for valentine myself for julia silvia <SENTENCE-END> 
    i to myself am dearer than a friend
    for love is still most precious in itself
    and silvia witness heaven that made her fair
    shows julia but a swarthy ethiope <SENTENCE-END> 
    i will forget that julia is alive
    remembring that my love to her is dead
    and valentine ill hold an enemy
    aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend <SENTENCE-END> 
    i cannot now prove constant to myself
    without some treachery usd to valentine <SENTENCE-END> 
    this night he meaneth with a corded ladder
    to climb celestial silvias chamber window
    myself in counsel his competitor <SENTENCE-END> 
    now presently ill give her father notice
    of their disguising and pretended flight  
    who all enragd will banish valentine
    for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
    but valentine being gone ill quickly cross
    by some sly trick blunt thurios dull proceeding <SENTENCE-END> 
    love lend me wings to make my purpose swift
    as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift <SENTENCE-END>             exit




scene vii <SENTENCE-END> 
verona <SENTENCE-END>  julias house

enter julia and lucetta

  julia <SENTENCE-END>  counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me
    and evn in kind love i do conjure thee
    who art the table wherein all my thoughts
    are visibly characterd and engravd
    to lesson me and tell me some good mean
    how with my honour i may undertake
    a journey to my loving proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  alas the way is wearisome and long
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  a truedevoted pilgrim is not weary
    to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
    much less shall she that hath loves wings to fly
    and when the flight is made to one so dear
    of such divine perfection as sir proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  better forbear till proteus make return <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  o knowst thou not his looks are my souls food
    pity the dearth that i have pined in
    by longing for that food so long a time <SENTENCE-END>   
    didst thou but know the inly touch of love <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
    as seek to quench the fire of love with words <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  i do not seek to quench your loves hot fire
    but qualify the fires extreme rage
    lest it should burn above the bounds of reason <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  the more thou damst it up the more it burns <SENTENCE-END> 
    the current that with gentle murmur glides
    thou knowst being stoppd impatiently doth rage
    but when his fair course is not hindered
    he makes sweet music with th enamelld stones
    giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
    he overtaketh in his pilgrimage
    and so by many winding nooks he strays
    with willing sport to the wild ocean <SENTENCE-END> 
    then let me go and hinder not my course <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill be as patient as a gentle stream
    and make a pastime of each weary step
    till the last step have brought me to my love
    and there ill rest as after much turmoil  
    a blessed soul doth in elysium <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  but in what habit will you go along
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  not like a woman for i would prevent
    the loose encounters of lascivious men
    gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds
    as may beseem some wellreputed page <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  why then your ladyship must cut your hair <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  no girl ill knit it up in silken strings
    with twenty oddconceited truelove knots
    to be fantastic may become a youth
    of greater time than i shall show to be <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  what fashion madam shall i make your breeches
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  that fits as well as tell me good my lord
    what compass will you wear your farthingale <SENTENCE-END> 
    why evn what fashion thou best likes lucetta <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  you must needs have them with a codpiece madam <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  out out lucetta that will be illfavourd <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  a round hose madam nows not worth a pin
    unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  lucetta as thou lovst me let me have  
    what thou thinkst meet and is most mannerly <SENTENCE-END> 
    but tell me wench how will the world repute me
    for undertaking so unstaid a journey
    i fear me it will make me scandalizd <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  if you think so then stay at home and go not <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  nay that i will not <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  then never dream on infamy but go <SENTENCE-END> 
    if proteus like your journey when you come
    no matter whos displeasd when you are gone <SENTENCE-END> 
    i fear me he will scarce be pleasd withal <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  that is the least lucetta of my fear
    a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
    and instances of infinite of love
    warrant me welcome to my proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  all these are servants to deceitful men <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  base men that use them to so base effect
    but truer stars did govern proteus birth
    his words are bonds his oaths are oracles
    his love sincere his thoughts immaculate
    his tears pure messengers sent from his heart  
    his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth <SENTENCE-END> 
  lucetta <SENTENCE-END>  pray heavn he prove so when you come to him <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  now as thou lovst me do him not that wrong
    to bear a hard opinion of his truth
    only deserve my love by loving him <SENTENCE-END> 
    and presently go with me to my chamber
    to take a note of what i stand in need of
    to furnish me upon my longing journey <SENTENCE-END> 
    all that is mine i leave at thy dispose
    my goods my lands my reputation
    only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence <SENTENCE-END> 
    come answer not but to it presently
    i am impatient of my tarriance <SENTENCE-END>                        exeunt

act iii <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
milan <SENTENCE-END>  the dukes palace

enter duke thurio and proteus

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile
    we have some secrets to confer about <SENTENCE-END>             exit thurio
    now tell me proteus whats your will with me
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious lord that which i would discover
    the law of friendship bids me to conceal
    but when i call to mind your gracious favours
    done to me undeserving as i am
    my duty pricks me on to utter that
    which else no worldly good should draw from me <SENTENCE-END> 
    know worthy prince sir valentine my friend
    this night intends to steal away your daughter
    myself am one made privy to the plot <SENTENCE-END> 
    i know you have determind to bestow her
    on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
    and should she thus be stoln away from you
    it would be much vexation to your age <SENTENCE-END> 
    thus for my dutys sake i rather chose  
    to cross my friend in his intended drift
    than by concealing it heap on your head
    a pack of sorrows which would press you down
    being unprevented to your timeless grave <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  proteus i thank thee for thine honest care
    which to requite command me while i live <SENTENCE-END> 
    this love of theirs myself have often seen
    haply when they have judgd me fast asleep
    and oftentimes have purposd to forbid
    sir valentine her company and my court
    but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
    and so unworthily disgrace the man
    a rashness that i ever yet have shunnd
    i gave him gentle looks thereby to find
    that which thyself hast now disclosd to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
    knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
    i nightly lodge her in an upper towr
    the key whereof myself have ever kept
    and thence she cannot be conveyd away <SENTENCE-END>   
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  know noble lord they have devisd a mean
    how he her chamber window will ascend
    and with a corded ladder fetch her down
    for which the youthful lover now is gone
    and this way comes he with it presently
    where if it please you you may intercept him <SENTENCE-END> 
    but good my lord do it so cunningly
    that my discovery be not aimed at
    for love of you not hate unto my friend
    hath made me publisher of this pretence <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  upon mine honour he shall never know
    that i had any light from thee of this <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  adieu my lord sir valentine is coming <SENTENCE-END>          exit

                        enter valentine

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  sir valentine whither away so fast
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  please it your grace there is a messenger
    that stays to bear my letters to my friends
    and i am going to deliver them <SENTENCE-END>   
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  be they of much import
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  the tenour of them doth but signify
    my health and happy being at your court <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  nay then no matter stay with me awhile
    i am to break with thee of some affairs
    that touch me near wherein thou must be secret <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis not unknown to thee that i have sought
    to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  i know it well my lord and sure the match
    were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
    is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
    beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
    cannot your grace win her to fancy him
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  no trust me she is peevish sullen froward
    proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
    neither regarding that she is my child
    nor fearing me as if i were her father
    and may i say to thee this pride of hers
    upon advice hath drawn my love from her
    and where i thought the remnant of mine age  
    should have been cherishd by her childlike duty
    i now am full resolvd to take a wife
    and turn her out to who will take her in <SENTENCE-END> 
    then let her beauty be her weddingdowr
    for me and my possessions she esteems not <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  what would your grace have me to do in this
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  there is a lady in verona here
    whom i affect but she is nice and coy
    and nought esteems my aged eloquence <SENTENCE-END> 
    now therefore would i have thee to my tutor
    for long agone i have forgot to court
    besides the fashion of the time is changd
    how and which way i may bestow myself
    to be regarded in her sunbright eye <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  win her with gifts if she respect not words
    dumb jewels often in their silent kind
    more than quick words do move a womans mind <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  but she did scorn a present that i sent her <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  a woman sometime scorns what best contents her <SENTENCE-END> 
    send her another never give her oer  
    for scorn at first makes afterlove the more <SENTENCE-END> 
    if she do frown tis not in hate of you
    but rather to beget more love in you
    if she do chide tis not to have you gone
    for why the fools are mad if left alone <SENTENCE-END> 
    take no repulse whatever she doth say
    for get you gone she doth not mean away
    flatter and praise commend extol their graces
    though neer so black say they have angels faces <SENTENCE-END> 
    that man that hath a tongue i say is no man
    if with his tongue he cannot win a woman <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  but she i mean is promisd by her friends
    unto a youthful gentleman of worth
    and kept severely from resort of men
    that no man hath access by day to her <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  why then i would resort to her by night <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  ay but the doors be lockd and keys kept safe
    that no man hath recourse to her by night <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  what lets but one may enter at her window
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  her chamber is aloft far from the ground  
    and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
    without apparent hazard of his life <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
    to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
    would serve to scale another heros towr
    so bold leander would adventure it <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  now as thou art a gentleman of blood
    advise me where i may have such a ladder <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  when would you use it pray sir tell me that <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  this very night for love is like a child
    that longs for everything that he can come by <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  by seven oclock ill get you such a ladder <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  but hark thee i will go to her alone
    how shall i best convey the ladder thither
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  it will be light my lord that you may bear it
    under a cloak that is of any length <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  ay my good lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  then let me see thy cloak <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill get me one of such another length <SENTENCE-END>   
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  why any cloak will serve the turn my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak
    i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me <SENTENCE-END> 
    what letter is this same whats here to silvia
    and here an engine fit for my proceeding
    ill be so bold to break the seal for once <SENTENCE-END>           reads
      my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly
        and slaves they are to me that send them flying <SENTENCE-END> 
      o could their master come and go as lightly
        himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
      my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
        while i their king that thither them importune
      do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them
        because myself do want my servants fortune <SENTENCE-END> 
      i curse myself for they are sent by me
        that they should harbour where their lord should be <SENTENCE-END> 
    whats here
      silvia this night i will enfranchise thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    tis so and heres the ladder for the purpose <SENTENCE-END> 
    why phaethon for thou art merops son  
    wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
    and with thy daring folly burn the world
    wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
    go base intruder overweening slave
    bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
    and think my patience more than thy desert
    is privilege for thy departure hence <SENTENCE-END> 
    thank me for this more than for all the favours
    which all too much i have bestowd on thee <SENTENCE-END> 
    but if thou linger in my territories
    longer than swiftest expedition
    will give thee time to leave our royal court
    by heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
    i ever bore my daughter or thyself <SENTENCE-END> 
    be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse
    but as thou lovst thy life make speed from hence <SENTENCE-END>     exit
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  and why not death rather than living torment
    to die is to be banishd from myself
    and silvia is myself banishd from her
    is self from self a deadly banishment <SENTENCE-END>   
    what light is light if silvia be not seen
    what joy is joy if silvia be not by
    unless it be to think that she is by
    and feed upon the shadow of perfection <SENTENCE-END> 
    except i be by silvia in the night
    there is no music in the nightingale
    unless i look on silvia in the day
    there is no day for me to look upon <SENTENCE-END> 
    she is my essence and i leave to be
    if i be not by her fair influence
    fosterd illumind cherishd kept alive <SENTENCE-END> 
    i fly not death to fly his deadly doom
    tarry i here i but attend on death
    but fly i hence i fly away from life <SENTENCE-END>

    doth silvia know that i am banished
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  ay ay and she hath offered to the doom
    which unreversd stands in effectual force
    a sea of melting pearl which some call tears
    those at her fathers churlish feet she tenderd
    with them upon her knees her humble self
    wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
    as if but now they waxed pale for woe <SENTENCE-END> 
    but neither bended knees pure hands held up
    sad sighs deep groans nor silvershedding tears  
    could penetrate her uncompassionate sire
    but valentine if he be taen must die <SENTENCE-END> 
    besides her intercession chafd him so
    when she for thy repeal was suppliant
    that to close prison he commanded her
    with many bitter threats of biding there <SENTENCE-END>

scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
milan <SENTENCE-END>  the dukes palace

enter duke and thurio

  duke <SENTENCE-END>  sir thurio fear not but that she will love you
    now valentine is banishd from her sight <SENTENCE-END> 
  thurio <SENTENCE-END>  since his exile she hath despisd me most
    forsworn my company and raild at me
    that i am desperate of obtaining her <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  this weak impress of love is as a figure
    trenched in ice which with an hours heat
    dissolves to water and doth lose his form <SENTENCE-END> 
    a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
    and worthless valentine shall be forgot <SENTENCE-END> 

                          enter proteus

    how now sir proteus is your countryman
    according to our proclamation gone
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  gone my good lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  my daughter takes his going grievously <SENTENCE-END>   
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  a little time my lord will kill that grief <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  so i believe but thurio thinks not so <SENTENCE-END> 
    proteus the good conceit i hold of thee
    for thou hast shown some sign of good desert
    makes me the better to confer with thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  longer than i prove loyal to your grace
    let me not live to look upon your grace <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  thou knowst how willingly i would effect
    the match between sir thurio and my daughter <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  i do my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  and also i think thou art not ignorant
    how she opposes her against my will <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  she did my lord when valentine was here <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  ay and perversely she persevers so <SENTENCE-END> 
    what might we do to make the girl forget
    the love of valentine and love sir thurio
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  the best way is to slander valentine
    with falsehood cowardice and poor descent
    three things that women highly hold in hate <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  ay but shell think that it is spoke in hate <SENTENCE-END>   
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  ay if his enemy deliver it
    therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
    by one whom she esteemeth as his friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  then you must undertake to slander him <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  and that my lord i shall be loath to do
    tis an ill office for a gentleman
    especially against his very friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  where your good word cannot advantage him
    your slander never can endamage him
    therefore the office is indifferent
    being entreated to it by your friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  you have prevaild my lord if i can do it
    by aught that i can speak in his dispraise
    she shall not long continue love to him <SENTENCE-END> 
    but say this weed her love from valentine
    it follows not that she will love sir thurio <SENTENCE-END> 
  thurio <SENTENCE-END>  therefore as you unwind her love from him
    lest it should ravel and be good to none
    you must provide to bottom it on me
    which must be done by praising me as much  
    as you in worth dispraise sir valentine <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  and proteus we dare trust you in this kind
    because we know on valentines report
    you are already loves firm votary
    and cannot soon revolt and change your mind <SENTENCE-END> 
    upon this warrant shall you have access
    where you with silvia may confer at large
    for she is lumpish heavy melancholy
    and for your friends sake will be glad of you
    where you may temper her by your persuasion
    to hate young valentine and love my friend <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  as much as i can do i will effect <SENTENCE-END> 
    but you sir thurio are not sharp enough
    you must lay lime to tangle her desires
    by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
    should be fullfraught with serviceable vows <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  ay
    much is the force of heavenbred poesy <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  say that upon the altar of her beauty
    you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart  
    write till your ink be dry and with your tears
    moist it again and frame some feeling line
    that may discover such integrity
    for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews
    whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
    make tigers tame and huge leviathans
    forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands <SENTENCE-END> 
    after your direlamenting elegies
    visit by night your ladys chamber window
    with some sweet consort to their instruments
    tune a deploring dump the nights dead silence
    will well become such sweetcomplaining grievance <SENTENCE-END> 
    this or else nothing will inherit her <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  this discipline shows thou hast been in love <SENTENCE-END> 
  thurio <SENTENCE-END>  and thy advice this night ill put in practice
    therefore sweet proteus my directiongiver
    let us into the city presently
    to sort some gentlemen well skilld in music <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have a sonnet that will serve the turn
    to give the onset to thy good advice <SENTENCE-END>   
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  about it gentlemen
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  well wait upon your grace till after supper
    and afterward determine our proceedings <SENTENCE-END> 
  duke <SENTENCE-END>  even now about it i will pardon you <SENTENCE-END>              exeunt

    to be corrupted with my worthless gifts <SENTENCE-END> 
    when i protest true loyalty to her
    she twits me with my falsehood to my friend
    when to her beauty i commend my vows
    she bids me think how i have been forsworn
    in breaking faith with julia whom i lovd
    and notwithstanding all her sudden quips
    the least whereof would quell a lovers hope
    yet spaniellike the more she spurns my love

  julia <SENTENCE-END>  madam he sends your ladyship this ring <SENTENCE-END>

    poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou know her
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  almost as well as i do know myself <SENTENCE-END> 
    to think upon her woes i do protest
    that i have wept a hundred several times <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  i think she doth and thats her cause of sorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  is she not passing fair
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  she hath been fairer madam than she is <SENTENCE-END> 
    when she did think my master lovd her well
    she in my judgment was as fair as you
    but since she did neglect her lookingglass
    and threw her sunexpelling mask away
    the air hath starvd the roses in her cheeks
    and pinchd the lilytincture of her face
    that now she is become as black as i <SENTENCE-END>   
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  how tall was she
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  about my stature for at pentecost
    when all our pageants of delight were playd
    our youth got me to play the womans part
    and i was trimmd in madam julias gown
    which served me as fit by all mens judgments
    as if the garment had been made for me
    therefore i know she is about my height <SENTENCE-END> 
    and at that time i made her weep a good
    for i did play a lamentable part <SENTENCE-END> 
    madam twas ariadne passioning
    for theseus perjury and unjust flight
    which i so lively acted with my tears
    that my poor mistress moved therewithal
    wept bitterly and would i might be dead
    if i in thought felt not her very sorrow <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  she is beholding to thee gentle youth <SENTENCE-END> 
    alas poor lady desolate and left
    i weep myself to think upon thy words <SENTENCE-END> 
    here youth there is my purse i give thee this  
    for thy sweet mistress sake because thou lovst her <SENTENCE-END> 
    farewell <SENTENCE-END>                         exit silvia with attendants
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  and she shall thank you fort if eer you know her <SENTENCE-END> 
    a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
    i hope my masters suit will be but cold
    since she respects my mistress love so much <SENTENCE-END> 
    alas how love can trifle with itself
    here is her picture let me see <SENTENCE-END>  i think
    if i had such a tire this face of mine
    were full as lovely as is this of hers
    and yet the painter flatterd her a little
    unless i flatter with myself too much <SENTENCE-END> 
    her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
    if that be all the difference in his love
    ill get me such a colourd periwig <SENTENCE-END> 
    her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
    ay but her foreheads low and mines as high <SENTENCE-END> 
    what should it be that he respects in her
    but i can make respective in myself
    if this fond love were not a blinded god  
    come shadow come and take this shadow up
    for tis thy rival <SENTENCE-END>  o thou senseless form
    thou shalt be worshippd kissd lovd and adord
    and were there sense in his idolatry
    my substance should be statue in thy stead <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill use thee kindly for thy mistress sake
    that usd me so or else by jove i vow
    i should have scratchd out your unseeing eyes
    to make my master out of love with thee <SENTENCE-END>                 exit

  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  she says it is a fair one <SENTENCE-END> 
  thurio <SENTENCE-END>  nay then the wanton lies my face is black <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  but pearls are fair and the old saying is
    black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>   aside  tis true such pearls as put out ladies eyes
    for i had rather wink than look on them <SENTENCE-END> 
  thurio <SENTENCE-END>  how likes she my discourse
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  ill when you talk of war <SENTENCE-END> 
  thurio <SENTENCE-END>  but well when i discourse of love and peace

    but being maskd he was not sure of it

    these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
    therefore i pray you stand not to discourse

  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  and i will follow more for silvias love
    than hate of eglamour that goes with her <SENTENCE-END>               exit
  julia <SENTENCE-END>  and i will follow more to cross that love
    than hate for silvia that is gone for love <SENTENCE-END>             exit

enter valentine

  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  how use doth breed a habit in a man
    this shadowy desert unfrequented woods
    i better brook than flourishing peopled towns <SENTENCE-END> 
    here can i sit alone unseen of any
    and to the nightingales complaining notes
    tune my distresses and record my woes <SENTENCE-END> 
    o thou that dost inhabit in my breast
    leave not the mansion so long tenantless
    lest growing ruinous the building fall
    and leave no memory of what it was
    repair me with thy presence silvia
    thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain <SENTENCE-END> 
    what halloing and what stir is this today
    these are my mates that make their wills their law
    have some unhappy passenger in chase <SENTENCE-END> 
    they love me well yet i have much to do
    to keep them from uncivil outrages <SENTENCE-END>   
    withdraw thee valentine <SENTENCE-END>  whos this comes here
                                                   steps aside

          enter proteus silvia and julia as sebastian

  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  madam this service i have done for you
    though you respect not aught your servant doth
    to hazard life and rescue you from him
    that would have forcd your honour and your love <SENTENCE-END> 
    vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
    a smaller boon than this i cannot beg
    and less than this i am sure you cannot give <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>   aside  how like a dream is this i see and hear
    love lend me patience to forbear awhile <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  o miserable unhappy that i am
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  unhappy were you madam ere i came
    but by my coming i have made you happy <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  by thy approach thou makst me most unhappy <SENTENCE-END> 
  julia <SENTENCE-END>   aside  and me when he approacheth to your presence <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  had i been seized by a hungry lion  
    i would have been a breakfast to the beast
    rather than have false proteus rescue me <SENTENCE-END> 
    o heaven be judge how i love valentine
    whose lifes as tender to me as my soul
    and full as much for more there cannot be
    i do detest false perjurd proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
    therefore be gone solicit me no more <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  what dangerous action stood it next to death
    would i not undergo for one calm look
    o tis the curse in love and still approvd
    when women cannot love where theyre belovd
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  when proteus cannot love where hes belovd
    read over julias heart thy first best love
    for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
    into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
    descended into perjury to love me <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou hast no faith left now unless thoudst two
    and thats far worse than none better have none
    than plural faith which is too much by one <SENTENCE-END> 
    thou counterfeit to thy true friend  
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  in love
    who respects friend
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  all men but proteus <SENTENCE-END> 
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
    can no way change you to a milder form
    ill woo you like a soldier at arms end
    and love you gainst the nature of love force ye <SENTENCE-END> 
  silvia <SENTENCE-END>  o heaven
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  ill force thee yield to my desire <SENTENCE-END> 
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
    thou friend of an ill fashion
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  valentine
  valentine <SENTENCE-END>  thou common friend thats without faith or love
    for such is a friend now treacherous man
    thou hast beguild my hopes nought but mine eye
    could have persuaded me <SENTENCE-END>  now i dare not say
    i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me <SENTENCE-END> 
    who should be trusted when ones own right hand
    is perjured to the bosom proteus
    i am sorry i must never trust thee more  
    but count the world a stranger for thy sake <SENTENCE-END> 
    the private wound is deepest <SENTENCE-END>  o time most accurst
    mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
  proteus <SENTENCE-END>  my shame and guilt confounds me <SENTENCE-END>

act i <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
sicilia <SENTENCE-END>  the palace of leontes

enter camillo and archidamus

  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on the
    like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see
    as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your
    sicilia <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to
    pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him <SENTENCE-END> 
  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
    justified in our loves for indeed
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  beseech you
  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we
    cannot with such magnificence in so rare i know not what to
    say <SENTENCE-END>  we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses
    unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot
    praise us as little accuse us <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  you pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely <SENTENCE-END> 
  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me
    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance <SENTENCE-END>   
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia <SENTENCE-END>  they were
    traind together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt
    them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now <SENTENCE-END> 
    since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
    separation of their society their encounters though not
    personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts
    letters loving embassies that they have seemd to be together
    though absent shook hands as over a vast and embracd as it
    were from the ends of opposed winds <SENTENCE-END>  the heavens continue their
    loves
  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  i think there is not in the world either malice or
    matter to alter it <SENTENCE-END>  you have an unspeakable comfort of your young
    prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that
    ever came into my note <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i very well agree with you in the hopes of him <SENTENCE-END>  it is a
    gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old
    hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
    yet their life to see him a man <SENTENCE-END> 
  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  would they else be content to die
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire  
    to live <SENTENCE-END> 
  archidamus <SENTENCE-END>  if the king had no son they would desire to live on
    crutches till he had one <SENTENCE-END>

    but of the finer natures by some severals
    of headpiece extraordinary lower messes
    perchance are to this business purblind say <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  business my lord i think most understand
    bohemia stays here longer <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  ha
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  stays here longer <SENTENCE-END>   
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  ay but why
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
    of our most gracious mistress <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  satisfy
    th entreaties of your mistress satisfy
    let that suffice <SENTENCE-END>  i have trusted thee camillo
    with all the nearest things to my heart as well
    my chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
    hast cleansd my bosom i from thee departed
    thy penitent reformd but we have been
    deceivd in thy integrity deceivd
    in that which seems so <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  be it forbid my lord
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  to bide upont thou art not honest or
    if thou inclinst that way thou art a coward
    which hoxes honesty behind restraining
    from course requird or else thou must be counted
    a servant grafted in my serious trust
    and therein negligent or else a fool
    that seest a game playd home the rich stake drawn  
    and takst it all for jest <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  my gracious lord
    i may be negligent foolish and fearful
    in every one of these no man is free
    but that his negligence his folly fear
    among the infinite doings of the world
    sometime puts forth <SENTENCE-END>  in your affairs my lord
    if ever i were wilfullnegligent
    it was my folly if industriously
    i playd the fool it was my negligence
    not weighing well the end if ever fearful
    to do a thing where i the issue doubted
    whereof the execution did cry out
    against the nonperformance twas a fear
    which oft infects the wisest <SENTENCE-END>  these my lord
    are such allowd infirmities that honesty
    is never free of <SENTENCE-END>  but beseech your grace
    be plainer with me let me know my trespass
    by its own visage if i then deny it
    tis none of mine <SENTENCE-END>   
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  ha not you seen camillo
    but thats past doubt you have or your eyeglass
    is thicker than a cuckolds horn or heard
    for to a vision so apparent rumour
    cannot be mute or thought for cogitation
    resides not in that man that does not think
    my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess
    or else be impudently negative
    to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
    my wifes a hobbyhorse deserves a name
    as rank as any flaxwench that puts to
    before her trothplight <SENTENCE-END>  sayt and justifyt <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i would not be a standerby to hear
    my sovereign mistress clouded so without
    my present vengeance taken <SENTENCE-END>  shrew my heart
    you never spoke what did become you less
    than this which to reiterate were sin
    as deep as that though true <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  is whispering nothing
    is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses  
    kissing with inside lip stopping the career
    of laughter with a sigh a note infallible
    of breaking honesty <SENTENCE-END>  horsing foot on foot
    skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
    hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
    blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
    that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
    why then the world and all thats int is nothing
    the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing
    my is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
    if this be nothing <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  good my lord be curd
    of this diseasd opinion and betimes
    for tis most dangerous <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  say it be tis true <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  no no my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  it is you lie you lie <SENTENCE-END> 
    i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee
    pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
    or else a hovering temporizer that  
    canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
    inclining to them both <SENTENCE-END>  were my wifes liver
    infected as her life she would not live
    the running of one glass <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  who does her
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  why he that wears her like her medal hanging
    about his neck bohemia who if i
    had servants true about me that bare eyes
    to see alike mine honour as their profits
    their own particular thrifts they would do that
    which should undo more doing <SENTENCE-END>  ay and thou
    his cupbearer whom i from meaner form
    have benchd and reard to worship who mayst see
    plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
    how i am galld mightst bespice a cup
    to give mine enemy a lasting wink
    which draught to me were cordial <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  sir my lord
    i could do this and that with no rash potion
    but with a lingring dram that should not work  
    maliciously like poison <SENTENCE-END>  but i cannot
    believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
    so sovereignly being honourable <SENTENCE-END> 
    i have lovd thee
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  make that thy question and go rot
    dost think i am so muddy so unsettled
    to appoint myself in this vexation sully
    the purity and whiteness of my sheets
    which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
    is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
    give scandal to the blood o th prince my son
    who i do think is mine and love as mine
    without ripe moving to t would i do this
    could man so blench
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i must believe you sir <SENTENCE-END> 
    i do and will fetch off bohemia fort
    provided that when hes removd your highness
    will take again your queen as yours at first
    even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing
    the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms  
    known and allied to yours <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  thou dost advise me
    even so as i mine own course have set down <SENTENCE-END> 
    ill give no blemish to her honour none <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  my lord

    as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia
    and with your queen <SENTENCE-END>  i am his cupbearer
    if from me he have wholesome beverage
    account me not your servant <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  this is all
    dot and thou hast the one half of my heart
    dot not thou splitst thine own <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  ill dot my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  i will seem friendly as thou hast advisd me <SENTENCE-END>    exit
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  o miserable lady but for me
    what case stand i in i must be the poisoner
    of good polixenes and my ground to dot
    is the obedience to a master one
    who in rebellion with himself will have  
    all that are his so too <SENTENCE-END>  to do this deed
    promotion follows <SENTENCE-END>  if i could find example
    of thousands that had struck anointed kings
    and flourishd after id not dot but since
    nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
    let villainy itself forsweart <SENTENCE-END>  i must
    forsake the court <SENTENCE-END>  to dot or no is certain
    to me a breakneck <SENTENCE-END>  happy star reign now
    here comes bohemia <SENTENCE-END> 

                     enter polixenes

  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  this is strange <SENTENCE-END>  methinks
    my favour here begins to warp <SENTENCE-END>  not speak
    good day camillo <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  hail most royal sir
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  what is the news i th court
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  none rare my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  the king hath on him such a countenance
    as he had lost some province and a region  
    lovd as he loves himself even now i met him
    with customary compliment when he
    wafting his eyes to th contrary and falling
    a lip of much contempt speeds from me
    so leaves me to consider what is breeding
    that changes thus his manners <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i dare not know my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  how dare not do not <SENTENCE-END>  do you know and dare not
    be intelligent to me tis thereabouts
    for to yourself what you do know you must
    and cannot say you dare not <SENTENCE-END>  good camillo
    your changd complexions are to me a mirror
    which shows me mine changd too for i must be
    a party in this alteration finding
    myself thus alterd witht <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  there is a sickness
    which puts some of us in distemper but
    i cannot name the disease and it is caught
    of you that yet are well <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  how caught of me  
    make me not sighted like the basilisk
    i have lookd on thousands who have sped the better
    by my regard but killd none so <SENTENCE-END>  camillo
    as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
    clerklike experiencd which no less adorns
    our gentry than our parents noble names
    in whose success we are gentle i beseech you
    if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
    thereof to be informd imprisont not
    in ignorant concealment <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i may not answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  a sickness caught of me and yet i well
    i must be answerd <SENTENCE-END>  dost thou hear camillo
    i conjure thee by all the parts of man
    which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
    is not this suit of mine that thou declare
    what incidency thou dost guess of harm
    is creeping toward me how far off how near
    which way to be prevented if to be
    if not how best to bear it <SENTENCE-END>   
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  sir i will tell you
    since i am chargd in honour and by him
    that i think honourable <SENTENCE-END>  therefore mark my counsel
    which must be evn as swiftly followed as
    i mean to utter it or both yourself and me
    cry lost and so goodnight <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  on good camillo <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i am appointed him to murder you <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  by whom camillo
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  by the king <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  for what
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  he thinks nay with all confidence he swears
    as he had seen t or been an instrument
    to vice you tot that you have touchd his queen
    forbiddenly <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  o then my best blood turn
    to an infected jelly and my name
    be yokd with his that did betray the best
    turn then my freshest reputation to
    a savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
    where i arrive and my approach be shunnd
    nay hated too worse than the greatst infection
    that eer was heard or read
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  swear his thought over
    by each particular star in heaven and
    by all their influences you may as well
    forbid the sea for to obey the moon
    as or by oath remove or counsel shake
    the fabric of his folly whose foundation
    is pild upon his faith and will continue
    the standing of his body <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  how should this grow
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i know not but i am sure tis safer to
    avoid whats grown than question how tis born <SENTENCE-END> 
    if therefore you dare trust my honesty
    that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
    shall bear along impawnd away tonight <SENTENCE-END> 
    your followers i will whisper to the business
    and will by twos and threes at several posterns
    clear them o th city <SENTENCE-END>  for myself ill put  
    my fortunes to your service which are here
    by this discovery lost <SENTENCE-END>  be not uncertain
    for by the honour of my parents i
    have uttred truth which if you seek to prove
    i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
    than one condemnd by the kings own mouth thereon
    his execution sworn <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  i do believe thee
    i saw his heart ins face <SENTENCE-END>  give me thy hand
    be pilot to me and thy places shall
    still neighbour mine <SENTENCE-END>  my ships are ready and
    my people did expect my hence departure
    two days ago <SENTENCE-END>  this jealousy
    is for a precious creature as shes rare
    must it be great and as his persons mighty
    must it be violent and as he does conceive
    he is dishonourd by a man which ever
    professd to him why his revenges must
    in that be made more bitter <SENTENCE-END>  fear oershades me <SENTENCE-END> 
    good expedition be my friend and comfort  
    the gracious queen part of this theme but nothing
    of his illtaen suspicion come camillo
    i will respect thee as a father if
    thou bearst my life off hence <SENTENCE-END>  let us avoid <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  it is in mine authority to command
    the keys of all the posterns <SENTENCE-END>  please your highness
    to take the urgent hour <SENTENCE-END>  come sir away <SENTENCE-END>              exeunt

    even to their ships <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  how blest am i
    in my just censure in my true opinion
    alack for lesser knowledge how accursd
    in being so blest there may be in the cup
    a spider steepd and one may drink depart
    and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
    is not infected but if one present  
    th abhorrd ingredient to his eye make known
    how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
    with violent hefts <SENTENCE-END>  i have drunk and seen the spider <SENTENCE-END> 
    camillo was his help in this his pander <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is a plot against my life my crown
    alls true that is mistrusted <SENTENCE-END>  that false villain
    whom i employd was preemployd by him
    he has discoverd my design and i
    remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick
    for them to play at will <SENTENCE-END>  how came the posterns
    so easily open
  first lord <SENTENCE-END>  by his great authority
    which often hath no less prevaild than so
    on your command <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  i knowt too well <SENTENCE-END> 
    give me the boy <SENTENCE-END>  i am glad you did not nurse him
    though he does bear some signs of me yet you
    have too much blood in him <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  what is this sport
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  bear the boy hence he shall not come about her  
    away with him and let her sport herself

    with that shes big with for tis polixenes
    has made thee swell thus <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  but id say he had not
    and ill be sworn you would believe my saying
    howeer you lean to th nayward <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  you my lords
    look on her mark her well be but about
    to say she is a goodly lady and
    the justice of your hearts will thereto ad
    tis pity shes not honest honourable <SENTENCE-END> 
    praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
    which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
    the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
    that calumny doth use o i am out
    that mercy does for calumny will sear
    virtue itself these shrugs these hums and has
    when you have said shes goodly come between
    ere you can say shes honest <SENTENCE-END>  but bet known  
    from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
    shes an adultress <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  should a villain say so
    the most replenishd villain in the world
    he were as much more villain you my lord
    do but mistake <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  you have mistook my lady
    polixenes for leontes <SENTENCE-END>  o thou thing
    which ill not call a creature of thy place
    lest barbarism making me the precedent
    should a like language use to all degrees
    and mannerly distinguishment leave out
    betwixt the prince and beggar <SENTENCE-END>  i have said
    shes an adultress i have said with whom <SENTENCE-END> 
    more shes a traitor and camillo is
    a federary with her and one that knows
    what she should shame to know herself
    but with her most vile principal that shes
    a bedswerver even as bad as those
    that vulgars give boldst titles ay and privy  
    to this their late escape <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  no by my life
    privy to none of this <SENTENCE-END>  how will this grieve you
    when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
    you thus have publishd me gentle my lord
    you scarce can right me throughly then to say
    you did mistake <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  no if i mistake
    in those foundations which i build upon
    the centre is not big enough to bear
    a schoolboys top <SENTENCE-END>  away with her to prison <SENTENCE-END> 
    he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
    but that he speaks <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  theres some ill planet reigns <SENTENCE-END> 
    i must be patient till the heavens look
    with an aspect more favourable <SENTENCE-END>  good my lords
    i am not prone to weeping as our sex

  antigonus <SENTENCE-END>  and i wish my liege
    you had only in your silent judgment tried it
    without more overture <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  how could that be
    either thou art most ignorant by age
    or thou wert born a fool <SENTENCE-END>  camillos flight
    added to their familiarity
    which was as gross as ever touchd conjecture
    that lackd sight only nought for approbation
    but only seeing all other circumstances
    made up to th deed doth push on this proceeding <SENTENCE-END>   
    yet for a greater confirmation
    for in an act of this importance twere
    most piteous to be wild i have dispatchd in post
    to sacred delphos to apollos temple
    cleomenes and dion whom you know
    of stuffd sufficiency <SENTENCE-END>  now from the oracle
    they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
    shall stop or spur me <SENTENCE-END>  have i done well
  first lord <SENTENCE-END>  well done my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  though i am satisfied and need no more
    than what i know yet shall the oracle
    give rest to th minds of others such as he
    whose ignorant credulity will not
    come up to th truth <SENTENCE-END>  so have we thought it good
    from our free person she should be confind
    lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
    be left her to perform <SENTENCE-END>  come follow us
    we are to speak in public for this business
    will raise us all <SENTENCE-END> 
  antigonus <SENTENCE-END>   aside  to laughter as i take it  
    if the good truth were known <SENTENCE-END>

  dion <SENTENCE-END>  i shall report
    for most it caught me the celestial habits

    of the grave wearers <SENTENCE-END>  o the sacrifice
    how ceremonious solemn and unearthly
    it was i th offring

    so forcing faults upon hermione
    i little like <SENTENCE-END> 
  dion <SENTENCE-END>  the violent carriage of it
    will clear or end the business <SENTENCE-END>  when the oracle
    thus by apollos great divine seald up
    shall the contents discover something rare
    even then will rush to knowledge <SENTENCE-END>  go fresh horses <SENTENCE-END>

enter leontes lords and officers

  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  this sessions to our great grief we pronounce
    even pushes gainst our heart the party tried
    the daughter of a king our wife and one
    of us too much belovd <SENTENCE-END>  let us be cleard
    of being tyrannous since we so openly
    proceed in justice which shall have due course
    even to the guilt or the purgation <SENTENCE-END> 
    produce the prisoner <SENTENCE-END> 
  officer <SENTENCE-END>  it is his highness pleasure that the queen
    appear in person here in court <SENTENCE-END> 

         enter hermione as to her trial paulina and ladies

    silence
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  read the indictment <SENTENCE-END> 
  officer <SENTENCE-END>   reads  hermione queen to the worthy leontes king of
    sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in  
    committing adultery with polixenes king of bohemia and
    conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
    lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by
    circumstances partly laid open thou hermione contrary to the
    faith and allegiance of true subject didst counsel and aid them
    for their better safety to fly away by night <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  since what i am to say must be but that
    which contradicts my accusation and
    the testimony on my part no other
    but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
    to say not guilty <SENTENCE-END>  mine integrity
    being counted falsehood shall as i express it
    be so receivd <SENTENCE-END>  but thus if powrs divine
    behold our human actions as they do
    i doubt not then but innocence shall make
    false accusation blush and tyranny
    tremble at patience <SENTENCE-END>  you my lord best know
    who least will seem to do so my past life
    hath been as continent as chaste as true
    as i am now unhappy which is more  
    than history can pattern though devisd
    and playd to take spectators for behold me
    a fellow of the royal bed which owe
    a moiety of the throne a great kings daughter
    the mother to a hopeful prince here standing
    to prate and talk for life and honour fore
    who please to come and hear <SENTENCE-END>  for life i prize it
    as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour
    tis a derivative from me to mine
    and only that i stand for <SENTENCE-END>  i appeal
    to your own conscience sir before polixenes
    came to your court how i was in your grace
    how merited to be so since he came
    with what encounter so uncurrent i
    have straind t appear thus if one jot beyond
    the bound of honour or in act or will
    that way inclining hardned be the hearts
    of all that hear me and my nearst of kin
    cry fie upon my grave
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  i neer heard yet  
    that any of these bolder vices wanted
    less impudence to gainsay what they did
    than to perform it first <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  thats true enough
    though tis a saying sir not due to me <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  you will not own it <SENTENCE-END> 
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  more than mistress of
    which comes to me in name of fault i must not
    at all acknowledge <SENTENCE-END>  for polixenes
    with whom i am accusd i do confess
    i lovd him as in honour he requird
    with such a kind of love as might become
    a lady like me with a love even such
    so and no other as yourself commanded
    which not to have done i think had been in me
    both disobedience and ingratitude
    to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
    ever since it could speak from an infant freely
    that it was yours <SENTENCE-END>  now for conspiracy
    i know not how it tastes though it be dishd  
    for me to try how all i know of it
    is that camillo was an honest man
    and why he left your court the gods themselves
    wotting no more than i are ignorant <SENTENCE-END>

    and i but dreamd it <SENTENCE-END>  as you were past all shame
    those of your fact are so so past all truth
    which to deny concerns more than avails for as
    thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
    no father owning it which is indeed
    more criminal in thee than it so thou
    shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
    look for no less than death <SENTENCE-END>   
  hermione <SENTENCE-END>  sir spare your threats <SENTENCE-END> 
    the bug which you would fright me with i seek <SENTENCE-END> 
    to me can life be no commodity <SENTENCE-END>

    and first fruits of my body from his presence
    i am barrd like one infectious my third comfort
    starrd most unluckily is from my breast
    the innocent milk in it most innocent mouth
    hald out to murder myself on every post

enter time the chorus

  time <SENTENCE-END>  i that please some try all both joy and terror
    of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
    now take upon me in the name of time
    to use my wings <SENTENCE-END>  impute it not a crime
    to me or my swift passage that i slide
    oer sixteen years and leave the growth untried
    of that wide gap since it is in my powr
    to oerthrow law and in one selfborn hour
    to plant and oerwhelm custom <SENTENCE-END>  let me pass
    the same i am ere ancientst order was
    or what is now receivd <SENTENCE-END>  i witness to
    the times that brought them in so shall i do
    to th freshest things now reigning and make stale
    the glistering of this present as my tale
    now seems to it <SENTENCE-END>  your patience this allowing
    i turn my glass and give my scene such growing
    as you had slept between <SENTENCE-END>  leontes leaving
    th effects of his fond jealousies so grieving  
    that he shuts up himself imagine me
    gentle spectators that i now may be
    in fair bohemia and remember well
    i mentiond a son o th kings which florizel
    i now name to you and with speed so pace
    to speak of perdita now grown in grace
    equal with wondring <SENTENCE-END>  what of her ensues
    i list not prophesy but let times news
    be known when tis brought forth <SENTENCE-END>  a shepherds daughter
    and what to her adheres which follows after
    is th argument of time <SENTENCE-END>  of this allow
    if ever you have spent time worse ere now
    if never yet that time himself doth say
    he wishes earnestly you never may <SENTENCE-END>                       exit




scene ii <SENTENCE-END> 
bohemia <SENTENCE-END>  the palace of polixenes

enter polixenes and camillo

  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate tis
    a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  it is fifteen years since i saw my country though i have
    for the most part been aired abroad i desire to lay my bones
    there <SENTENCE-END>  besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me
    to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay or i oerween to
    think so which is another spur to my departure <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  as thou lovst me camillo wipe not out the rest of thy
    services by leaving me now <SENTENCE-END>  the need i have of thee thine own
    goodness hath made <SENTENCE-END>  better not to have had thee than thus to want
    thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can
    sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or
    take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if i
    have not enough considered as too much i cannot to be more
    thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the
    heaping friendships <SENTENCE-END>  of that fatal country sicilia prithee
    speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance  
    of that penitent as thou callst him and reconciled king my
    brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are
    even now to be afresh lamented <SENTENCE-END>  say to me when sawst thou the
    prince florizel my son kings are no less unhappy their issue
    not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have
    approved their virtues <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  sir it is three days since i saw the prince <SENTENCE-END>  what his
    happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i have missingly
    noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent
    to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  i have considered so much camillo and with some care
    so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his
    removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is
    seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say
    that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
    neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of
    most rare note <SENTENCE-END>  the report of her is extended more than can be
    thought to begin from such a cottage <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  thats likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the  
    angle that plucks our son thither <SENTENCE-END>  thou shalt accompany us to the
    place where we will not appearing what we are have some
    question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not
    uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither <SENTENCE-END>  prithee be my
    present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of
    sicilia <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i willingly obey your command <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  my best camillo we must disguise ourselves <SENTENCE-END>

      when daffodils begin to peer
        with heigh the doxy over the dale
      why then comes in the sweet o the year
        for the red blood reigns in the winters pale <SENTENCE-END> 

      the white sheet bleaching on the hedge
        with heigh the sweet birds o how they sing
      doth set my pugging tooth on edge
        for a quart of ale is a dish for a king <SENTENCE-END> 

      the lark that tirralirra chants
        with heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay
      are summer songs for me and my aunts
        while we lie tumbling in the hay <SENTENCE-END> 

    i have servd prince florizel and in my time wore threepile
    but now i am out of service <SENTENCE-END>   

      but shall i go mourn for that my dear

    interpretation should abuse and call this
    your lack of love or bounty you were straited  
    for a reply at least if you make a care
    of happy holding her <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  old sir i know
    she prizes not such trifles as these are <SENTENCE-END>

    worthy enough a herdsman yea him too
    that makes himself but for our honour therein
    unworthy thee if ever henceforth thou
    these rural latches to his entrance open
    or hoop his body more with thy embraces
    i will devise a death as cruel for thee
    as thou art tender tot <SENTENCE-END>                                 exit
  perdita <SENTENCE-END>  even here undone
    i was not much afeard for once or twice

    looks on alike <SENTENCE-END>   to florizel  willt please you sir be gone
    i told you what would come of this <SENTENCE-END>  beseech you
    of your own state take care <SENTENCE-END>  this dream of mine

    nor dare to know that which i know <SENTENCE-END>   to florizel  o sir
    you have undone a man of fourscorethree
    that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
    to die upon the bed my father died
    to lie close by his honest bones but now
    some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
    where no priest shovels in dust <SENTENCE-END>  to perdita o cursed wretch
    that knewst this was the prince and wouldst adventure
    to mingle faith with him undone undone
    if i might die within this hour i have livd

  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  why look you so upon me
    i am but sorry not afeard delayd
    but nothing altred <SENTENCE-END>  what i was i am
    more straining on for plucking back not following
    my leash unwillingly <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  gracious my lord
    you know your fathers temper <SENTENCE-END>  at this time  
    he will allow no speech which i do guess
    you do not purpose to him and as hardly
    will he endure your sight as yet i fear
    then till the fury of his highness settle
    come not before him <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  i not purpose it <SENTENCE-END> 
    i think camillo
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  even he my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
  perdita <SENTENCE-END>  how often have i told you twould be thus
    how often said my dignity would last
    but till twere known
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  it cannot fail but by
    the violation of my faith and then
    let nature crush the sides o th earth together
    and mar the seeds within lift up thy looks <SENTENCE-END> 
    from my succession wipe me father i
    am heir to my affection <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  be advisd <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  i am and by my fancy if my reason
    will thereto be obedient i have reason  
    if not my senses better pleasd with madness
    do bid it welcome <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  this is desperate sir <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  so call it but it does fulfil my vow
    i needs must think it honesty <SENTENCE-END>  camillo
    not for bohemia nor the pomp that may
    be thereat gleand for all the sun sees or
    the close earth wombs or the profound seas hides
    in unknown fathoms will i break my oath
    to this my fair belovd <SENTENCE-END>  therefore i pray you
    as you have ever been my fathers honourd friend
    when he shall miss me as in faith i mean not
    to see him any more cast your good counsels
    upon his passion <SENTENCE-END>  let myself and fortune
    tug for the time to come <SENTENCE-END>  this you may know
    and so deliver i am put to sea
    with her who here i cannot hold on shore <SENTENCE-END> 
    and most opportune to her need i have
    a vessel rides fast by but not prepard
    for this design <SENTENCE-END>  what course i mean to hold  
    shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
    concern me the reporting <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  o my lord
    i would your spirit were easier for advice <SENTENCE-END> 
    or stronger for your need <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  hark perdita <SENTENCE-END>                      takes her aside
    to camillo  ill hear you by and by <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  hes irremovable
    resolvd for flight <SENTENCE-END>  now were i happy if
    his going i could frame to serve my turn
    save him from danger do him love and honour
    purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
    and that unhappy king my master whom
    i so much thirst to see <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  now good camillo
    i am so fraught with curious business that
    i leave out ceremony <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  sir i think
    you have heard of my poor services i th love
    that i have borne your father  
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  very nobly
    have you deservd <SENTENCE-END>  it is my fathers music
    to speak your deeds not little of his care
    to have them recompensd as thought on <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  well my lord
    if you may please to think i love the king
    and through him whats nearest to him which is
    your gracious self embrace but my direction <SENTENCE-END> 
    if your more ponderous and settled project
    may suffer alteration on mine honour
    ill point you where you shall have such receiving
    as shall become your highness where you may
    enjoy your mistress from the whom i see
    theres no disjunction to be made but by
    as heavens forfend your ruin marry her
    and with my best endeavours in your absence
    your discontenting father strive to qualify
    and bring him up to liking <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  how camillo
    may this almost a miracle be done  
    that i may call thee something more than man
    and after that trust to thee <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  have you thought on
    a place whereto youll go
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  not any yet
    but as th unthoughton accident is guilty
    to what we wildly do so we profess
    ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
    of every wind that blows <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  then list to me <SENTENCE-END> 
    this follows if you will not change your purpose
    but undergo this flight make for sicilia
    and there present yourself and your fair princess
    for so i see she must be fore leontes <SENTENCE-END> 
    she shall be habited as it becomes
    the partner of your bed <SENTENCE-END>  methinks i see
    leontes opening his free arms and weeping
    his welcomes forth asks thee there son forgiveness
    as twere i th fathers person kisses the hands
    of your fresh princess oer and oer divides him  
    twixt his unkindness and his kindness th one
    he chides to hell and bids the other grow
    faster than thought or time <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  worthy camillo
    what colour for my visitation shall i
    hold up before him
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  sent by the king your father
    to greet him and to give him comforts <SENTENCE-END>  sir
    the manner of your bearing towards him with
    what you as from your father shall deliver
    things known betwixt us three ill write you down
    the which shall point you forth at every sitting
    what you must say that he shall not perceive
    but that you have your fathers bosom there
    and speak his very heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  i am bound to you <SENTENCE-END> 
    there is some sap in this <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  a course more promising
    than a wild dedication of yourselves
    to unpathd waters undreamd shores most certain  
    to miseries enough no hope to help you
    but as you shake off one to take another
    nothing so certain as your anchors who
    do their best office if they can but stay you
    where youll be loath to be <SENTENCE-END>  besides you know
    prosperitys the very bond of love
    whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
    affliction alters <SENTENCE-END> 
  perdita <SENTENCE-END>  one of these is true
    i think affliction may subdue the cheek
    but not take in the mind <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  yea say you so
    there shall not at your fathers house these seven years
    be born another such <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  my good camillo
    she is as forward of her breeding as
    she is i th rear o our birth <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  i cannot say tis pity
    she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
    to most that teach <SENTENCE-END>   
  perdita <SENTENCE-END>  your pardon sir for this
    ill blush you thanks <SENTENCE-END> 
  florizel <SENTENCE-END>  my prettiest perdita
    but o the thorns we stand upon camillo
    preserver of my father now of me
    the medicine of our house how shall we do
    we are not furnishd like bohemias son
    nor shall appear in sicilia <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  my lord
    fear none of this <SENTENCE-END>  i think you know my fortunes
    do all lie there <SENTENCE-END>  it shall be so my care
    to have you royally appointed as if
    the scene you play were mine <SENTENCE-END>  for instance sir
    that you may know you shall not want one word <SENTENCE-END> 
                                               they talk aside

    hornring to keep my pack from fasting <SENTENCE-END>  they throng who should
    buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a
    benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was
    best in picture and what i saw to my good use i remembred <SENTENCE-END>  my
    clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in
    love with the wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
    till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the
    herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears <SENTENCE-END>  you might
    have pinchd a placket it was senseless twas nothing to geld a
    codpiece of a purse i would have fild keys off that hung in
    chains <SENTENCE-END>  no hearing no feeling but my sirs song and admiring
    the nothing of it <SENTENCE-END>  so that in this time of lethargy i pickd and
    cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come
    in with whoobub against his daughter and the kings son and
    scard my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in
    the whole army <SENTENCE-END>

    ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a
    cutpurse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for
    th other senses <SENTENCE-END>  i see this is the time that the unjust man doth
    thrive <SENTENCE-END>  what an exchange had this been without boot what a boot
    is here with this exchange sure the gods do this year connive

act v <SENTENCE-END>  scene i <SENTENCE-END> 
sicilia <SENTENCE-END>  the palace of leontes

enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and others

  cleomenes <SENTENCE-END>  sir you have done enough and have performd
    a saintlike sorrow <SENTENCE-END>  no fault could you make
    which you have not redeemd indeed paid down
    more penitence than done trespass <SENTENCE-END>  at the last
    do as the heavens have done forget your evil
    with them forgive yourself <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  whilst i remember
    her and her virtues i cannot forget
    my blemishes in them and so still think of
    the wrong i did myself which was so much
    that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
    destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man
    bred his hopes out of <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  true too true my lord <SENTENCE-END> 
    if one by one you wedded all the world
    or from the all that are took something good
    to make a perfect woman she you killd  
    would be unparalleld <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  i think so <SENTENCE-END>  killd
    she i killd i did so but thou strikst me
    sorely to say i did <SENTENCE-END>  it is as bitter
    upon thy tongue as in my thought <SENTENCE-END>  now good now
    say so but seldom <SENTENCE-END> 
  cleomenes <SENTENCE-END>  not at all good lady <SENTENCE-END> 
    you might have spoken a thousand things that would
    have done the time more benefit and gracd
    your kindness better <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  you are one of those
    would have him wed again <SENTENCE-END> 
  dion <SENTENCE-END>  if you would not so
    you pity not the state nor the remembrance
    of his most sovereign name consider little
    what dangers by his highness fail of issue
    may drop upon his kingdom and devour
    incertain lookerson <SENTENCE-END>  what were more holy
    than to rejoice the former queen is well
    what holier than for royaltys repair  
    for present comfort and for future good
    to bless the bed of majesty again
    with a sweet fellow tot
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  there is none worthy
    respecting her thats gone <SENTENCE-END>  besides the gods
    will have fulfilld their secret purposes
    for has not the divine apollo said
    ist not the tenour of his oracle
    that king leontes shall not have an heir
    till his lost child be found which that it shall
    is all as monstrous to our human reason
    as my antigonus to break his grave
    and come again to me who on my life
    did perish with the infant <SENTENCE-END>  tis your counsel
    my lord should to the heavens be contrary
    oppose against their wills <SENTENCE-END>   to leontes  care not for issue
    the crown will find an heir <SENTENCE-END>  great alexander
    left his to th worthiest so his successor
    was like to be the best <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  good paulina  
    who hast the memory of hermione
    i know in honour o that ever i
    had squard me to thy counsel then even now
    i might have lookd upon my queens full eyes
    have taken treasure from her lips
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  and left them
    more rich for what they yielded <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  thou speakst truth <SENTENCE-END> 
    no more such wives therefore no wife <SENTENCE-END>  one worse
    and better usd would make her sainted spirit
    again possess her corpse and on this stage
    where we offend her now appear soulvexd
    and begin why to me
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  had she such power
    she had just cause <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  she had and would incense me
    to murder her i married <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  i should so <SENTENCE-END> 
    were i the ghost that walkd id bid you mark
    her eye and tell me for what dull part int  
    you chose her then id shriek that even your ears
    should rift to hear me and the words that followd
    should be remember mine <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  stars stars
    and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife
    ill have no wife paulina <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  will you swear
    never to marry but by my free leave
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  never paulina so be blest my spirit
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  then good my lords bear witness to his oath <SENTENCE-END> 
  cleomenes <SENTENCE-END>  you tempt him overmuch <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  unless another
    as like hermione as is her picture
    affront his eye <SENTENCE-END> 
  cleomenes <SENTENCE-END>  good madam
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  i have done <SENTENCE-END> 
    yet if my lord will marry if you will sir
    no remedy but you will give me the office
    to choose you a queen <SENTENCE-END>  she shall not be so young
    as was your former but she shall be such  
    as walkd your first queens ghost it should take joy
    to see her in your arms <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  my true paulina
    we shall not marry till thou bidst us <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  that
    shall be when your first queens again in breath
    never till then <SENTENCE-END> 

                       enter a gentleman

  gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  one that gives out himself prince florizel
    son of polixenes with his princess she
    the fairest i have yet beheld desires access
    to your high presence <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  what with him he comes not
    like to his fathers greatness <SENTENCE-END>  his approach
    so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
    tis not a visitation framd but forcd
    by need and accident <SENTENCE-END>  what train

    and those but mean <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  his princess say you with him
  gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  ay the most peerless piece of earth i think
    that eer the sun shone bright on <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  o hermione
    as every present time doth boast itself
    above a better gone so must thy grave
    give way to whats seen now sir you yourself
    have said and writ so but your writing now
    is colder than that theme she had not been
    nor was not to be equalld <SENTENCE-END>  thus your verse
    flowd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebbd
    to say you have seen a better <SENTENCE-END> 
  gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  pardon madam <SENTENCE-END> 
    the one i have almost forgot your pardon
    the other when she has obtaind your eye
    will have your tongue too <SENTENCE-END>  this is a creature
    would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
    of all professors else make proselytes
    of who she but bid follow <SENTENCE-END>   
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  how not women
  gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  women will love her that she is a woman
    more worth than any man men that she is
    the rarest of all women <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  go cleomenes

  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  had our prince
    jewel of children seen this hour he had paird
    well with this lord there was not full a month
    between their births <SENTENCE-END>

    he dies to me again when talkd of <SENTENCE-END>  sure

    exposd this paragon to th fearful usage
    at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune

  first gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  i make a broken delivery of the business but the
    changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of
    admiration <SENTENCE-END>  they seemd almost with staring on one another to
    tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness
    language in their very gesture they lookd as they had heard of
    a world ransomd or one destroyed <SENTENCE-END>  a notable passion of wonder
    appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but
    seeing could not say if th importance were joy or sorrow but in
    the extremity of the one it must needs be <SENTENCE-END> 

                    enter another gentleman  

    here comes a gentleman that happily knows more <SENTENCE-END>  the news rogero
  second gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  nothing but bonfires <SENTENCE-END>  the oracle is fulfilld
    the kings daughter is found <SENTENCE-END>  such a deal of wonder is broken out
    within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it <SENTENCE-END> 

                    enter another gentleman

    here comes the lady paulinas steward he can deliver you more <SENTENCE-END> 
    how goes it now sir this news which is calld true is so like
    an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion <SENTENCE-END>  has the
    king found his heir
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  most true if ever truth were pregnant by
    circumstance <SENTENCE-END>  that which you hear youll swear you see there is
    such unity in the proofs <SENTENCE-END>  the mantle of queen hermiones her
    jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with
    it which they know to be his character the majesty of the
    creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness
    which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences
    proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter <SENTENCE-END>  did  
    you see the meeting of the two kings
  second gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END> 
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  then you have lost a sight which was to be seen
    cannot be spoken of <SENTENCE-END>  there might you have beheld one joy crown
    another so and in such manner that it seemd sorrow wept to take
    leave of them for their joy waded in tears <SENTENCE-END>  there was casting up
    of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such
    distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour <SENTENCE-END> 
    our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found
    daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries o thy
    mother thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces
    his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping
    her <SENTENCE-END>  now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a
    weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns <SENTENCE-END>  i never heard of
    such another encounter which lames report to follow it and
    undoes description to do it <SENTENCE-END> 
  second gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  what pray you became of antigonus that carried
    hence the child
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  like an old tale still which will have matter to
    rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was  
    torn to pieces with a bear <SENTENCE-END>  this avouches the shepherds son who
    has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but
    a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows <SENTENCE-END> 
  first gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  what became of his bark and his followers
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  wreckd the same instant of their masters death
    and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments
    which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was
    found <SENTENCE-END>  but o the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was
    fought in paulina she had one eye declind for the loss of her
    husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilld <SENTENCE-END>  she
    lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing
    as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be
    in danger of losing <SENTENCE-END> 
  first gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
    kings and princes for by such was it acted <SENTENCE-END> 
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  one of the prettiest touches of all and that
    which angld for mine eyes caught the water though not the
    fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the
    manner how she came tot bravely confessd and lamented by the
    king how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign  
    of dolour to another she did with an alas i would fain say
    bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood <SENTENCE-END>  who was most
    marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed <SENTENCE-END>  if all
    the world could have seent the woe had been universal <SENTENCE-END> 
  first gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  are they returned to the court
  third gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  no <SENTENCE-END>  the princess hearing of her mothers statue
    which is in the keeping of paulina a piece many years in doing
    and now newly performd by that rare italian master julio
    romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into
    his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is
    her ape <SENTENCE-END>  he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say
    one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with
    all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend
    to sup <SENTENCE-END> 
  second gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  i thought she had some great matter there in
    hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since
    the death of hermione visited that removed house <SENTENCE-END>  shall we
    thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
  first gentleman <SENTENCE-END>  who would be thence that has the benefit of
    access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born <SENTENCE-END>  our  
    absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge <SENTENCE-END>  lets along <SENTENCE-END>

lords and attendants

  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  o grave and good paulina the great comfort
    that i have had of thee
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  what sovereign sir
    i did not well i meant well <SENTENCE-END>  all my services
    you have paid home but that you have vouchsafd
    with your crownd brother and these your contracted
    heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
    it is a surplus of your grace which never
    my life may last to answer <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  o paulina
    we honour you with trouble but we came
    to see the statue of our queen <SENTENCE-END>  your gallery
    have we passd through not without much content
    in many singularities but we saw not
    that which my daughter came to look upon
    the statue of her mother <SENTENCE-END>   
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  as she livd peerless
    so her dead likeness i do well believe
    excels whatever yet you lookd upon
    or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it
    lonely apart <SENTENCE-END>  but here it is <SENTENCE-END>  prepare
    to see the life as lively mockd as ever
    still sleep mockd death <SENTENCE-END>  behold and say tis well <SENTENCE-END> 
                paulina draws a curtain and discovers hermione
                                         standing like a statue
    i like your silence it the more shows off
    your wonder but yet speak <SENTENCE-END>  first you my liege <SENTENCE-END> 
    comes it not something near
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  her natural posture
    chide me dear stone that i may say indeed
    thou art hermione or rather thou art she
    in thy not chiding for she was as tender
    as infancy and grace <SENTENCE-END>  but yet paulina
    hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
    so aged as this seems <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  o not by much  
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  so much the more our carvers excellence
    which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
    as she livd now <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  as now she might have done
    so much to my good comfort as it is
    now piercing to my soul <SENTENCE-END>  o thus she stood
    even with such life of majesty warm life
    as now it coldly stands when first i wood her
    i am ashamd <SENTENCE-END>  does not the stone rebuke me
    for being more stone than it o royal piece
    theres magic in thy majesty which has
    my evils conjurd to remembrance and
    from thy admiring daughter took the spirits
    standing like stone with thee
  perdita <SENTENCE-END>  and give me leave
    and do not say tis superstition that
    i kneel and then implore her blessing <SENTENCE-END>  lady
    dear queen that ended when i but began
    give me that hand of yours to kiss <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  o patience  
    the statue is but newly fixd the colours
    not dry <SENTENCE-END> 
  camillo <SENTENCE-END>  my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
    which sixteen winters cannot blow away
    so many summers dry <SENTENCE-END>  scarce any joy
    did ever so long live no sorrow
    but killd itself much sooner <SENTENCE-END> 
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  dear my brother
    let him that was the cause of this have powr
    to take off so much grief from you as he
    will piece up in himself <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  indeed my lord
    if i had thought the sight of my poor image
    would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine
    id not have showd it <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  do not draw the curtain <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  no longer shall you gaze ont lest your fancy
    may think anon it moves <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  let be let be <SENTENCE-END> 
    would i were dead but that methinks already  
    what was he that did make it see my lord
    would you not deem it breathd and that those veins
    did verily bear blood
  polixenes <SENTENCE-END>  masterly done
    the very life seems warm upon her lip <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  the fixture of her eye has motion int
    as we are mockd with art <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  ill draw the curtain <SENTENCE-END> 
    my lords almost so far transported that
    hell think anon it lives <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  o sweet paulina
    make me to think so twenty years together
    no settled senses of the world can match
    the pleasure of that madness <SENTENCE-END>  let t alone <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  i am sorry sir i have thus far stirrd you but
    i could afflict you farther <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  do paulina
    for this affliction has a taste as sweet
    as any cordial comfort <SENTENCE-END>  still methinks
    there is an air comes from her <SENTENCE-END>  what fine chisel  
    could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me
    for i will kiss her <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  good my lord forbear <SENTENCE-END> 
    the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
    youll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
    with oily painting <SENTENCE-END>  shall i draw the curtain
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  no not these twenty years <SENTENCE-END> 
  perdita <SENTENCE-END>  so long could i
    stand by a lookeron <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  either forbear
    quit presently the chapel or resolve you
    for more amazement <SENTENCE-END>  if you can behold it
    ill make the statue move indeed descend
    and take you by the hand but then youll think
    which i protest against i am assisted
    by wicked powers <SENTENCE-END> 
  leontes <SENTENCE-END>  what you can make her do
    i am content to look on what to speak
    i am content to hear for tis as easy
    to make her speak as move <SENTENCE-END>   
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  it is requird
    you do awake your faith <SENTENCE-END>  then all stand still
    or those that think it is unlawful business
    i am about let them depart <SENTENCE-END>

    no foot shall stir <SENTENCE-END> 
  paulina <SENTENCE-END>  music awake her strike <SENTENCE-END>                      music

    dear life redeems you <SENTENCE-END>  you perceive she stirs <SENTENCE-END> 
                         hermione comes down from the pedestal
    start not her actions shall be holy as
    you hear my spell is lawful <SENTENCE-END>  do not shun her

a lovers complaint

by william shakespeare



  from off a hill whose concave womb reworded
  a plaintful story from a sistring vale
  my spirits tattend this double voice accorded
  and down i laid to list the sadtuned tale
  ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
  tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
  storming her world with sorrows wind and rain <SENTENCE-END> 

  upon her head a platted hive of straw
  which fortified her visage from the sun
  whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
  the carcase of a beauty spent and done <SENTENCE-END> 
  time had not scythed all that youth begun
  nor youth all quit but spite of heavens fell rage
  some beauty peeped through lattice of seared age <SENTENCE-END> 

  oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
  which on it had conceited characters
  laundring the silken figures in the brine
  that seasoned woe had pelleted in tears
  and often reading what contents it bears  
  as often shrieking undistinguished woe
  in clamours of all size both high and low <SENTENCE-END> 

  sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride
  as they did battry to the spheres intend
  sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
  to th orbed earth sometimes they do extend
  their view right on anon their gazes lend
  to every place at once and nowhere fixed
  the mind and sight distractedly commixed <SENTENCE-END> 

  her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
  proclaimed in her a careless hand of pride
  for some untucked descended her sheaved hat
  hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
  some in her threaden fillet still did bide
  and true to bondage would not break from thence
  though slackly braided in loose negligence <SENTENCE-END> 

  a thousand favours from a maund she drew  
  of amber crystal and of beaded jet
  which one by one she in a river threw
  upon whose weeping margent she was set
  like usury applying wet to wet
  or monarchs hands that lets not bounty fall
  where want cries some but where excess begs all <SENTENCE-END> 

  of folded schedules had she many a one
  which she perused sighed tore and gave the flood
  cracked many a ring of posied gold and bone
  bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
  found yet moe letters sadly penned in blood
  with sleided silk feat and affectedly
  enswathed and sealed to curious secrecy <SENTENCE-END> 

  these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
  and often kissed and often gan to tear
  cried o false blood thou register of lies
  what unapproved witness dost thou bear
  ink would have seemed more black and damned here  
  this said in top of rage the lines she rents
  big discontents so breaking their contents <SENTENCE-END> 

  a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
  sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
  of court of city and had let go by
  the swiftest hours observed as they flew
  towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
  and privileged by age desires to know
  in brief the grounds and motives of her woe <SENTENCE-END> 

  so slides he down upon his grained bat
  and comely distant sits he by her side
  when he again desires her being sat
  her grievance with his hearing to divide <SENTENCE-END> 
  if that from him there may be aught applied
  which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
  tis promised in the charity of age <SENTENCE-END> 

  father she says though in me you behold  
  the injury of many a blasting hour
  let it not tell your judgement i am old
  not age but sorrow over me hath power <SENTENCE-END> 
  i might as yet have been a spreading flower
  fresh to myself if i had selfapplied
  love to myself and to no love beside <SENTENCE-END> 

  but woe is me too early i attended
  a youthful suit it was to gain my grace
  o one by natures outwards so commended
  that maidens eyes stuck over all his face <SENTENCE-END> 
  love lacked a dwelling and made him her place
  and when in his fair parts she did abide
  she was new lodged and newly deified <SENTENCE-END> 

  his browny locks did hang in crooked curls
  and every light occasion of the wind
  upon his lips their silken parcels hurls <SENTENCE-END> 
  whats sweet to do to do will aptly find
  each eye that saw him did enchant the mind  
  for on his visage was in little drawn
  what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn <SENTENCE-END> 

  small show of man was yet upon his chin
  his phoenix down began but to appear
  like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
  whose bare outbragged the web it seemed to wear
  yet showed his visage by that cost more dear
  and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
  if best were as it was or best without <SENTENCE-END> 

  his qualities were beauteous as his form
  for maidentongued he was and thereof free
  yet if men moved him was he such a storm
  as oft twixt may and april is to see
  when winds breathe sweet unruly though they be <SENTENCE-END> 
  his rudeness so with his authorized youth
  did livery falseness in a pride of truth <SENTENCE-END> 

  well could he ride and often men would say  
  that horse his mettle from his rider takes
  proud of subjection noble by the sway
  what rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes
  and controversy hence a question takes
  whether the horse by him became his deed
  or he his manage by th welldoing steed <SENTENCE-END> 

  but quickly on this side the verdict went
  his real habitude gave life and grace
  to appertainings and to ornament
  accomplished in himself not in his case
  all aids themselves made fairer by their place
  came for additions yet their purposed trim
  pierced not his grace but were all graced by him <SENTENCE-END> 

  so on the tip of his subduing tongue
  all kind of arguments and question deep
  all replication prompt and reason strong
  for his advantage still did wake and sleep <SENTENCE-END> 
  to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep  
  he had the dialect and different skill
  catching all passions in his craft of will

  that he did in the general bosom reign
  of young of old and sexes both enchanted
  to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
  in personal duty following where he haunted <SENTENCE-END> 
  consents bewitched ere he desire have granted
  and dialogued for him what he would say
  asked their own wills and made their wills obey <SENTENCE-END> 

  many there were that did his picture get
  to serve their eyes and in it put their mind
  like fools that in th imagination set
  the goodly objects which abroad they find
  of lands and mansions theirs in thought assigned
  and labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
  than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them <SENTENCE-END> 

  so many have that never touched his hand  
  sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart <SENTENCE-END> 
  my woeful self that did in freedom stand
  and was my own feesimple not in part
  what with his art in youth and youth in art
  threw my affections in his charmed power
  reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower <SENTENCE-END> 

  yet did i not as some my equals did
  demand of him nor being desired yielded
  finding myself in honour so forbid
  with safest distance i mine honour shielded <SENTENCE-END> 
  experience for me many bulwarks builded
  of proofs newbleeding which remained the foil
  of this false jewel and his amorous spoil <SENTENCE-END> 

  but ah who ever shunned by precedent
  the destined ill she must herself assay
  or forced examples gainst her own content
  to put the bypast perils in her way
  counsel may stop awhile what will not stay  
  for when we rage advice is often seen
  by blunting us to make our wills more keen <SENTENCE-END> 

  nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
  that we must curb it upon others proof
  to be forbod the sweets that seems so good
  for fear of harms that preach in our behoof <SENTENCE-END> 
  o appetite from judgement stand aloof
  the one a palate hath that needs will taste
  though reason weep and cry it is thy last <SENTENCE-END> 

  for further i could say this mans untrue
  and knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
  heard where his plants in others orchards grew
  saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
  knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
  thought characters and words merely but art
  and bastards of his foul adulterate heart <SENTENCE-END> 

  and long upon these terms i held my city  
  till thus he gan besiege me gentle maid
  have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
  and be not of my holy vows afraid <SENTENCE-END> 
  thats to ye sworn to none was ever said
  for feasts of love i have been called unto
  till now did neer invite nor never woo <SENTENCE-END> 

  all my offences that abroad you see
  are errors of the blood none of the mind
  love made them not with acture they may be
  where neither party is nor true nor kind <SENTENCE-END> 
  they sought their shame that so their shame did find
  and so much less of shame in me remains
  by how much of me their reproach contains <SENTENCE-END> 

  among the many that mine eyes have seen
  not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed
  or my affection put to th smallest teen
  or any of my leisures ever charmed <SENTENCE-END> 
  harm have i done to them but neer was harmed  
  kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
  and reigned commanding in his monarchy <SENTENCE-END> 

  look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
  of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
  figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
  of grief and blushes aptly understood
  in bloodless white and the encrimsoned mood
  effects of terror and dear modesty
  encamped in hearts but fighting outwardly <SENTENCE-END> 

  and lo behold these talents of their hair
  with twisted metal amorously empleached
  i have receivd from many a several fair
  their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched
  with the annexions of fair gems enriched
  and deepbrained sonnets that did amplify
  each stones dear nature worth and quality <SENTENCE-END> 

  the diamond why twas beautiful and hard  
  whereto his invised properties did tend
  the deepgreen emrald in whose fresh regard
  weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
  the heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend
  with objects manifold each several stone
  with wit well blazoned smiled or made some moan <SENTENCE-END> 

  lo all these trophies of affections hot
  of pensived and subdued desires the tender
  nature hath charged me that i hoard them not
  but yield them up where i myself must render
  that is to you my origin and ender
  for these of force must your oblations be
  since i their altar you enpatron me <SENTENCE-END> 

  o then advance of yours that phraseless hand
  whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
  take all these similes to your own command
  hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise
  what me your minister for you obeys  
  works under you and to your audit comes
  their distract parcels in combined sums <SENTENCE-END> 

  lo this device was sent me from a nun
  or sister sanctified of holiest note
  which late her noble suit in court did shun
  whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
  for she was sought by spirits of richest coat
  but kept cold distance and did thence remove
  to spend her living in eternal love <SENTENCE-END> 

  but o my sweet what labour ist to leave
  the thing we have not mastring what not strives
  playing the place which did no form receive
  playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
  she that her fame so to herself contrives
  the scars of battle scapeth by the flight
  and makes her absence valiant not her might <SENTENCE-END> 

  o pardon me in that my boast is true  
  the accident which brought me to her eye
  upon the moment did her force subdue
  and now she would the caged cloister fly <SENTENCE-END> 
  religious love put out religions eye <SENTENCE-END> 
  not to be tempted would she be immured
  and now to tempt all liberty procured <SENTENCE-END> 

  how mighty then you are o hear me tell
  the broken bosoms that to me belong
  have emptied all their fountains in my well
  and mine i pour your ocean all among <SENTENCE-END> 
  i strong oer them and you oer me being strong
  must for your victory us all congest
  as compound love to physic your cold breast <SENTENCE-END> 

  my parts had powr to charm a sacred nun
  who disciplined ay dieted in grace
  believed her eyes when they tassail begun
  all vows and consecrations giving place
  o most potential love vow bond nor space  
  in thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
  for thou art all and all things else are thine <SENTENCE-END> 

  when thou impressest what are precepts worth
  of stale example when thou wilt inflame
  how coldly those impediments stand forth
  of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
  loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame <SENTENCE-END> 
  and sweetens in the suffring pangs it bears
  the aloes of all forces shocks and fears <SENTENCE-END> 

  now all these hearts that do on mine depend
  feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
  and supplicant their sighs to your extend
  to leave the battry that you make gainst mine
  lending soft audience to my sweet design
  and credent soul to that strongbonded oath
  that shall prefer and undertake my troth <SENTENCE-END> 

  this said his watry eyes he did dismount  
  whose sights till then were levelled on my face
  each cheek a river running from a fount
  with brinish current downward flowed apace <SENTENCE-END> 
  o how the channel to the stream gave grace
  who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
  that flame through water which their hue encloses <SENTENCE-END> 

  o father what a hell of witchcraft lies
  in the small orb of one particular tear
  but with the inundation of the eyes
  what rocky heart to water will not wear
  what breast so cold that is not warmed here
  o cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
  both fire from hence and chill extincture hath <SENTENCE-END> 

  for lo his passion but an art of craft
  even there resolved my reason into tears
  there my white stole of chastity i daffed
  shook off my sober guards and civil fears
  appear to him as he to me appears  
  all melting though our drops this diffrence bore
  his poisoned me and mine did him restore <SENTENCE-END> 

  in him a plenitude of subtle matter
  applied to cautels all strange forms receives
  of burning blushes or of weeping water
  or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
  in eithers aptness as it best deceives
  to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
  or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows

  that not a heart which in his level came
  could scape the hail of his allhurting aim
  showing fair nature is both kind and tame
  and veiled in them did win whom he would maim <SENTENCE-END> 
  against the thing he sought he would exclaim
  when he most burned in heartwished luxury
  he preached pure maid and praised cold chastity <SENTENCE-END> 

  thus merely with the garment of a grace  
  the naked and concealed fiend he covered
  that th unexperient gave the tempter place
  which like a cherubin above them hovered <SENTENCE-END> 
  who young and simple would not be so lovered
  ay me i fell and yet do question make
  what i should do again for such a sake <SENTENCE-END> 

  o that infected moisture of his eye
  o that false fire which in his cheek so glowed
  o that forced thunder from his heart did fly
  o that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowed
  o all that borrowed motion seeming owed
  would yet again betray the forebetrayed
  and new pervert a reconciled maid <SENTENCE-END> 

the end
