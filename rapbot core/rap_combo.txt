Verse 1 SK Laflare
Baby girl what you want to do
Hop in this Cedes girl
She like where we going to
A new life new world
Pop that molly we hardbody
Glocks hot as Kemosabe
He said that he wanted beef
So we fed him hollows and got it popping
Fear and ego is the enemy
You aint got to pretend with me
I need the wool Imma skin the sheep
And take the bull skin it to the meat
You full of shit we in too deep
I do this she knew the deet
Like two feet Flare two time
She wanna kick it like Bruce Lee
Brought you in Ill take you out
Ball like Tim then I weighed it out
Its no work we sling through droughts
The life of me Im just hanging out
Dont get comfortable and lay on the couch
I dont wanna see your ass laying down
Pop that pussy twerk some
Cause most of these bitches work for nothing
Paid your dues while youre Paid In Full
I cant wait to win you wait to lose
Your mind of a failure hate rules
When you settle for what you hate to do
I go the extra mile Im with the extras
Extended clips shoot through your necklace
Leave you breathless that Tec is restless
Cause All My Children need the best bitch
I need that Rothschild money the top is sunny
I seen the light and you blocked it from me
But I found my way to the top Im coming
Got that smackdab base like a rockstar drummer

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Im a problem to niggas
Pop artillery the carbonates with him
Starving to hit em spar with a nigga
Just watch Imma kill em all in a minute
Its the ticketdodging aristocrat
New bitch whip with the system slaps
Mister slide in and skimp the sack
Nigga hit the function with a pick and axe
My nigga miss me with the bullshit
Right here right ear got a Pesto blunt
Why that shit got a young nigga Velcro stuck
Why your bitch go down when the sess go up
Hard as armed services yall might have heard of him
Escobarbarian best call the lawyers up
Bruh the broad Aryan know the squad loiterers
Not with the grain and these bitch niggas wishes
Dealt with addiction fell for the bitch with the
Pale butter skin who just packed up and dipped
In the land of the rentless stand with my chips
In a stack and a grin fuck em

Whats up nigga Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch Whats the problem man Niggas want to hear you rap Dont nobody care about how you feel we want raps nigga

Verse 1 Earl Sweatshirt
My grandmas passing
But Im too busy tryna get this fuckin album cracking to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen Cut that bitch off
And my priorities fucked up I know it Im afraid Im going to blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet right
Talk all you want Im taking no advice nigga
Im bout to relish in this anguish and Im stressing over payment
So dont tell me that I made it only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado misfitted Im Clark Gable

Heart racing til blunt is lit like He dont give a fuck again right

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
I dont fuck with too much of yalls shit
Judging by the pants and the mall grip
Gully in the vans with the dark tints
Im a startshit type nigga
Night life living
Riding in the Jeep Imma sideswipe niggas
Whats your life like Thats alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isnt
Right got the whip and I aint got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it
The nicest doin it who the fuck you staring at
Acting like youve never seen a tooth thats caratcapped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin these niggas gon flop like Divac
See that nigga And for the time being
Imma be that nigga believe that nigga
You see that nigga And for the time being
Imma be that nigga believe that nigga

Verse 1 Domo Genesis
Look for me lost in a whirlwind 2012 quality
High up until the world ends doing eightyfive in my ride
And these niggas hiding know Im striding like a giant
I aint lying when Im rhyming rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn Doms it dont even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify em couldnt crack him Im a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure Im still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted hope your head explode
Cry about it but dont deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low pulling on the killer dro
Chilling with a vixen thinking This is what I did it for
Still banging Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didnt know
Still trifling Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing ho

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
While they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
Im shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns pattycaking with mannequins
Cause I dont like my fucking homies dip bruh they all
Jawslacking all em awe struck
And I aint got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony smoking spliffs
And thats prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit
And can a real nigga get a look at it Crook panicshook
Aint ya Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing fit the cook apron ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy running til my foot aching
Fullgrown terror type Ferragamo dorag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui running twomans
Smoking till Im loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But Imma dip I know you must have had it with my rude ass

Verse 1 Earl Sweatshirt
I know it dont seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into and I aint havin it
And we both know that I dont mean to offend you Im just focused today
And I dont know why its difficult to admit that I miss you
And I dont know why we argue and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you Im sorry the music makes me dismissive
When Im awake Im just drifting Im not complaining
Its just to say that I stay pretty busy lately
And I could be misbehaving I just hang with my niggas
Im fuckin famous if you forgot Im faithful
Despite all whats in my face and my pocketand this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit on cloudy days when Im salty
I play the hate to the Logic
State to state for the profit it aint a stain on me nigga
My momma raised me a profit I play for dollar incentive
And where Im walking its studded and halfretarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance I know the dark isnt coming
For the moment if I could hold it
She she seems that

Hook Earl Sweatshirt
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different I dont like you a lot
You see it seems like

Verse 2 Frank Ocean
Im coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat left you at terminal three
Ill meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks a fortnight
And you parade my homecoming dont cry
You know I cant live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac I could get high every day
But Id be sleepy OCD and paranoid so
Give me Bali beach no molly please
Palm no marijuana trees
Your hickies on my aorta and tattoos you could only see
When Im playing surfboarder put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you thinks cool
They thought me soft in High School thank God Im jagged
Forgot you dont like it rough I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon be when Im aiming my gun
And whys his mug all bloody that was a three on one
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit Im not supposed to be stunting
Its all melodic this song I catch this vibe in my sleep
But Im just jetlagged is all and restless

Hook Frank Ocean
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving yous a little different I dont like you a lot

Outro
I dont know what were about
What good is West Coast weather if youre bipolar
If Imma need this sweater Id rather be where its cold
Where it snows I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls I know theyre coming in droves
Youll only miss when it goes
Yeah I think thats it
When it goes

VERIFIED COMMENTARY BY
Vince Staples
    
Verse 1 Earl Sweatshirt
Promise Heron Ill put my fist up after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck maybe a gold chain
With that fucking flow that ssso belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold hardly fucking with these niggas nigga listen
The description doesnt fit if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it in turn these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spitted just burn like six furnaces
Writ it affixed learning them digits
And simultaneously dispelling onetrickpony myths isnt he
One adolescent fucking sixnigga energy
And crawling down Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting thrashing
These niggas done let the Kraken out
Crackalacking like snap crackle popping your ammo off
Hide your face and throw your flannels off Sweatshirt nigga

Hook Casey Veggies  Earl Sweatshirt
87 roof top Bronson
Whipping hoopties tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth double scoop hock vomit up
Sub rocking thud knocking niggas teeth loose
Bruh I dont fuck with no cop
Rolling with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top
Rapping to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothing with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights focused
Like its nothing cause its nothing bitch

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
From a city thats recessionhit
With stress niggas could flex metal with
Peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyllish
But most niggas Hyde and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news deaths less important when the Lakers lose
Its lead in that baby food heads try to make it through
Fishnetted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit eye in the pyramid
God spit it like its truth serum in that beer and then
Disappear again reappear bearded
On top of a lear steering it into the kids ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the blacktop
Salivary glands lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking wait wait who the fuck you badder than
Boy oh boy Im bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick nimble rickrolling
Bitch niggas pick litter piffblower plus I pillage shit

Verse 3 Vince Staples
Quit with all that tough talk
Bruh we know you niggas aint about shit
Come around we gun em down bodies piled Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits weapons concealed Im ready to kill
So test it all my weapons is real
Selling thizz couldnt tell him what the recipe is
Got em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwing out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words Im getting money
Lil Boy told me when its time to ride theyll send up for me
Aint nobody scaring me
Niggas aint prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks the way I cue shit
If this was 88 I would have signed to Ruthless
94 wouldve had em walking down Death Row
First is when the best go hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me Wet em if they test you
So its Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until its only God they seeing
Kitten soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy
I dont believe it but to each his own
I aint tripping long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas police pass
Tell em Free Smalls off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J bony niggas spraying Ks
Ruger with the pork face Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet Coldchain

Chorus
Something sinister to it pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals stealth
Welcome to enemy turf harder than immigrants work
Golf is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche psyche

Interlude
Can I get that oh let me get that beat in my headphones louder

Verse 1
Its probably been twelve years since my father left left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen Im hollow intolerant skip shots
I storm that whole bottle Ill show you a role model
Im drunk pissy pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think wheeze cough scoffing and hes off again
Searching for a big brother Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
Im indecisive Im scatterbrained and Im frightened its evident
In them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at

Chorus
Something sinister to it pendulum swinging slow

Welcome to enemy turf harder than immigrants work

Interlude

Verse 2
Uh time lapse bars rotten hearts bottomless pit
Was mobbin deep as 96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome trying to make it from the bottom of Syds
Feeling as hard as Vince Carters knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with zine article
Tolerance for boundaries I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it like I like attention
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful right Like Thanks so much you made my life
Harder and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

Chorus
Something sinister to it pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals stealth
Welcome to enemy turf harder than immigrants work
Golf is stitched into my shirt

Verse 1 Tyler the Creator
After filling my reputation of whore beaters
Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas
Mmm thats good Wanted four more ordered em then eat em
Then head to Thebes house for some gymnastics
Fantastic I backflip on this beat B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberries on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joes old Dominos
Fuck it whatever
Um Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues they cant handle us
They cant stand us including fruits that Franks channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is
Man I suck now I aint still dope
But Chris and Rihannas fuckin again so theres still hope
Oh fuck I went there balling bitch Im Bens hair
Yall barely breaking like Tacos selfesteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap yeah this grins rare
Watch a nigga smile like fiveyearold child
Im kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile its
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
Thats just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago
Dont let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches thats vile
They never did catch that rhino

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all its autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Noncooperative with his mommas wishes for college
And coppers labeled a problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp nigga follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch got jumped dusted off and then walked home
Shit its like 6 PM and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is only slightly
Write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped
Man these stitches shut the loose lips stumbled in a Ruths Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route we on the second season now
Small fry got em seasons salty weeded coughing
Ease up off me end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off believe its Golf Wang nigga

Yeah me Yeah yeah yeah Im just tryna say somethin before I I drop it off

Verse 1 Vince Staples
I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed we will kill niggas
So try me if you want bruh I promise Im with all of that
Late night shooters got em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white mans game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus I cant wait
Until the money coming in spend it all on guns and rims
I aint nothing but a nigga aint no reason to pretend

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Kept his sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask bloody Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles sold sniff Momma knew
Baggies laying round peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshotll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two plotting trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch stiff collar on the buttonup
Hood rich wild and bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement covered trussled drugs toughen up

Hook
Well alright okay If thats how you truly feel about it then
Alright okay If thats how you truly feel about it then

Verse 3 Earl Sweatshirt
Vinny Stape they stupid think the city safe
Until that little bindi placed headshots red dot
Block as hot as Denny plates fed watch Fed watch
Opinions only pity based deep in the Civic with the
Evilest niggas this side of the Mississippi
All courtesy of Vincent from niggas who plot against
EarLdoubleS hear shells from the Tec
Hear in fulleffect eat a dick and cut a check bitch
Few niggas Im on a firstname basis with
Address him by the alias that trunk weighted like he
Bout to catch a case again eighths louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him bruh Im caking
Whether Hell or bad weather high water Im a sailortype
Assailant for the paper living like I met the maker twice
Hit it til Im faded right Mami take a hike
Or treat it like you fucking shaking dice bitch

Hook
Well alright okay If thats how you truly feel about it then
Alright okay If thats how you truly feel about it then

Salmon skin BandAid help with recovery
Diction buttery grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed pucker up kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt
Killing who you send in first verse wintergreen spit it show em that I meant it
Ho Im rolling with my niggas find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage throw a brick and pour the Henny
Dont defend it its useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal I hit the Jake threw the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit leave the bank broke
Sliding in she smiling and fidgeting pull my face close
Streaming down the street from what roma was stank though
Product of the villainy product capable plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain broke

Verse 1 Mac Miller
Said this a hit of liquid heroin
Marilyn Manson channeling panicking spar with Anakin
til one of us leave in an ambulance
Blow the smoke of the spliff in your eyes
You aint gon live til you die
Intelligent bitch on my side
She bitching Im spitting habitual lies
I hit her up when my jet land
Got a swisher tucked in my headband
Front page news Im young Jesus
Eating bagels with no cable on
Been fucking hoes since when Mase was on
I hope that Based God hear my prayers
One day youre here the next day youre gone
So me and Earl smoking weed on Jay Zs lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass Tony Womack
Dont hold back no feed your girl Cognac
Meet a bitch sleeping wit her feverish diva chick
Met her off Twitter even Schindler keeps a list
Pittsburgh broke down somewhere in a Fisker
I could pull your bitch with a whisper and diss her
Dumbass ho
She only dumb cause she love that though
Somewhere getting high reading Juxtapoz
I hit her up she come through and watch Adjustment Bureau
Thats a good movie
Moms love me cause Im so commercial
I fuck em raw cause I know they fertile
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece
Hotel lobbies playing Fr Elise
Im Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me
I said Joshs beard is like Paul Revere
When he walk in the room its like God is here
Im at a prop shop in Montauk throwing tomohawks
At civilians Im chilling

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Im on the monitor nigga
She taking it like a champ
And Im proud of her nigga
Im on the couch where that loud is burning
Im shouting I dont fuck with you
Cause I dont never love a ho
But we could play doctor ma
Open wide for thermometer
Your cowgirls crotch riding
With a clean faded fro lopsided
Tell the label that I want a white driver
And tell him give me space I dont know that nigga
Boldass little fuckin lowclass villian
Whole van tinted nope cant kill him
Its the Trashwang nigga thats whats up
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup
Real nigga from the start til the casket shut
Present his own case as a basket one
Presentday based nigga smack the judge
Riding with them same niggas ashin blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin
Slide in the safe take the cash and run
Know that if he fake Im harrassin him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin like Im supposed to dog
Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I holds menthol
Its Wolf Gang bitch like you know these paws
Living like its 62
Spit and grip my genitals
My bitch to split the swisher
My niggas split the residuals

Ragged with the contra Phantom of the Opera
And Im standing on the cops truck stacking for the long run
The bags packed roadside with the thumb out
Toe tagged dont gag fag spit your gum out
Nomadic chromegrabbing when its danger
Im a mangerborn puppy holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea spit scabies and bet

Like Fuck is beef Get your cattle cut pansy
If them fans only local why them flights transatlantied up
The rice and the pattys cooked nice for the chancellor
Them teeth with the gold bright the light switches mad at us
Snap chatting panty clad baddies Im a bachelor

And write with the same hand I smack em up with
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially

Verse 1 Earl Sweatshirt
Grab mittens who have to spit blizzardous
Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment eight nickels of hash delay quick and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Raquets you play tennis with hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis an antagonist Dandappered up
Vagabond had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong momma and some food beer tag along
Get a nice spanking new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop dead and wrong
Get em higher than the pitch of metal teakettle songs

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Yeah the misadventures of a shittalker
Pissed as Rick Rosss fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it Like a blue pill make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick chronic thrift shopper thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs posture
Pen Naw probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues more food and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens scoot em to a ditch chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid thought it up jot it quick 
Thaw it out toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Verse 1
Gorgeous chromeplated horse whip
Homemaking paintings for poorquality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdicts still saucy
Sack swinging like DubD40 on a door hinge
Good lord walk light like the floor slick
Look bored hoard all mics in a force grip
Proabortion endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clinched emulating 68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle til he middle aged and limpsticked
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliffs lit
Dismissed feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun
Crazy heart hazy lung making art raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palins son

No home for the weak

I sit in thought til the flow is right
Then throw some D on all available open mics
Smoke it right proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet bowl with a broken pipe
Shit the former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed so the role was switched
Now Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
Look whos as useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early man you posers know me as the troll throwing moldy
Donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies whip
Eating like the kids when you take em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over
Tracks damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper bout as thick as tips of pencils is missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good fingerlickin bitch
Bet its thirtysix fish netted like the hook was inefficient

Verse 1 Domo Genesis
Guess with a few exceptions yeah Im living honest
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college started chasing profit
Sorry ma I aint forget about it but if money evil
Im hoping that you could see through all the drama and watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot its like Im bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I dont even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I dont need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal highlevel full throttle shit
Still searching for a reason why niggas aint acknowledge this
Im lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I need the sway of things Im everyday cooling it
Im getting blazed and laughing at the way they overdoing shit
Im just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit Im truly too legit to quit

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Id like to send a shout to the fathers that didnt raise us
To every hoe who hated now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments a nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I havent yet made up
Black Cressida pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles
Kenny rolling blunts got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit ironic cause the audios
As nautical as ships look momma look momma
Look your product is legit I promise honest
This karma got me balling up my fist
Til I demolish your clique pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets
Regardless of who is talking Im farming harvesting hits
Just me and Domo one lit marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up
So searching for a way to state it right
Young black and jaded vision hazy strolling through the night

Verse 1
Yo Im a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets and laugh it off
Twisted sicker than mad cattle in fact Im off
Six different liquors with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming bitch you shouldnt be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic armed with an addicts arm
Earl puts the ass in assassin
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that Im so haphazardous
Ill puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
Im askin that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this classact shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel
Slip capsules in a glass she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled asking where her ass go
In my room redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on suck it up but hurry I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin uppercut
Its OF buttercup go ahead fuck with us
Without a doubt a surefire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch as well as supper
Then Ill rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice somethings up
What you doing  nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce guess the bouncers had enough of us

Verse 2
Get up off the pavement wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hating but them faggots is a lot of talk
Cotton soft pussy them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails fucking toss one in your apartment dog

Try talking on a blog with your fucking arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off

Things changed when I hassled back so David hit the pavement
With this grapple rap Snapple fact you rather wack
While I am poppin like a snappin crack
So high you could see like Tallahass the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milkin cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezin boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split dont act surprised agree with it
The gang of wolves that creeps in crypts
As deep as Dawsons Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills why you think Im posted boastin
Braggin tell these faggots to stop naggin
Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

Verse 2 Tyler
Uh was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didnt cross the line until the bridge hit it troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin yall with no lubricant go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church now Im the newest sermon
Wearin nothin but they fuckin blast with the matchin turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swervin
Hittin curbs and blastin Erick Sermon drunk off English bourbon
Im stealin purses rapin nurses Im a crooked surgeon
And treat the beat like sanitized nazi puss Im a German
Im squirtin while Im masturbatin and regurgitatin
From eatin Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like exconvict community service

Verse 3 Earl
Im back on my sixty six sick shit
Flowin like the blood out the competitions slit wrists
She lick it up Dracula then spit it back back at ya
She mad as fuck stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers now you aint laughin huh

Verse 4 Tyler
Bitch youre barely breathin leavin on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt  wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed off her arm and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin awesome spittin box of trees got you niggas
Shakin like its Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarksons dick
Ironin you niggas now its time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet pull my knife out
Sharpen it stab him put a arch on it
Pour unleaded gas on him get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track the faggot shouldnt have started it

Ma said Wake up son good morning
I rolled out of bed greeted mama with a yawn then
Paused to scratch an itch and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head school was to be attended shit
I paid my thoughts no attention cause I wasnt tryna kick it
With this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasnt havin it so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that Id rather kick
It seems kinda brash but its the hash I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit shes the jock Im the horseshoe
Shes gorgeous when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left it didnt break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
Id pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushing through my body
But you got a guy thats not me so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on lets cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps a chance is all Im really asking for
Give me one I promise Ill be back for more
Most wanna tap and score I want a fam of four

Interlude
Not like a family of four just like fuck it
Youll never listen to this shit anyways fuck you bitch

Verse 2
She said You rushing you rabid son of a Labrador
But Im attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple Stores
The basement light is darkened the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two percent carton
See her face while youre fixing your breakfast
And know shes in my basement objecting to sex with
Me murder spree surges on with the next bitch
Tombstones read RIP cause its pieces they rest in

And you wouldnt be sitting boohooing bout your bruises
But no you wanna be Miss FuckwiththeMusic

Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too in the back look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red white blue lights in the rearview shit
Swerved to the shoulder tell them both no moving
Sit down in the back cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
Arent you a little too young to be driving
Look Officer Im just tryna get home
Get out the fucking car with your license and registration
I aint getting outta shit youre starting to try my patience
Didnt have backup I could tell by the Hummingbike

Stabbed him in his neck and hip threw him in the trunk and dipped

Started thinking about a normal life it got me suicidal
Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang hocking loogies in a bible
Dancing with the devil tonights our first recital
His hands on my hips he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass and I dont know what Im doing
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight

Verse 2 Hodgy Beats
I live all over my roomies a bum
Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She asking me to dance I ask for my pants
Ended up with an argument sirens ambulance
Scratch her off my list the situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah I aint Nas get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it Im hating the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillings all through my vampire teeth saber
Ahh Jesus please She screams for her savior
A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up
I need to eat place to sleep new shoes aging feet
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet

Didnt know her but Im confirming that she sure gurgled dick

As hungry as a cannibal trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite hoes know Im coming

My absence of fucks was a problem that we aint ever
Really get to solve we just smashed and we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you

Raised neck and neck with Nak so Im a fluent brawler
Rain checkin on ya plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster I gotta focus my family problems
Shrunk and widen with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt cause I cant keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didnt surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Cant put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile never change Im stupid for tryin
Still just too busy wildin still

And I dont know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po
When I run dont chase me

Intro
Alright
Uh uh uh

Hook
Good grief I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga I aint been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating but we see you getting cooked nigga

Verse 1
I dont act hard Im a hard act to follow nigga
Like it or not when it drop bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons tryna make it happen on a mission
Step into the shadows we could talk addiction
When its harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Dont give a fuck pardon me for going into details
376 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter aint as frantic as my thoughts
Lately Ive been panicking a lot
Feeling like Im stranded in a mob scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand
Steady handling my job time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas you turning into tricks
I was making waves you was surfing in em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent niggas shit
Bitch

Verse 2
My fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment high as fuck
Ive been alone in my shit for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Momma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs riding in em
Im a target so its hard to even eye me in em
If he aint dying for me then I aint riding with him
Theres no time for that
Making sure my man wallets straight
Like a collar when you iron that
Thinking bout my grandmama find a bottle
Imma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone you cant buy em back

How you doing And whats your motive ho
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em
Trying to pay my momma rent figure thats just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin easy down this narrow path beefin with your scary ass
Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga thats a great lunch
Poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news my nigga we dont do the same stuff
Kiwis couldnt take us boy Im jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change I separated from my main one
Its just another day another niggas bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was
Little mad nigga missing dad never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Dah with me he sipping on some maple leaf
Im only happy when theres static in the air
Cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think its sweet never bitches funny boy
You berries and you honey for the bear thats here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands make it hasty
I hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from me

So whyd they evict you bro

Verse 1 Earl Sweatshirt  Dah
Feel this cage when that acid fade
Face the same but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors guess he isnt home
Probably cause that fucking faith I didnt show
Skipping church flip the work
Hit the dirt like Tommy Drummond bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasnt in
Came up off of work that my conscience wasnt in
Either way it goes a lot is getting hit
And if it wasnt hoes then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul and my posse on my skin
Sweaty DADolla top lotto picks
Promise that Im not the one to fucking plot against
Love him but my father aint my motherfucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a motherfucking end
Huh trend dodging keep a bitch by me bank roll
Garbage bag full of sins cleanse my soul to rap still nigga
Cash is in hand packs get vac sealed like the Tin Man
Cardiac still missing is it past real get it work make Guinness

Hook Earl Sweatshirt
Dont know where Im going dont know where I been
Never trust these hoes cant even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up you fucking with some grown ups
Dont know where Im going dont know where I been
Never trust these hoes cant even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up you fucking with some grown ups

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt  Dah
My mama wonder why I never seem to reach her
See my daddy in the way Im acting and my facial features
Just trying to put you on dawg I came from teachers
Take the plate and clean it nigga Im a dog
Tell her hit or miss me with the fucking monologue
Lord I cant fight it know Im tryna brawl
Get a copper hauled off shit
Im the type of nigga that you cop your raw off
Popping whores off
Grab the ball and these niggas call charge
Team switching jerseys like its All Star
Press the OnStar think we all lost

Verse 1 Wiki
Nineteen still gettin kicked out the crib
Ripped off my bib spit out my food hiccup and piss
Urine burnin I could smell the liquor in this
Cats always tryna pick up the fistDuff this dude out
Rappers stoop just to get to your crib
Now its like bruised face loose walk too sauced
Distraught thoughts on my corpse on the asphalt
Back when Id slack off rock my slacks of my ass halfoff
Every time I rap I blastoff
Back when I catch court I always had sports
Dippin on cops in my track shorts
So tell my mom I had to make it right
I lie every night about the limelight so I could lie at night
And tell my pops I gotta take advice
Keep my head screwed on tight abuse these mics
See me Im the contusion type
A cat to smack the mic
Against my fuckin head when Im losing hype
RATKING never losing hype no
Smack king and I do it right no
RATKING yeah I do it nice woah

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Bitch I skated before I rapped
If you take me before your captain bet 20 hots on your daddy
That someone could Noila Clap em probably cold and passive
Cause pops was the one that got to me feeling down like he passed it
And when Im cornered its action I was kinda out the game
Momma put the quarter right back in the slot
In 09 we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block
Bitch if yo nigga had Supreme we was the reason he copped it
And nowadays Im on the hunt for mirrors to box with
And some pretty bitches that aint trip if its a hit and run
I got the gold cause I dont do the crying bro
She Mario Im tryna keep the whining to a minimum
Piggies come bet Im splittin quicker than I finish rum
Find me some Indica nuggets on my fingers
And my shirt like they was chicken crumbs
The room spinnin finna yak if I dont hit the blunt
Got the chin waggin slim chances of me getting up
After this mind in the trash next to where my fuckin passion went
Dodge fanatics halfaXanax when Im traveling
Six hours or more brick out on the tour
Got kicked out of the morgue spit cattle manure shit
Shit rally the Horsemen tally the corpses

Verse 1
Fresh out the belly of the island into the heart of the city
T and them just hit the road I had Sage and Nak and em with me
I thought the fauna was pretty so I approached her I did
My first apartment was really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape Catch a wave now you in the industry ocean
Missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish home gets distant
We working Im on the road again
Cold and the spirits is bursting up out the Trojan man
Fridge full of spirits in the crib mirror mirror
Let me hear why the niggas thats the peers see and hear us
Then mimic the fucking motions man
Keep the circle close let them niggas front in the culdesacs
Friendly with the chosen the rest is getting the poker hand
Facedrinking smoker it help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping til I melt
Devil trying me Im dodging falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When its problems I dont holler rather fix em on myself
When its looking like its quiet for you this the shit to yell
This the shit right yup keep your chin high up
Cause when she aint fucking with you then her friend might
Let you get up inside yup let this shit ride yup
You dont get it rocking like we do on this side nigga

Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like rale

Momma shouldve told you itd be days like this
Its just a tale from the crip
Im on my sance shit Im tryna make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some AI shit
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch a lot of lotto picks lost
Inside this game we call rap I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead it exit out his under arm
Aint nobody bigger than my hood my nigga fuck a boss
Baby momma killer you offended and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doin federal time for bustin at the law
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine you play me for a pawn
Shorty I be swimmin with sharks your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen when the pastor say

Verse 2 Earl Sweatshirt
Its Golf on thatbitch its Golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tall boy Jehovah aint call back
And yall still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy
Peanut butter to paisley walking down the street
In the different color McGradys that first grader was me
Now my fist full of spliffs and the old banker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef dry
Im taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up boy you dancing with a demon
On my mama I been limiting my features filling swishers up with reefer
Bitch its difficult to beat him like a soft dick
Golf clique deep and we dont hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy K brought the matches
Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag and then
Switch to a different fuckin whip to let them piggies speed past em
Its the rats try and get the cheese
What it do Rap like Im mincing meat
Call me Lou if Im on the track these niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me bitches feel some type of way for me
50s in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket he gon pop it when its danger round
Fingertips to tapers now salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now

You walkin around like you invincible
You dropped outta school you lost your principles
I know people backstab you I felt bad too
But this fuck everybody attitude aint natural
But you aint a saint this aint kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by Ye
You gave him 20 million without blinkin
He gave you 20 minutes on stage fuck was he thinkin
Fuck wrong with everybody is what you sayin
But if everybodys crazy youre the one thats insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records

Let go your ego over your right shoulder

In the future other niggas playin football with your son

Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin babies see a sacrifice
Mama had four kids but shes a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that shes a thespian
Had to hide in the closet so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Dont matter to me if its a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette baby let em eat cake

I know you often heard me wax poetic
Bout bein back in the Lexus
But trust me that was nothin a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions I have no ceilings
Ah this that feelin Im that boy
Anita Bakers You Bring Me Joy slappin out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rearview mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah I was born with a pair playin for high stakes
Normans Cay he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas cant relate
Fuck a slice of the apple pie want my own cake
In charge of my own fate respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin for power huh
So our music is ours niggas own their own houses
Ours was Fuck you pay me
Now its Fuck payin me I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue
That blood money I giggle at it
Cant even support my miss habit
Jewelry shoppin in Pa all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh blood diamonds drippin with guilt I still aint trippin
Thats life winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said Prehaps I Freudian slipped in European whips
God sent me to break the chain Im the true and livin
God in the flesh the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit inferior IQ
Niggasll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh what did I do Cept try to free you
Niggasll love you but hate you cause they cant be you
Dump em all in the bayou uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku huh
But my storys too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh these that drugs heron flow I spaz on the stove
This is Hov no flex zone nigga who lied to you
Look you a pedestrian dont ever question the security I provided you
Oh yall thought I was washed Im at the cleaners
Launderin dirty money like the Teamsters huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home he in the church
When I heard you got booked that shit hurt
Fear for you bro we know the system dont work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet its legal in Colorado yet we deny
Black entrepreneurs free enterprise
Thats why its a black market thats why its called the trap
Thats why its called the projects cause its exactly that
All these people was gon kill me heh
Cause the more I reveal me the more they fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter smile

Outro Gloria Carter
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because thats what you want them to see
Living two lives happy but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say its time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them no harm for me
But life is short and its time to be free
Love who you love because life isnt guaranteed

You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters dont give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act bruh
Yall body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I
My crash course was much tougher

Then hug their friends mothers
And show up at the funeral complete with blank stares
Invisible ink I had to read things that wasnt there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a sideeye in my sleep

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
Im letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away

Verse 1 JAYZ
Look I apologize often womanize
Took for my child to be born see through a womans eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song I dont deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
Please pick up the phone pick up the phone
I said Dont embarrass me instead of Be mine
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me I wasnt ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasnt present
Your body wouldnt accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say Im all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

Verse 2 JAYZ
I apologize our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay til our backs burn
Were supposed to laugh til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didnt know
I promised I cried I couldnt hold
I suck at love I think I need a doover
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit

Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh

Verse 3 JAYZ
And if my children knew
I dont even know what I would do
If they aint look at me the same
I would probly die with all the shame
You did what with who
What good is a mnage  trois when you have a soulmate
You risked that for Blue
If I wasnt a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blues tooth the tooth fairy didnt pay

Verse 1 JAYZ  Beyonc
Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin the kids liquid gold

Kid that used to pitch bricks cant be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh we gon reach a billi first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah I run through em all
Hovis home all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
Youd rather be old rich me or new you
And old niggas yall stop actin brand new
Like 2Pac aint have a nose ring too huh
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash cant fit into Steve Harveys suit
Im clear why Im here how about you
Aint no such thing as an ugly billionaire Im cute
Mmmmm Pretty much
If anybody gettin handsome checks it should be us

Nah we did that Blackowned things
Hundred percent Blackowned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin off these streams
Yall still drinkin PerrierJout hah

Yall stop me when I stop tellin the truth

Interlude JAYZ  Beyonc

Verse 2 JAYZ
Yeah Ill fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone Becky
A man that dont take care his family cant be rich
Ill watch Godfather I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michaels common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin off through the curtains cause she hurtin
Kay losin the babies cause their futures uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed cause we never had the tools
Im tryna fix you
Im tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Yall think small I think Biggie
Yall whole pass is in danger ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby sposed to help me
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
Whats better than one billionaire Two

A nice peacefund ideas from people who look like we
We gon start a society within a society
Thats major just like the Negro League
There was a time America wouldnt let us ball

Verse 2
You see my father son of a preacher man
Whose daughter couldnt escape the reach of the preachers hand
That charge of energy set all the Carters back
It took all these years to get to zero in fact
I hated religion cause here was this Christian
He was preachin on Sundays versus how he was livin Monday
Someday I forgive him
Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
I studied Muslim Buddhist and Christians
And I was runnin from him He was givin me wisdom
See how the universe works
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
Its a gift and a curse
Thats called the Red Queens Race

Speeches I prepared that I never spoke
Words on a paper that I never read
Proses never penned they stayed in my head
Jotted on dotted lines Ima fight you nigga
From stories that I heard Im just like you nigga
Mustve been some pain in your past too
Mustve been a karma that was past due
Must it be the energy that passed through
Mustve been a pastor many snafus
Started a good man you married my mama
I was in her belly you hurried that Summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family I dont believe in halfsisters
Never treated my brother like a step Pop
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out

Chorus
What was you preparing us for

Verse 2
Did you see the runt as the frontrunner
Leader of the pack you see that in your youngins
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed what you need to take from em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldnt function
Shot junk in your arms more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings cause you said you was coming
You couldnt kick the habit I wish you said something
You cant avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh just tell him your plans
Who wouldve thought Id be the dad I never had
Be the husband Ive become usually nothing come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
Im just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap

Verse 1 JAYZ
Look at all we been through since last August
Skating through the rumors like Aw shit
Still came back fucked up the red carpet
Shows how big your heart is
On the Run we took a hundred together
More than the money it was the fact that we done it together
Uh healing in real time
Song Cry to Resentment that was real crying
Bonnie and Clyde things we hold it down
Had we surrendered then thatd be the real crime
Got through it got blessed times two with it
New BelAir estates with four pools in it
I told my bro You gotta go home over vino
Goodfella dont gamble with your life this aint Casino
Cost him two mill plus the child support
Well get the money back but not the child support
Its getting too late we cant afford mistakes
Woulda broke me down had you got away
It woulda broke me up you took my child away
Im glad we found a way
Sexin the pain away
Vacay the pain away
Drinking the pain away
Smoking the pain away

Verse 2 James Blake  JAYZ
Too perfect not to wonder yeah
If we created a flame that would warm us til its over

I promise to repair with gold each bowl I drop

Your gangster is not defined
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist but more how your genes stand up to their expectations
Your gangster
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch
But rather how many rocks you move while owning watch
Gangsters hustlers republicans democrats pimps and hoes
Conservatives labor
The seller the buyerthe product the producer
See you are what you are in this world
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that dont understand the laws that govern the gangsterment
Gangsterment gangsterment
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws
And create brand new words gangster mentality
Gangster mentality an American way created by the white
Mastered by the black and absorbed by the fiends
Taxed by the governmentality governmentality governmentality
Charted by Forbes if you believe in JayZ
Then you too can be a gangster then you too can be a gangster
By any means necessary by owning that dream
I mean its a long walk to freedom
But while deep deep deep inside the bush
The war on terror screams damn it feels good
Damn it feels good to be a gangster haha
To be a gangster swagger is not a must its a liability
A clich a bad suit cut the bullshit
You know if it wasnt for this there would be no that

Deliver me from the work of iniquity
And save me from the Bloody Men

Verse 1 JayZ
Look mind state of a gangster from the 40s
Meets the business mind of Motowns Berry Gordy
Turned crack rock into a chain of 4040s
Sorry my jewelrys so gaudy
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauris
America meet the gangster Shawn Corey
Hey young world wanna hear a story
Close your eyes and you can pretend youre me
Im cut from the cloth of the Kennedies
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother Americas not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed black businesses
This is the tale of lost innocence
As the incense burn and the turntables turn
And that Al Green plays
I see my mothers afro
As Mama taps her toes as she rolls her Js
And my papa just left the house
In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray
And shes trying to calm her nerves
As I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store
We can never be sure so all we can do is pray

Break Beyonc
Because of your strength
While I walked upon thee
For God is my defense pray for me

Verse 2 JayZ
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go Vroom
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask Why you laughing They say Youre too little
One day youll understand when you become a man
About things you have to get you
Fast forward freeze frame on my pistol
Fistful of dollars ignorance is so blissful
I didnt choose this life this life chose me
Around here its the shit that you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn screaming Just move
Or is there something else you suggest we can do
He made his way to the trunk opened it like Huh
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said hell be back next month
What we called corrupt he calls paying dues
Now when the rules is blurred
As they is and were what am I to do
But pray Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me by for what Im bout to go through pray

Break Beyonc
Deliver me in thy righteousness
And cause me to escape
And climb thine air unto me
Save me thine Lord pray for me

Verse 3 JayZ
Geah anywhere theres oppression and the drug profession
Flourishes like beverages refreshing ahhh
Sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer or victim I beg
What came first Moving chickens or the egg
This is why I be so fresh
Im trying to beat life cause I cant cheat death
Treat shame with shamelessness
Aim stainlesses at anuses you know the game this is
Move coke like Pepsi dont matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do Im a man behind mine
Im not an angel Im sure but every night before I lay
I drop my knees to the floor and I pray

Outro Beyonc
The name shall endure forever
The name shall be continued as long as the sun pray for me
Men shall be blessed in Him
All nations shall call Him blessed
In your name I pray pray for me
Lord bless us

We need a place to pitch we need a mound
For now Im just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my LaZBoy
In the clouds of smoke been playing this Marvin
Mama forgive me should be thinking about Harvard
But thats too far away niggas are starving
Nothing wrong with my aim just gotta change the target
I got dreams of bagging sniddow the size of pillows

Lifes a bitch I hope to not make her a widow

Step one in this process scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that youre not from the precinct
Please speak slow cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight hes going to give you consignment
Youre now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts I wish you well  hold up
Survive the droughts I wish you well
How sick am I I wish you health
I wish you wheels I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
And the cops is coming you could read they mind
You could see from behind you could redefine
The game as we know it one dream at a time
Im American dreamin

Intro Denzel Washington from American Gangster
Most important thing in business is honesty integrity
Hard work family
Never forgetting where we came from

Verse 1
Poor me dad was gone finally got my dad back
Liver bad he wouldnt live long that snatched my dad back
Guidance I never had that streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at matter of fact I learned it all
Burned it all this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back not having much not having that
Had to get some challah bread so you can holla back and
Holla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of lettin my cash stack
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rattattattat
Own boss own your masters slaves
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich lets get wealthy who else gon feed we
If I need it Ima get it however God help me
And I dont need no hook for this shiiiit

Verse 2
Im so fa sho its no facade
Stay outta trouble momma said as momma sighed
Her fear her youngest son be a victim of homicide
But I gotta get you outta here momma or Ima die inside
And either way you lose me momma so let loose of me
I got the rein our direction will soon change
To live and die in NY in the hustle game
Hustle caine hustle clothes I hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga toothpick but but I do lift
Weight like Im using roids
RollsRoyce keep my movements smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape
And I dont need no hook for this shiiiit

Verse 3
This is not for commercial usage
Please dont categorize this as music
Please dont compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers Im more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Ludas my dude I aint trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool but I aint trying to snitch
Ima follow the rules no matter how much time Ima get
Ima live and die with the decisions that Ima pick
So fuck DeHaven for caving thats why we dont speak
Made men aint supposed to make statements
End of the story I followed the code cracked the safe
Other niggas aint in the game so they practice hate
Leave that boy Hov alone why dont cha
You dont have to if you dont want to
But dont say I didnt warn ya
Oh and I dont need no hook for this shiiiit

Sweeeet and still theres pain pain pain pain
If I would have grew up to be a doctor
My nephews would have grew up to do the same same same
But since I grew up through the game
And my influence is the same
And my therapy is music
They ask if you ashamed ashamed
And though I wish I could separate the two things
I cannot so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes
No shame no sir
Just big boats Im tearing the coast up
Tight coupes like Im wearing the roadster
For any coupe bearhugging the holster

Yall hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin shit
Yall question whether he fallin off
Ima really confuse yall on this one follow

Verse 1 JayZ
When them tops come down chicks tops come down
Like when them shots come out make cops come around
When them blocks come out I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear then the bitch come out
Thats him Im usually what they whisper bout
Either what chick he with or his chip amount
Cause I been doin this since CHiPs was out
Watchin Erik Estrada
Baggin up at the Ramada table full of powder
AC broke bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere game or the fight
You might see me anywhere a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
Im so bossy bitch get off me
Trick get off me you cant get shit off me
Im so flossy no 6s on Sprees

Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it dont front

Verse 2 JayZ
Theyre all actors lookin at themselves in the mirror backwards
Cant even face themselves dont fear no rappers
Theyre all weirdos De Niros in practice
So dont believe everything your earlobe captures
Its mostly backwards unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song you happen to see
Then actually believe half of what you see
None of what you hear even if its spat by me
And with that said I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short give you wheels for legs
Im a KIdoubleLER see yall in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER whoa
This aint BR no its SC CEO
The next Lyor no the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing Ima do is free Sigel go

Verse 3 Beanie Sigel
Uhh take off the cuffs unlock the gate
Its that ignorant nigga that you love to hate

Keep my flea collar on you lil ticks get off me

Verse 4 JayZ

Verse 1 JayZ
I used to give a fuck now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success It sucks too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie but Im not and my nuts big
I dont know what the fuss is my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable Im not to be fucked with with
Shit let that bitch breathe
Im way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portions like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight Ill off your onswitch
Youre not too bright goodnight long kiss
Bye bye my reply BLAH BLAH
Blast burner then pass burner to TyTy
Finish my breakfast why
I got an appetite for destruction and youre a small fry
Now where was I
Let that bitch breathe
I used to give a shit now I dont give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was pisspoor
Im pissed off and is this what success is all about
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress all I got is this big house
Couple of cars I dont bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean I like the taste couldve saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr Chows Taos Nobu
Hold up let me move my bowels
Ill shit on yall niggas OG tell these boys
Yall aint got shit on my nigga aoww
I got watches I aint seen in months
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once

To receives great but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Aint gotta brag about the Feds young man
Old cribs I sold yall drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like thats whats in

When I get to one brick then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like
Sorry God I lied but give me one more try try
Got to two bricks new cars new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess its two sides to what substance abuse is
Cant stop wont stop addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles Im so ruthless
Front row fight night see how big my tube is
Fuck HD nigga see how clear my view is
But theres a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big will put you on the map
Stickup kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn

Chorus Bilal JayZ
I know I shouldve did that
I know its gon come right back
I know its gon destroy everything I made
Its probably gon get ya boy sent away
But this game I play aint no way to fix it
Its inevitable now ya fallin

Verse 2 JayZ
When you shouldve fell back
Now you fallin right into they lap
Fallin they applauding they screaming at the screen
Damn you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather Goodfellas Scarface Casino
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat
Cant beat the odds cant cheat the Gods
Cant blow too hard lifes a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling youre falling youre mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming fallin
Now lets pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
Cause come January it gets cold when the letters start to slow
And your commissarys low and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn gravitys ill

Chorus Bilal JayZ
I know I shouldve did that
I know its gon come right back
I know its gon destroy everything I made
Its probably gon get ya boy sent away
But this game I play aint no way to fix it
Its inevitable but ya fallin

Verse 3 JayZ
And you cant get up
All you do is pushup pullup situp
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they wont make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on em
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming hard to keep something on your stomach
Youre sick about what your life is becoming fallin
But your usetos hasbeens ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube bout what you used to do
But thats old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
Theyre the new you and its damn near inevitable
Theyll experience dja vu too
Fight and youll never survive
Run and youll never escape so just fall from grace
Damn

Chorus Bilal
I know I shouldve did that
I know its gon come right back
I know its gon destroy everything I made
Its probably gon get ya boy sent away
But this game I play aint no way to fix it
Its inevitable that Im

Outro Bilal

Fallin seems like Im fallin
Fallin seems like Im fallin

Fallin seems like Im fallin
Fallin seems like Im fallin

Momma was a mink wearer papa ran numbers
So its plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream Im living the life still
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still Im grinding army jacket lining
40 below Timbs on getting my Ms on
My best friends gone
I seen bad days still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J Blige Reminisce on
I hear his voice in my mind like nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info puffing on EndoNesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up that right Im high nigga

If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house

In Ibiza I had pizza in the club
Ladies know Im that guy they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Billie Jean the goddamn boy aint mine
And the Roc break up had the people losing hope
Cant lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Now Im back in the go mode back in the gogos
Throwing the diamond up repping the logo
Rose gold Ros flow Im okay though
What dont kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and Im not Domino
When it all falls down Im like Kanyes jaw
I might break but I dont fold til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah thats my goal

Prodigal Child yall not ready for the future ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle

Intro
The other night when I was researching what was going to be discussed today I came across a passage wrote down I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was just talking about and I learned that all things must come to an end it is an inevitable part of the cycle of existance all things must conclude
Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn among the steel and the concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves one day it too will pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand as a monument to the one that came before

Intro Gloria Carter
Shawn Carter was born December 4th weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces He was the last of my four children The only one who didnt give me any pain when I gave birth to him And thats how I knew that he was a special child

Verse 1 JayZ
They say They never really miss you til you dead or you gone
So on that note Im leavin after the song
So you aint gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why Im this way hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds when I was born I didnt give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasnt purpose I aint perfect I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasnt matchin my gear
Now Im just scratchin the surface
Cause whats buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school got good grades could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted

Interlude Gloria Carter
Shawn was a very shy child growing up He was into sports and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike A twowheeler at that isnt that special But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up

Verse 2 JayZ
Now all the teachers couldnt reach me
And my momma couldnt beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein me
So with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to caine Im a hustler now
My gear is in and Im in the incrowd
And all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin me now
My selfesteem went through the roof man I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wackass
Im gettin ahead of myself by the way I could rap
But that came second to me movin this crack
Gimme a second I swear I would say about my rap career
Til 96 came niggas Im here goodbye

Interlude Gloria Carter
Shawn used to be in the kitchen beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning And then I bought him a boom box and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble

Verse 3 JayZ
Goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot knowin cops could rush
And you in a drop youre so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth pretty much
And trust is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers we dont sleep we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst til you die yup
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got em
And this was the stress I lived with
Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin I pray Im forgiven
For every bad decision I made every sister I played
Cause Im still paranoid to this day
And its nobodys fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose or rather the life that chose me

Outro JayZ
If you cant respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe youll love me when I fade to black
If you cant respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe youll love me when I fade to black
Now if you cant respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe youll love me when I fade to black
If you cant respect that your whole perspective is wack
Maybe youll love me when I fade

Turn the music up turn me down
Guru lets go get em again
This time its for the money my nigga
Brooklyn stand up

Verse 1 JayZ
Theres never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop this hot or this strong
With so many different flows this ones for this song
The next one I switch up this one will get bit up
These fucks too lazy to make up shit they crazy
They dont paint pictures they just trace me
You know what Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
Im like TAA
Im not a biter Im a writer for myself and others
I say a BIG verse Im only bigging up my brother
Bigging up my borough Im big enough to do it
Im that thorough plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about bring em out
Its hard to yell when the barrels in your mouth
Im in new sneakers dualseaters few divas
What more can I tell you Let me spell it for you
WI doubleL IE nobody truer than HOV
And Im back for more New Yorks ambassador
Prime Minister back to finish my business up

Chorus HumV
What more can I say

I know this much is true true true
My love

Interlude JayZ
What more can I say to you You heard it all

Verse 2 JayZ
You already know what Im about flying birds down South
Moving wet off the step purple rain in a drought
Stunting on hoes brushing off my shirt
But aint nothing on my clothes except my chain my name
Young HO pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol I make payroll
Benz paid for friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris caseloads I dont give a shit
Nigga one life to live I cant let a day go
By without me being fly fresh to death
Head to toe till the day I rest
And I dont wear jerseys Im 30plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga buttonups
S Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say Guru play the beat

Break JayZ HumV
My nigga hahahaha woo
We gon let this ride into the hook
 Ima snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you
 Get my grown man on
LETS GO
What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy

Verse 3 JayZ
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass aint lilyWhite
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly Its both
I dont mean to boast but damn if I dont brag
Them crackers gon act like I aint on they ass
The Martha Stewart thats far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student just had the balls to do it
And no Im not through with it
In fact Im just previewing it
This aint the show Im just EQing it
Onetwo and I wont stop abusing it
To groupie girls stop false accusing it
Back to the music  the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem Houston
What up B they cant shut up me
Shut down I not even PE Imma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me letting these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TiTi in the forehead
Tell her Please forgive me then squeeze into your forehead
Im not the one to score points off in fact
I got a joint thatll knock your points off
Young Hova the God nigga blast for me
Im at the Trump International ask for me
I aint never scared Im everywhere you aint never there
And nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound Im the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
A CEOs mind that marketing plan was me
And no I aint get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I aint animated like say a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
Im supposed to be number one on everybody list
Well see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man

Chorus
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Yall cant fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close youll hear what Im about
Nigga feel my truths

Verse 1
Pop died didnt cry didnt know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church pretending to be hurt wouldnt work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like Damn that mans face is just like my face
So pop I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasnt all your fault homie you got caught
Into the same game I fought that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
Im just glad we got to see each other
Talk and remeet each other
Save a place in Heaven til the next time we meet forever

Chorus
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty

Verse 2
Music business hate me cause the industry aint make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it yet they all yell holla
If skills sold truth be told Id probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill  I aint been rhyming like Common since
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception Go with what makes sense
Since I know what Im up against
We as rappers must decide whats most important
And I cant help the poor if Im one of them
So I got rich and gave back to me thats the winwin
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them rims that is

Chorus
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close youll hear what Im about
Nigga feel my truths

Verse 3
My homie Sig was on a tier where no tears should fall
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
Til we all got triangles on our wall
Aint just rapping for the platinum yall record
I recall cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago prepared the flow
Prepared for war I should fear no man
You dont hear me though these words aint just pared to go
In one ear out the other ear no
Yo my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me nigga Scars will scab
What you gonna box me homie I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldnt touch me thank God for that
Im strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK nigga holla back

Chorus
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard Son do you know why Im stopping you for
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are
I aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
Arent you sharp as a tack

Verse 3
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin a pussy
But a pussy havin no goddamn sense try and push me
I try to ignore him talk to the Lord
Pray for him but some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing thats gon happen is Ima get to clappin
And he and his boys gonna be yappin to the Captain
And there I go trapped in the KitKat again
Back through the system with the riffraff again
Fiends on the floor scratchin again
Paparazzis with they cameras snappin em
DA try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil for bail cause Im African
All because this fool was harassin them
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccharine
But aint nothin sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein a bitch aint one  hit me

Hook

Just Blaze
Fellow Americans it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

Verse 1 JayZ
Allow me to reintroduce myself
My name is Hov OH HtotheOV
I used to move snowflakes by the OZ
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the ROC Hov
Fresh out the fryin pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin my chain thats right
Hov OHnot DOC
But similar to them letters No One Can Do it Better
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strict told me Dude finish your breakfast
So thats what Ima do take you back to the dude
With the Lexus fastforward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors laughing
This aint a movie dog oh shit

Interlude Just Blaze
Now before I finish let me just say I did not come here to show out did not come here to impress you Because to tell you the truth when I leave here Im GONE
And I dont care WHAT you think about mebut just remember when it hits the fan brother whether its next year ten years twenty years from now youll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK

Verse 2 JayZ
Thing aint lie
I done came through the block in everything thats fly
Im like Che Guevara with bling on Im complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get my by any means on whenever theres a drought
Get your umbrellas out because thats when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn but I aint invent the game
I just rolled the dice trying to get some change
And Id do it twice aint no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There aint no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you dont think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then how would you explain
Im ten years removed still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit nigga period
Check out my hat yo peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag yo I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go you are what you are player
And you can try to change but thats just the top layer
Man you was who you was fore you got here
Only God can judge me so Im gone
Either love me or leave me alone

Uhh this feel right right here Quik
Its like its supposed to happen this one right here
Young God damn
Let me justify my thug on this one right here

Verse 1 JayZ
It goes one oclock two oclock three oclock Roc
Five six seven oclock eight oclock Roc
Eleven oclock twelve oclock the party bout to pop
Then RocAFella yall Its your boy S Dot
And I aint never been to jail I aint never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
I aint never ran never will
I aint never been smacked a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for whats under that mans belt
I never asked for nothin I dont demand of myself
Honesty loyalty friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasnt felt which is why I aint never played myself
I just play the hand Im dealt I cant say Ive never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself
If you dont give me heaven Ill raise hell
Til its heaven

Chorus Sharlotte Gibson
Justify my thug for you
My thug hoping
My thug praying for you
To justify my thug
My thug hoping
My thug praying for you
For you

Verse 2 JayZ
Now if you shoot my dog Imma kill yo cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap know dat
For every action theres a reaction dont have me relapsin
Relaxins what Im about but about mine
Dont be actin like you cant see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my minds on the finish line facin the wreck
I put my muhfuckin faith in the tec tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin my breath
I am narrowly escapin my death oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin Mach 5 barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I cant let them deliver me to you
Until I won this race then eventually
My engine gon burn out I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine red line

Chorus Sharlotte Gibson
Justify my thug for you
My thug hoping
My thug praying for you
To justify my thug
My thug hoping
My thug praying for you
For you

Verse 3 JayZ
They say an eye for an eye we both lose our sight
And two wrongs dont make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that its just one life
At what point does one fight Good question right
Fore you knock the war try to put your dogs in his
Tenandahalfs for a minuteandahalf
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win aint in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block niggas standin tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin to cop a shop  call theyself cleansin in the cash
But cant put they name on paper cause then you on blast
Mr President theres drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do come break bread with us
Mr Governor I swear theres a cover up
Every other corner theres a liquor store fuck is up

Chorus Sharlotte Gibson
Justify my thug for you

My thug praying for you
To justify my thug

So you need to change your attitude fore they asking what happened to you

Verse 1
Lord forgive him he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Themamurder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performing procedures
Jesus I aint trying to be facetious but
Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord you said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping Brown Sugar by DAngelo
In Los Angeles like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe being good Catholics Im coming

Hook
Lucifer son of the morning Im gonna chase you out of Earth

Verse 2
Yes this is holy war I wet yall all with the holy water
Spray from the HecklerKoch automatic
All the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw couple at you take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis to a head above
Yessir and when I perish the meek shall inherit the Earth
til that time its on and popping church
Like Don Bishop the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebodys cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk the more you irking us
The more you gon need memorial services
The Black Album second verse is like
Devils pie save some dessert for us

Interlude
Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They wont be happy til somebody die
Oh man I gotta get my soul right
Fore Im locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems its alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
Let me get serious for yall one second

Verse 3
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bobs killer
Asking him why as my eyes fill up
These days I cant wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten homes I still feel ya
So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are Bobalob
Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bobs a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning thanks again

Intro Pharrell JAYZ
Young Its the life
Once again its the life yes
I dont know why I get so high oh
Its intoxicatin man yall dont know why you do what you do
Get so high oh get so high high off the life

Verse 1 JAYZ
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
Ive got a thing for the bigbody Benzes it dulls my senses
In love with a VDub engine
Man Im high off life fuck it Im wasted
Bathing Ape kicks Audemars Piguet wrist
My womenfriends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice get their Winters replaced with
The sunit aint even fun no more Im jaded
Man its just a game I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so naturally
Up next was me but what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends still I play
The starring role in Hovitos Way

Chorus JAYZ Pharrell
Its just life I solemnly swear
To change my approach stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes put down the toast
Cause I be doing the most OH NO
But every time I felt That was that it called me right back
It called me right back
Man it called me right back OH NO

Verse 2 JAYZ
Im like a Russian mobster drinking distilled vodka
Until Im under the field with Hoffa its real
Peel the top up like a toupemix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up make a souffl
All of yall can get it like grouppage on your 2way
Im living proof that crime do pay
Say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
Putting cars in their name for the stars of the game
Putting caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train
All in the Name of Love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes
We all hustlers in love with the same thing

Chorus JAYZ Pharrell
Its just life I solemnly swear
To change my approach stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes put down the toast
Cause I be doing the most OH NO
But every time I felt That was that it called me right back
It called me right back
Man it called me right back OH NO

Verse 3 JAYZ
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Kleins green 5 until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need 
What the game did to my pulse  with no results
And you can treat your nose and still wont come close
The game is a lightbulb with eleventymillion volts
And Im just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I cant explain why I just love to get high
Drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
Im in the blueberry 5 you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldnt escape the allure
Dying young leaving a goodlookin corpse of course

Chorus JAYZ Pharrell
Its just life I solemnly swear
To change my approach stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes put down the toast
Cause I be doing the most OH NO
But every time I felt That was that it called me right back
It called me right back
Man it called me right back OH NO

Outro JAYZ Pharrell
Once again its the life
Yeah I said its the life
Once I again its the life
OH NO I dont know why I
Get so high oh
Get so high oh
Get so high high off the life

Produced by Aqua and 3H

Intro Notorious BIG in a 1996 MTV interview
Gotta try to stay above water yknow
Just stay busy stay working
Puff told me like the key to this joint
The key to staying on top of things
Is treat everything like its your first project nomsayin
Like its your first day like back when you was an intern
Like thats how you try to treat things like just stay hungry

Verse 1 JAYZ
Yall wanna know why he dont stop
Yall wanna know why he dont flop
Let me tell you pepeople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born it was sworn I was never gon be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my riide on
Eyes on the prize Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit  thats how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some Just Me Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon learn
Had to lay way in the cut til I finally got my turn
Now Im on top in the spot that I earned

Chorus JAYZ
Its my life its my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
Its my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me its my everything

Verse 2 JAYZ
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like its 92 again and I got Os in the rental
Back in the Stu again
No prob livin was a whole lot simple
When you think back you thought that
You would never make it this far
Then you take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Aint no half steppin aint no no slippin
Aint no different from a block thats hittin
Gotta get it while the gettings good
Gotta strike while the irons hot before you stop
Then you gotta bid it good riddance
Goodbye This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hooptie a cookpot and the GAME
This ones with the stu with the stage with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune but certainly the FAME

Chorus JAYZ
Its my life its my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
Its my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me its my everything
Treat my first like my last and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

It was all a dream

Refrain Faith Evans
Last night I had a dream thoughts was racin through my head
Felt so real to me this is what was said

Verse 1 JayZ
Had a dream I said Bout who he said
Bout BIG I said Thats big he said
Dig what he said Proceed he said
Indeed I said so breathe I did
Dont repeat what I say I said he said nothing
He agreed with his head he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a whisper last evening I said
Whats the deal playboy was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know whats the reason he was dead
Mo Money Mo Problems better believe it he said
Careful what you wish for you might receive it he said
I see I said jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then BI said Hov remind yourself
Nobody built like you you designed yourself
I agree I said my one of a kind self
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said I said has been said before
Just keep doin your thing he said say no more

Refrain Faith Evans
Was it all a dream  tell me
Was it all a dream was it a dream
Was it all a dreeeeeeeeeeeeam
I gotta know It was all a dream
Was it all a dream  was it a dream
Was it all a dream a dream
Was it all a dreeeeeeeeeeeeam

Verse 2 Notorious BIG
It was all a dream I used to read Word Up magazine
SaltnPepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr Magic Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo sipping on private stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke duhha duhha
You never thought that hiphop would take it this far
Now Im in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G Brucey B Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex Lovebug Starsky
Im blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib same number same hood its all good
And if you dont know now you know nigga

Refrain Faith Evans
Was it all a dream  tell me
Was it all a dream was it a dream
Was it all a dreeeeeeeeeeeeam
I gotta know It was all a dream
Was it all a dream  was it a dream
Was it all a dream a dream
Was it all a dreeeeeeeeeeeeam

Outro JayZ spoken
I see I said jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said

They say a midget standin on the giants shoulder can see much
Further than the giant the giant
So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see
Further than I am than I am
And I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath Goliath
But sooner or later that patience gonna run its course
And Im forced to be a tyrant be a tyrant
But me and Tyran comin through your environment
Iron mask nigga iron gats nigga I am back
With The Team no I in that
ROC yall not eyein that
Yall dont see clearly cause the rain aint gone
The Dynasty no not Ming but Shawns
Dame Kareem nigga its the gangsta team
Stop your run one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason we got a gang of green
If theres better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen nigga

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Jeah jeah

Chorus
Cant touch the untouchable break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable its Hovi baby
Cant see the unseeable reach the unreachable
Do the impossible its Hovi baby
Cant move the unmoveable stop the unstoppable

JayZ
Jeah look
Im so far ahead of my time Im bout to start another life
Look behind you Im bout to pass you twice
Back to the future gotta slow up for the present
Im fast niggas cant get past my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present
When I unwrap The Gift  The Curse in one session
Aint no livin person can test him
Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight Summers critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before you get it I had it
Got mad at it and dont want it no more
And that goes for everything from flippin that raw
Flippin whores flippin vocal chords dont get it twisted
Get it right did different did it better did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice get it right

Chorus
Cant touch the untouchable break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable its Hovi baby
Cant see the unseeable reach the unreachable
Do the impossible its Hovi baby

JayZ
Yup Hovis home the global phone
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back
You cats overfelt yourself
You couldnt help yourself now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get absentminded
Now its time to rewind and remind em
Why Im in the position that I am
Changin the game my game could nail Madonna
Well after Im gone theyll honor
History in the makin Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin without missin the beat
Chasin the hihat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here BOOM
And plus I get paper dog dont let me forget
The watch face so blue like its holdin its breath
Cant see me skill for skill or check for check
Its the bowtie flow dog I bring it to your neck
Live and direct I will bring it to your set
I got now I dont care who got next
Rapper slash Exec Kordell Stewart
Your flow all yall using is mine youre all useless
You aint a factor who are you foolin
You all are faggots you takin it backwards takin it backwards
Im tryin to progress with this rap shit
Nigga nigga your whole career is a accident
Who was gassin em Fuck outta here

Chorus
Cant touch the untouchable break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable its Hovi baby
Cant see the unseeable reach the unreachable
Do the impossible its Hovi baby

The Watcher
What should I do for a living nigga
What should I eat for a living nigga
What should I live for a living nigga

Verse 1 JayZ
Things just aint the same for gangstas
But Im a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claimin they bangers
Doin all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers
Disrespectin the game no home training or manners
I was doin this shit when you was shittin your Pampers
I was movin them grams fore you knew what a handtohand was
Duckin the vans radars the scanners
Before you knew what hard white or tan was
I was hittin the turnpike aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands cuz aight with them hammers
I was prickin my finger before you knew what a fam was
I had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
300 mil later now you understand us
Yall aint see us comin through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was puttin Peter Pan up in your room
Yall fuckin with whom Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learnin the shit that we taught
You niggas aint know about a Robb Report
About a high speed Porsche
Ie you niggas aint know how to floss
Til I came through the door
Like Eric B for Pres respect me in this bitch
You cant disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was suckin em so long fuckin your little neck up
Now you too big for your britches
You got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner you just ridiculous
I blew breath for you midgets I gave life to the game
Its only right I got the right to be king
Niggas that got life really like what I sing
Cause they know what its really like niggas feel my pain
Know the shit I dont write be the illest shit thats ever been recited in the game
Word to the hyphen in my name JAY Dash Hoffa
The past present nigga the future proper
The holy trinity of hiphop is us
We give Dre his props but thats where it stops its the Roc

Hook Truth Hurts Terri
I know you got your eyes on me I feel you watching me
But it aint hard to see that you cant see me
You try but what you think you saw
Aint what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go aint the same as before
People I used to know just dont know me no more
But everywhere that I go I got people I know
Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low

Verse 2 Dr Dre
Im still on top of the game
Still droppin flames still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks theres been a lot since I came
You seen it all how I got how I gained
The momentum when it dropped how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock they watched me reclaim
The streets they made a special spot for my name
Dre haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs itll drive them insane
The odds that I played
The best to emerge in the game its the Watcher

Hook Truth Hurts
I know you got your eyes on me I feel you watching me
But it aint hard to see that you cant see me
You try but what you think you saw
Aint what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
Everywhere that I go aint the same as before
People I used to know just dont know me no more
But everywhere that I go I got people I know
Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low

Verse 3 Rakim
Im Rated R my brain contains graphics thangs
It turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
Its like watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic the object A fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it
But those that havent got it take away to add a profit
Its catastrophic I take the gat and cock it
And Ill sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly I keep it gully
The world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
Yo my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try copin
Ive seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
Im still alive and scopin
Be another hundred years til my skies close in
And Ima die with my eyes open the Watcher

Hook Truth Hurts Terri
I know you got your eyes on me I feel you watching me
But it aint hard to see that you cant see me
You try but what you think you saw

Only time we dont speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the shows over
Shes right back to being my soldier
Cause mamis a rider and Im a roller
Put us together how they gon stop both us
Whatever she lacks Im right over her shoulder
When Im off track mami is keepin me focused

Buy whats on the wall go ahead and treat yoself
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
To the lot and lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a closet full of ammunition and funds
Mink RocaWear and some guns Pelle and a fresh pair of Jordans
Dro packs and Bo Jacks and Air Maxes throwbacks and 1s

Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense Ill put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking a hustle married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordans and Starter jackets

I carry guns heavy speak easy slight with the fight words

Drop top rago with the weed gone
Chillin bags in the trunk full of FAO Schwartz for the chilluns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens lick a few kittens just kiddin

Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin mad cause the money done

Rumor has it The Blueprint classic

Everybody dupin the flow you see em
Everybody loopin up soul
Its like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kanyeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin glancin every chance they get
Like  oh shit hes so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years no ransom
Cant one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hovs goin to Canton Im now eligible

Verse 2 JayZ
For those that think Hov fingers bling blingn
Either havent heard the album or they dont know English
They only know what the single is and single that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And bein Im about my business not minglin much
Runnin my mouth that shit kept lingerin
But no dummy thats the shit Im sprinklin
The album width to keep the registers ringin
In real life Im much more distinguished
Im like a bloke from London England
Jeah you jinglin baby
See I go right back and I bring em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot but never lost my soul
Crossed the line I bought pop across the row

Singing Paul Anka  JayZ
Now the end is near Can you believe this shit Guru
So I face Im from the hood man the final curtain
No the REAL hood the hood not the RAP hood
The REAL hood like three pair of pants
My friends Ill say it clear pair of sneakers
My moms is bustin her ass State my case
Nigga Im going to Japan tomorrow Which Im certain
You understand what Im saying Can you believe that
I lived a life thats full They have people waiting
at the airport like five days like Im a Beatle or something
Thats really something And I traveled each and every highway
Seen the best of the best the worst of the worst and more
Much more than this still here I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
Lets try this one
Uhh yeah

Verse 1 JayZ
Gangsta nigga
Put my hustle down tore the game up nigga
Took your high score down put my name up nigga
Tore the doors down to the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way and more much more than this
Thats right its a beautiful thing man

I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy I did it my way  Hovi baby

Verse 2 JayZ
Mommas youngest and strongest survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurtin assertive flirted with death
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Grandmas favorite she could not understand
How theres people in the world who wouldnt want me as a neighbor
Has to explain to her you think these folks want me in the penthouse
As a reminder that I make top paper
Black entrepreneur nobody did us no favors
Nobody gave us shit we made us
The Rap Pack Im Sinatra Dames Sam Davis
Biggs the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
We came in this game not beggin niggas pardon
Demandin yall respect hand over a check
And while yall at it hand over the jet
We the reason they aint hand over Def Jam so quick
They knew every year I was droppin new product
I was raisin the stock up while buildin the Roc up
But thats alright cause they knew they had to see us
When it was time for us to reup make us multimillionires
Jejejeah

And more much more than this I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy

Verse 3 JayZ
Jeah In My Lifetime
I caught smaller cases but I had capital
Hypocritic system let me right back at you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you specially if you black dude
They dont give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin him as bad news
Cause in my past I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga Un yo I scratched him he went home without an aspirin
But its cool cause we back friends it happened and its over
Its in the past and Im glad now Im back to bein Hova
Maybach with the chaffeur laid back
Helicopter seat feet inclined shit feelin like a sofa
Helicopter meet me Teterboro take me over
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now its back to speakin to vultures
So the next time that page six approaches us
Heres a quote from Jay nigga I did it my  way

And more much more than this I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy

JayZ

You put on two tube socks you couldnt walk in my shoes
I was dealt a bad hand fuck what else could I do
But keep somethin up my sleeve thatll help me through
But can you believe everywhere Im at models come through
Catfightin catwalkin it happens often
Its true how society dont want me to move
Into the penthouse building with spectacular views
Theyre like uhh Hes a menace he could never be a tenant
Im like ooh whats a young nigga to do
I bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that I dont
Give a fuck we just chillin watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
Old lady dont blow my high
specially if you dont know my life dont make me bring
Sharpton in it cause Im darkskinneded or
Dude with the fro and the Rainbow Coalition Imma
Victim of a single parent household born in a mousehole
Mousetrap niggas wanna know
How so how Jay get up out that here yeah
I snatched purses I persevered yeah
I had work fiends purchased it was clear
I was out there sellin hope for despair but stop there
I swear I only make good from my mouth to Gods ears

But I was born in the city where the skinny niggas die
Born in the city where the skinny niggas ride
And as a skinny nigga I had beef with high size

Come on
Ha hey yo stop playin man
This is real serious
Ha Its the rock yeah yo

Verse 1 JayZ
Lets go
Post Positano Hov hangin with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you too can cool out poolside at the Delano
If you too flow like you was out of your mind yo
Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonalds
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now heres something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills good luck could happen
Lets go

Cmon Its the Roc repeat 4X
Thats right

Verse 2 JayZ
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it crisscrossed aint no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual hes criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips Im earning my bachelors
By dating all the models and actresses
Im learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rappin and whatevers happening
Rocawear Im the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my home nigga Im gone cmon

Cmon Its the Roc 3X
Cmon Thats right Cmon


Hook Lenny Kravitz repeat 2X
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life Guns and Roses

Verse 3 JayZ
Tote more Guns than Roses foes is
Visibly shook of the invisible bully lets go
Flowers need water to grow it gotta rain
In order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born somebodys slain
You know the saying somebodys lose is anothers gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You aint even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
Youll get return in your investment if attention you pay lets go

Cmon Its the Roc 3X
Cmon Thats right Cmon

Fuck your G up have ya with blue Pampers in a coma
And your family now moan look seventy pounds gone

To get over we prowl with slippery shell tactics
Chippety frail bastards your tracks need tuneups
Lil nigglet what the fuck you recordin for Nick Jr

Rock with my cock out face the crowd and piss off stage

Razor blades under the tongue I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction I am starving today
Got a money hungry lawyer thatll eat the case

Woo
Uhh uhh
Its The Gift and the Curse
Uhh uhh yeah
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again
They love me again
Lets take a trip down
I gotcha

Verse
Lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain grey skies seems at the end of every
Young black life is this line Damn him already
Such a good kid got us pourin Henn already
Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
When it cracks through the pavement thats my way of sendin love
So give Big a hug tell Aaliyah I said hi
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us damn
Poor Isis thats his mama name
Mama aint strong enough to raise no boy whats his father name
Shorty never knew him though he had his blood in him
Hot temper mama said he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with him so the streets raised him
Isis blamin herself she wish she couldve saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him can save him
He put his faith in a thirtyeight in his waist
But when you live by the gun you die by the same fate
End up dead before thirtyeight and umm
Thats the life of us raised by winter its a cold world
Old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
Isis life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed
Down at the City Morgue opened the drawer saw him nude
Her addiction grew prescription drugs sippin brew
Angel dust dipped in WOO
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had herself pregnant by a different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasnt really her husband though he called her wife
It was just this night when moon was full
And the stars were just right and the dress was real tight
Had her soundin like Lisa Lisa I wonder if I take you home
Will you still love me after this night
Mike was the hardhead from around the way
That she wanted all her life shit she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life he wasnt really the one to like
It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isis liked this Broadway life
She loved the Gucci sneakers the red green and whites
Hangin out the window when she first seen him fight
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight that
Turned into a homicide thatll alter their life
See Mike at thirtytwo was still on the scene
Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant but he disowned him like
If that was my son he would look much different
See Im lightskinned and that baby theres dark
So its mamas baby papas maybe
Mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets fuck niggas want
Had his old reliable thirtyeight gun in his reach
Its been fourteen years him and Isis aint speak
He runnin around like lifes a peach til one day
He approached this thug that had a mean mug
And it looked so familiar that he called him Young Cuz
Told him get off the strip but the boy aint budge fuck you
Instead he pulled out a newer thirtyeight snub
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused hold up
There was somethin in this mans face he knew he seen before
Its like lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature
And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
Whats that He who hesitates is lost
He cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didnt think he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father youre killin your son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father you killin your sons

To old Nell Sigel street I aint forget you
Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck
Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up
Moms smoke kids cant chase the ice cream truck
Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up
Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up
Remember Lil Eddie man how he light mean up
Then they wonder why we light green up
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I cant I lean up
Aint the L or the refer that steam up
Its my head stress to the point I get a fever
Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids
That cant leave and how the Chinks gotta feedem
For the rest of their life
Fucking wings fried vegetable ricegotta be kidding
No breakfast Capn Crunch at night
Our kids eating lunch at night
In their beds all bunched in tight
No less than three or four you know how it go
Two by the foot two by the headboard
Man Im getting scared for them Yeah I know
Thats how I feel for them
And we gotta grip of shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties

We know tomorrow aint a promise so we get that there
Fuck sitting in the living room guarding the steps
Working inside a slum house starving to death
Serving these nigga flippers quarterounces and zippers
Agents snapping your picture
Neighbors plotting to get ya
Situations is critic
I was out here to get it
Living it like a savage cause nigga I gotta have it
And holding back on the motherfuck Im in it for the haul dog

Raw rough and rugged when addressing the mass public
My attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
Got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck being famous I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter my success in this game
Is sort of like Projectic Justice
A payment for brushes with police officers
A peace offering from the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Til Im deceased in a coffin
Ima be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
Please your disdain for the brothers aint gon change the numbers
Its the strengthening of chain among us
Please we aint afraid of none of yas who want it with us
Aint nuttin changed since the ninetysix summer cmon

Some people hating Yeah

Verse 2
I guess its just the penalty of leadership
I guess Im what niggas wanna be and shit
Or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
Before they get to rappin start believing it think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave move my feet from side to side
Im back stronger than ever surprise surprise
They try to take me out the game but Is alive
Its like a old Negro spiritual but I mastered Toby
With a splash of Monster Kody shoot faster than Kobe nigga
You bastards know me the one and only
Big homey from the Roc I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life its either that
Or yall gon make me put the double Desert Eagles in ya life nigga

Hook JayZ  Sample

Some people hating Jealousy is a weak emotion man
You gotta overcome that come on man be stronger than that
Some people kill their brothers You know what I think
I think they lost their minds Youll be alright though

Verse 3
Au contraire nigga I am here cause I earned this shit
By riding out when niggas had learners permit
We bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out bring your buggy eyes out
Turn your six I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback I know you bitch niggas from way back
Niggas wanna clown but the pound it dont play dat
Get yourself found drowned where the lake at
Run up on em notoriously take that take that
And then we coming where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats you can hate that

Cant take back what I took back to the Brook look

Verse 2
Cant yall see that hes fake the rap version of TD Jakes
Prophesizin on your CDs and tapes
Wont break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith
I put dollars on mine ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped I was the first in line
Donatin proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road thats how you judge Hov no
Aint I supposed to be absorbed in myself
Every time theres a tragedy Im the first one to help
They call me this misogynist but they dont call me the dude
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics depositin checks
They put in they pocket all you get in return is a lot of lip
And yall buy the shit caught up in the hype
Cause the nigga wear a kufi it dont mean that he bright
Cause you dont understand him it dont mean that he nice
It just means you dont understand all the bullshit that he write
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice
Ive been real all my life they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose for even in defeat
Theres a valuable lesson learned so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though
Savin me the hassle of speakin to half of these assholes
And Ima let karma catch up to JazO whoa
Im back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama cant save you this time niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me
Yet so religiously thats why they call me Hov
I get the spoils cause the victor is me Me nigga
Youre an actor youre not who youre depicted to be
You street dreamin all yall niggas livin through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin you emcee
Im a legend you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence

This heres a ballad for all the fallen soldiers
Imma bout ta show you how a hustlers life
this is life man and a soldiers life parallel
And the one thing they got in common is a mothers pain

Picture split screen
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block human beings
Other side you got the soldier getting ready for boot camp soldiers
Theyre both at war this is life
Stay with us

Hook Marc Dorsey
Did you ever notice before you think life goes fast
So dont you worry about what you see it will pass

Verse 1
You lost him mama the wars callin him
Feel its his duty to fall in line with all of them
Hes a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank like hes supposed ta
Now just remember why hes gone til November
Its part of him growing up
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beatin so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah I know it sucks Life aint all rosebuds
A couple of speed bumps you gotta take your lumps
Off to boot camp the worlds facing terror
Bin Laden been happenin in Manhattan
Crack was anthrax back then back when
Police was AlQaeda to black men
While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion
He was off to war killing for a living

Hook

Verse 2
Days turn to nights nights turn to years
Years turn to How the fuck we make it in here
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole wont see the light of day
And I feel like Im just writing my life away
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
Theres a war going on outside no man is safe from
Im here for the good fight only the fakes run
Im here for the purple heart if I cant take one
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living
I love my niggas more than anything else
This wars about my family me needin the wealth
You dont understand how useless as men we felt
Till you become a 5 star general
Shout out to my niggas thats locked in jail
POWs thats still in the war for real

Hook

Verse 3
Mama said pray your sons becoming a man
This wars taxin to em like Uncle Sam
He aint gon always make the right choice understand
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
Its death before dishonor
And if hes gone you should honor his memory
Dont cry we all gonna die eventually
But if hes locked in the penitentiary send him some energy

But youre here with me I appreciate that

Verse 1
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing em in the home of the Terrapins

Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed got rid of that dirt for them
Wasntbornhustlers I was birthing em
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome it aint easy
Cops want to knock me DA wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty he who does not feel me
Is not real to me therefore he doesnt exist
So poof Vamoose son of a bitch

Hook
H to the izzO V to the izzA

Verse 2
I do this for my culture to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady it needs to be taken over

Im overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk but money talks so talk mo bucks

Hook

Verse 3
Hov is back life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs no Hov did that
So hopefully you wont have to go through that
I was raised in the projects roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin their mamas sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost why I got my hand closed
Cracks in my palm watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
Ive seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiends weight
To try and to fail the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game the two things thats great
H to the izzO V to the izzA
What else can I say about dude I gets busy

Hook

For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA

Intro
Turn my music high high high higher
You dont know what youre doing doing doing
Sure I do

Verse 1
Im from the streets where the hood could swallow em
And bulletsll follow em
And theres so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb this shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence
But its home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like its Wall Street holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham one slip you are now gone
Welcome to Hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return em
All scars we earn em
All cars we learn em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest I dont need Dapper Dan
This aint a sewn outfit holmes holmes is about it
Was clappin them flamers before I became famous
For playin me yall shall forever remain nameless

Interlude
I  am  Hov
You dont know what youre doing doing doing

Verse 2

Interlude
R  O  C

Verse 3
I came into this motherfucker a hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact from grindin Gpacks
Put this shit in motion aint no rewindin me back
Could make 40 off a brick but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told em that Hov would sell clothing
Not in this lifetime wasnt in my right mind
Thats another difference thats between me and them
I smarten up open the market up
One million two million three million four
In eighteen months eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin at one smart black boy
Momma aint raised no fool
Put me anywhere on Gods green earth Ill triple my worth

Interlude
Motherfucker I  will  not  lose
You dont know what youre doing doing doing
Put somethin on it

Verse 4
I sell ice in the winter I sell fire in hell
I am a hustler baby Ill sell water to a well

Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate never follow orders

Sounds like a love song
The most incredible baby
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Verse 1 Jay Z
Good dude I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
Its been months since I checked back in
Were somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain four and change Armor Alld down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I cant let you know it pride wont let me show it
Pretend to be heroic thats just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

Hook Jay Z
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes

I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

Verse 2 Jay Z
On repeat the CD of Bigs Me  My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin Let me see that clip
Shopping sprees pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
Thats when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine I dont know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick let me see  thats it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldnt touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they dont remember that and I dont remember you

Hook Jay Z
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah Ive seen em comin down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

Verse 3 Jay Z
A face of stone was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without gettin at me
Thats your fault how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me
I know the way a nigga livin was whack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Shit Im a man with pride you dont do shit like that
You dont just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You dont throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin them girls I was gon get right back
They say you cant turn a bad girl good
But once a good girls gone bad shes gone forever
Ill mourn forever
Shit Ive got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

Hook Jay Z
I cant see em comin down my eyes

VERIFIED COMMENTARY BY
Eminem 
    
Verse 1 JAYZ
Motherfuckers say that Im foolish I only talk about jewels Bling bling
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
See Im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin I made somethin doin
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist its just his ghetto point of view
The renegade you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies niggas crouched over
Mamis knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knockedNo hes not around
Now how that sound to ya Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin round
Hidin down duckin strays
From frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
I help them see they way through itnot you
Cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth youll lose your tie and your shirt

Verse 2 Eminem
Since Im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I aint no politician but Ill kick it with em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace
And if the shoe fits Ill wear it
But if it dont then yall will swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now whos the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But theres a huge interference
Theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
Maybe its hatred I spew maybe its food for the spirit
Maybe its beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But Im debated disputed hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin drug addict like you didnt experiment
Nah nahThats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin dogooders too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I dont think you do so stay tuned
And keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go hes JiggaJurJiggaJihJigga
And Im the sinister Mr KissMyAss is just a

Verse 3 JAYZ
I had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint not a cent
Gotta vent lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin Gotta pay rent bring dollars in
By the bodega iron under my coat
Feelin braver durag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
Do not step to me Im awkward I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me
And often my momma wasnt home
Could not stress to me I wasnt grown
Specially on nights I brought somethin home
To quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics
Raisin my head to the sky Big I did it multi before I die
No lie just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

Verse 4 Eminem
See Im a poet to some a regular modernday Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the king of these Latterday Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate satanist scatterbrained atheist
But that aint the case see its a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shadys as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See its as easy as cake simple as whistlin Dixie
While Im wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
Im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do Im just a kid from the gutter
Makin his butter off these bloodsuckers cause Im a muhfuckin

Verse
Uhh uhh uhh feel me now listen
Momma loved me pop left me
Mickey fed me Annie dressed me
Eric fought me made me tougher
Love you for that my nigga no matter what bruh
Marcy raised me and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in the song
Hootie babysitted changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me had me skipping school
Valencias boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Momma raised me pop I miss you
God help me forgive him I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly shit I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy I could do no wrong
Yeah its going past fast lets move along
Kitchen table thats where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down couldnt foresee
Clark sought me out Dame believed
Primo laced me Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt classic shoulda went triple
Momma loved me pop left me
Grandma dressed me plus she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffin on Ls drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga VA spot
Tone Mike Zo and them niggas VAs locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga whassup Hoff
BeeHigh hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew time to slow it down
October 21st Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Momma loved me TiTi Uncle Jay
Loves you to death wont let no trouble come your way
Oh cant forget my man down in Maryland
Hes gone til November how can I not remember
Tell your moms Im there for her and Tiembra
And your son too  theres nothing I wont do
Unless you was me how could you judge me
I was brought up in pain yall cant touch me
Police pursued me chased cuffed and subdued me
Talked to me rudely cause Im young rich and Im black
And living a movie not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city follow my crews
Bleek youre still with me nigga what did I say
Your time is coming you one hit away
Beans I aint trying to change you just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame
My momma loves me

You understand You know once you memorize a sentence
Its like an exercise

Intro
Yall niggas cant be serious right now
Im the all time heavyweight champion of flowers
Im leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now
Best flow most consistent realest stories
Most charisma I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter Holla

Verse 1
I jog in the graveyard spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
Thats why they call me Hova
Im far from being God but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep
Im catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused man and Im not afraid of death
And Im going all out I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block run pull up in a drop pull up
Push up on my money push up Im in great shape dunny woo
I keep jacks jumping thirty six sets
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats all white trainers
The ghettos Billy Blanks I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes yall niggas is amateurs
The fifth a dead lift if niggas dont want to get shot
Then yall niggas better squat I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers the spit from the fifth leave you wet
Lyrical exercise yall niggas aint tired right

Suckers get your weight up not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Yall aint ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad biceps triceps and quads
We dont struggle with undeveloped muscles
Yall aint real thats yall Achilles heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya I lift the weight of the watch
Off your arm remain nice and calm
Put down your things Trinidad of the game
Know my way around your ring
No matter how many pounds you bring
It sounds like the same old thing
ROC is the strongest team fuckers

Tend to hurries in ten places at once
Plus she cant front just peep how I run mines
Ma our time together is our time together and uh
Our time apart is our time apart

Verse 3 JAYZ
Im lookin for southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louis Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties attitude of the city
Pretty witty girly worldly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark short sorta tall
Slim kinda thick I swear I love em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isnt this great my flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine my game just rewinds

High stakes I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees cop in three
Deuce fever ISs fully loaded ah yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter niggas cant fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending whats the meaning
Im leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining brrrr

Im one of the best niggas that done it six digits and running
Yall niggas dont want it

Swear to God dont get it fucked up

Verse 2 JAYZ
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
Im deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo lanes
Screaming through the sunroof money aint a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life thats right you better learn
Why play with fire burn
We get together like a choir to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms produce Gs like sperm
Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows

Yeah yeah yeah yeah cause you cant knock the hustle

Chorus 2 Mary J Blige  JAYZ

My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks my crew something to watch

My motto stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne Cristals by the bottle
Its a damn shame what youre not though who me

My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas can a nigga see me
Got the US Open advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre son youre too eager

Lets get together and make this whole world believe us huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment until we even
Thieving as long as Im breathing
Cant knock the way a nigga eating fuck you even

To give you a piece of my mind

Spill three quarts of my blood into the street let alone the heat
Fuck em they hate a nigga lovin his life
In all possible ways know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin this is a minor setback
Yo still in all we livin just dream about the getback
That made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
Ill do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process
And I aint got nothin but time

Im feeling it feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Verse 1 JAYZ
I keep it realer than most I know you feeling it
Cristals on ice I like to toast I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate cos life is still a bitch and then you die
But for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us success they turned my mic up
Im bout to hit these niggas with some shit thatll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
JiggyJigga looking gully in the joint
If yall niggas aint talking bout large money whats the point

Chorus Mecca
Im feeling it fill the glass to the top with Mot
Feeling it feel the Lex pushing up on the set
Im feeling it feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Verse 2 JAYZ
Even if it aint sunny hey I aint complaining
Im in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplaning what shorty
Where you disappear to son Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers aint in
Im living the ill streets blues got you hunger pangin
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singing fool
Im thorough in every borough my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and
Ya feelin it To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit
95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with shit
And all the thoroughass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers cant really know Im loving it you feeling it

Chorus Mecca
Im feeling it fill the glass to the top with Mot
Feeling it feel the Lex pushing up on the set
Im feeling it feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Verse 3 JAYZ
What yall aint heard that nigga Jay hot
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed Id stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares ma those dreams that you say youve got
Give me the chills but these mills well they make me hot
Yall feel me enough to stop the illing right
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
Im so confused okay Im getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself look I dont need that now
Its just once in a blue when theres nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning me and this chick on the island and then were boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man
It got me going shit

Chorus Mecca
Im feeling it fill the glass to the top with Mot
Feeling it feel the Lex pushing up on the set
Im feeling it feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Verse 1
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak were all tryna win
But then again maybe its for the best though
Cause when theyre sayin too much
You know theyre tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldnt understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld granted
Ninetofive is how you survive I aint tryna survive
Im tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God I prayed to Gotti
Thats right its wicked  thats life I live it
Aint askin for forgiveness for my sins ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin their brains for angles on all the evils that the gamell do
It gets dangerous money and power is changin us
And now were lethal infected with Devils

Verse 2
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
Thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned so in turn Im kidnappin his babys mother
My hand around her collar feedin her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasnt convinced
I kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now Im tryna rock this bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know shes wishin we were still close
Dont cry it is to be in time
Ill take away your miseries and make it mine Devils

Verse 3
My flesh no nigga could test my soul is possessed
By Devils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin sticks
Like Homie you dont know me
But the whole world owe me strip
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin life
So now Im down for whatever aint nothin nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off  Momma forgive me
I cant be held accountable Devils beatin me down boo
Got me runnin with guys makin Gs tellin lies that sound true
Come test me I never cower
For the love of money son Im givin lead showers
Stop screamin you know the demon said its best to die
And even if Jehovah witness bet hell never testify Devils

Intro
Yeah hah yeah RocAFella
We invite you to somethin epic you know
Well we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin
But we feel we have nothin to lose
So we offer you well we offer our lives right
What do you bring to the table

Verse 1
While Im watchin every nigga watchin me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head both of them where they supposed to be
Hoesll get you sidetracked then clapped from close feet
I dont sleep Im tired I feel wired like codeine these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see
From sellin caine til brains was fried to a fricassee
Cant lie at the time it never bothered me
At the bar gettin my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin hard happy to be escapin poverty however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips for precipitation we stack chips hardly
The youth I used to be soon to see a millin
No more Big Willie my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin for revenues Rayful Edmondlike
Channel 7 News round seven jewels head dead in the mic
Forgettin all I ever knew convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer I know the procedure
Lock my body cant trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
Id rather die enormous than live dormant thats how we on it
Live at the main event I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin in codes since I sense you peekin
The NSX rental dont be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog what you tryin to get into
Viva Las Vegas see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin they reup
And we can have a pleasant time sippin margaritas

Hook
Gegegeyeahhh
Can I live

Verse 2
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus if driven wrong its sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it manifest it
In tangible goods platinum Rolexd it
We dont lease we buy the whole car as you should
My confederation dead a nation
Explode on detonation overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it even righteous minds go through this
True this the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin cream
Lets do this it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS  you see me stressed right

Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spendin that bitch

Come experience life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Place Marcy Brooklyn
Actions well yall know the actions

Verse 1 JayZ
Uhh I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
He likes the style and profile I think he want to mock
He likes the way I walk he see my money talking
To honies hawking Im the hottest nigga in New York and
I see his hunger pains I know his blood boils
He want to run with me I know this kid will be loyal
I watched him make a few ends to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then its just enough for reup again
I see myself in his eyes I moved from Levis
To Guess to Versace now its diamonds like Liberace
Thats just the natural cycle nobody want to be like Michael
Where Im from just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like AfroSheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little niggas peeps its time to put him on

Chorus JayZ  Memphis Bleek
Its time to come up and hold my own weight defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand my ground
Its time to come up stick up my chest and make some loot
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand on my own two

Verse 2 Memphis Bleek
Im out here slinging bringing the drama trying to come up
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
Im out here serving disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
Hes selling weight Im selling eight balls
Sixteen trying to graduate to pushing quarters yall
I aint going to sweat him Im a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
Im tired of being out here round the clock and breaking day
And chasing crack heads up the block for my pay
Im staying fresh so chickens check
Im trying to step up to the next level
Pushing Vettes through the jects diamonds reflect from the sun
Directly in your equilibrium and stunned
Im waiting for my day to come I got the urge to splurge
I dont want a lifetime sentence just give me the word

Chorus JayZ  Memphis Bleek
Its time to come up and hold my own weight defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand my ground
Its time to come up stick up my chest and make some loot
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand on my own two

Verse 3 JayZ and Memphis Bleek
Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me Holding down this block it aint nothing
You the man nigga now stop fronting
Hahah I like your style
Nah I like your style
Lets drive around awhile
Cool nigga
Heres a thou
A G I ride with you for free
I want the longterm riches and bitches
Have it all now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name skip the fame
Ten thou or a hundred G keep your shit the same
On the low
Yeah the only way to blow
You let your shit bubble quietly
AND THEN YOU BLOW
Hey keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Then you play your cards
Then he through dealing I understand
Dont blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And wont break them for nobody
Hah I like your resume pick a day you can start
From now until death do us part nigga

Chorus JayZ  Memphis Bleek
Its time to come up and hold my own weight defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand my ground
Its time to come up stick up my chest and make some loot
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand on my own two
Its time to come up and hold my own weight defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand my ground
Its time to come up stick up my chest and make some loot
Gots to lock it down and when they rush stand on my own two

Intro
Hah hah hah hah yeah yeah
What it is player
You player its all about you
How you gon say that man
If I had your hand Id turn mine in
Far as Im concerned if I had your hand I cut mines off
Hah man you know man Im just dealin that hoe money
You know hoe money is slow money but its sho money
Check this out man you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell em
Stick they hands in they panties grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window drop it like its hot

Verse 1
Uhh I talk jewels and spit diamonds all cherry
Like a hymen when Im rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga  JayZ lethal drugs
18carat gold pen when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like Im rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon you been warned
Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn slow when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didnt know Jays about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wines down your earlobe
Im smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate with this rich nigga rhetoric
Im solid gold I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your worldll never know
From New York to Paris the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when Im rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did Id cry ice
From my nigga Sauce I hit you with this advice
Lifes short so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard

Interlude
Whoooh Thats cashmere baby
Nah you know thats just laid back man

Verse 2
Check it out check it out
Ghettos Errol Flynn hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
Cause I walk like a piyimp talk like a mack man
The star player the golden bar layer
The sweet Ms Fine Thing puhlayah sho yo right
Im game tight so why should it change tonight
Go tell your peeps dog Im lethal until it aint right
I pimp hard on a trick look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch hop up on your good foot

RocAFella clique nigga

Verse 1 Sauce Money
Ayo we patting down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Slinging your dingaling from BedStuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me Jay and Primo got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man Ill stock a few Gs now its unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols just to see my shit discharge puss
I drop the stellar even acapella
I got to tell all about RocAFella

Chorus Fat Joe sample
Yeah bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

Verse 2 JayZ
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for JayZ to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile heres something dope for yall to lean
Liaison for days on end
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live did dough with my nigs dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv looking jig
Cant do for dolo had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
Thats real mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was OG Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco mano a mano
You aint ready I fondle trigger straight up shoot my guns horizontal get your weight up I am
Two point two pounds
Youre barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldnt expect yall to understand this money
Do the knowledge due to few dollars Im due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you what the fuck

Chorus Fat Joe
Bring it on if you think you can hang

Verse 3 Big Jaz
Money is power Im energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldnt assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the UN
So what the fuck you doing Whatever nigga
Fahrvergngen rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada fly farther
Fry hotter you die gotta fuck with me witness maana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to OTB you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

Chorus Fat Joe sample
Yeah bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah bring it on if you think you can hang

Intro
Stress
Sunshine shade geyeah

Verse 1
I sold it all from crack to opium
In third person I dont wanna see em
So Im rehearsin with my peoples how to G em
From a remote location in the BM
Scopin the whole situation like Damn
Metamorphic as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
Its difficult to read em
The windows to his soul were half closed I put the key in
Pulled off slow hopin my people fleein
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape exchangin dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin my people bailed out like TimeWarner
Awaitin a call from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time stress givin this shit up fuck

Chorus 1
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop dont forget
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated never forget
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets

Verse 2
As sure as this Earth is turnin souls burnin
In search of higher learnin
Turnin in every direction seekin direction
My moms cryin because her insides are dyin
Her son tryin her patience keep her heart racin
A million beats a minute I know I push you to your limit
But its this game Love Im caught up all in it
They make it so you cant prevent it never give it
You gotta take it cant fake it I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin
Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Dont wanna shoot him but I got him
Trapped within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions no time shits stressin
My life found I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man cant turn back the hands
Once its too late gotta learn to live with regrets

Chorus 2
You used to hold me told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
When I was young you used to hold me
Told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets

Verse 3
I found myself reminiscin remember this one
When he was here he was crazy nice with his son
I miss him long as Im livin hes livin through memories
Hes there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven lookin over me or in hell keepin it cozy
Im comin life on these streets aint what its supposed to be
Remember Newton mutual friend
Well me and him feudin on your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas think they guns can stop four niggas
Frontin like theyre Big Willie but really owe niggas
Hoe niggas this year Ill show niggas  think Im slippin
Im about to send you a roommate no bullshittin
But my hustles goin too well to hit him
You was right niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway I aint tryin to hear it I think Im touched
This whole verse I been talkin to your spirit a little too much

Chorus 1
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop dont forget
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated never forget
In order to survive gotta learn to live with regrets

Intro Melisa Morgan JayZ
Cause you cant knock the hustle
Ohh uuuuuuahyeah uuuuuuooooooh
Foooooools paradise
JayZ ha ha Melisa Morgan
You better think twice
RocAFella yall it dont stop cause its not very nice

Verse 1 JayZ
We about to change this game dear
Check my pockets aint nothing but game there
I remain without fear keep the lames clear
And the cats thats all about scratch remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My names like a swear
Dropped off every tier
Now yall can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the missive peep how they script it
We got to hit you every night fore we hit the lights its type addictive
Need cash to live with the beat goes on
Every day is a hustle the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low like sixfours of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
And I hope you shine
Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
Cant knock the hustle

Chorus 1 Melisa Morgan JayZ
Im taking out this time uh huh uh huh
To give you a piece of my mind
Cause you cant knock the hustle how we do
Who do you think you are
Maybe one day youll be a star

Verse 2 JayZ
Check this
In a mans world need a girl to touch something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light then trust something
When I get home then its on
Girl just crack your shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moans turns to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis Queens
Life with me consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear kickin dirt cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks stay out my bizziness
Know they cant love it trips to LA with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash champagne spilled on me
Steak still warm on me

Chorus 2 Melisa Morgan JayZ
Cause you cant knock the hustle
But until then baby Im the one whos crazy uh huh
Cause thats the way youre making me feel how we how we do
The way youre making me feel cause you cant knock the hustle
I dont want no romance I just want the chance
Cant knock the hustle for real ha

Verse 3 JayZ
Ever since I retired working alongside of live wires
To this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
I guess Im biased cause what I talk about I live
These rap dudes conflicted
Some of them aint even rapping for chips
WHAT PART OF THE GAME IS THIS
Seems brainless on tours like whores guess what Im saying I miss
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks ended up with gold Acs
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On their way to me through you screw you
Gun blew you out of one then two shoes
Run through you like UM EXCUSE YOU
But thats my cash gotta understand your hustle
But thats my cash you dont understand
Let my dough pass you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club but dont knock the hustle

Chorus 1  2 Melisa Morgan JayZ
Im taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day youll be a star
But until then baby Im the one whos crazy
Cause thats the way you making me feel
Cause you cant knock the hustle
I dont want no romance I just want the chance
Cant knock the hustle for real
Cause you cant knock the hustle

Yeah is yall niggas finished yo

Got your little radio play your little BDS huh
You finished nigga Huh huh yall finished
Can I live huh
Can I live youre being stingy with the fucking music again yo

Verse 1 JayZ
Yo yo yo I blacks out I pulls the MAC out
Scream whats that about then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on through the rotten
Dont even hate on those who hate me I got Pac on
Feeling it feeling it chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over Jigga react militant
Speed off officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher then return the devils fire
Im raised different react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows create criminal odes
Sing along if yall with me til the end of the road
Im cynical when in the view of the public
And this is because Im defensive when Im in interviews
The percentage who dont understand is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself what percentage is you

Refrain JayZ
Can I live for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
And black guns stack ones yo
Can I live for all my chicks pigeontoed
Stand bowlegged like a bulldog know what I mean huh
Can I live to all the ceelo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll heads yo
Can I live to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight niggas

Verse 2 JayZ
I got the Feds sending me letters cause Im schooling the youth
But they cant lock me down cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living thats a given
Why is it Why dont yall try to visit the neighborhoods I live in
My mind been through hell my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when Im needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

Verse 3 Memphis Bleek
Ayo theres money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends Ima knock em on they ass
Not to brag sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out let one out let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that its my block to burn
That credit you dead it
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and using the right cut
One thing thats fucked up is bad dope that I cant pump
This slab gotta reup and rebag
Blend it in with the raw bubble it fast cop more
Once I get it I got it I lock it nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block bitch on some blacktop shit
What you want nigga What you want nigga
What you want what you want nigga

Outro JayZ
Can I live
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat
Tryin to win with the construction Timbs yo
Can I live
Yo USA all my chicks that strip
Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams
Two kids one job and no man
All my chicks gettin that washing set with their welfare check
Haha all the mamis dame un beso alright
All my niggas rocking them fitted caps
Trying to get at this rap know what I mean
All my cats with open cases big cars and no license
I like that shit I see yall
All my niggas that say pause after they say some fucked up shit Hahahahaha rock on and uh Jigga shit RocAFella forever yo

Intro Pain in Da Ass
Somebodys pulling me closer to the ground
I aint panicked I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I aint no rapper Im a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
Okay Im reloaded

Hook Aaliyah
A million

Interlude JayZ
I did it again niggas
Fucked up right I know
I know what yall niggas asking yourself
Is he gonna ever fall off No

Verse 1 JayZ
A lot of speculation on the monies Ive made honeys Ive slayed
How is he for real Is that nigga really paid
Hustlers Ive met or dealt with direct
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a TEC
Whats the position you hold
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck but only your single goin gold
If RocAFella should fold and youre left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O
For the millionth time askin me
Questions like Wendy Williams harrassin me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe And in that minute you leave
While Im looking at my Rol ice spinnin on my sleeve
Ughh nice watch do you really have a spot
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so what block
What you doin in LA with Filipinos and eses
Latinos and Chevys down by Pico with Frederico
I answer all your questions but then yall got to go
Now the question I ask you is how bad you wanna know BLAOW

Hook Aaliyah
A million

Interlude JayZ
RocAFella yall uhh uh
Know my style

Verse 2 JayZ
Motherfuckers cant rhyme no more bout crime no more
Til Im no more cause Im so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasnt for me niggas still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back admirin yours
Youngblood you better get that we frying because
Niggas dont want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And dont listen to the rappers they dying to floss
I used to be OT applyin the force
Shoot up the whole block then the iron I toss
Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross
Im the boss and this is how its gon be
Burnt the turnpike wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed til they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek
Chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read He was holdin no leaks
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game Jigga the OG
On MTV telling em how I sold D
And used to bag work up out of apartment 4B
Me and my homie started out coDs
Picked the mailbox lock cause I aint have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made Sophie
Then I went low key but now Im back its on
Motherfuckers

And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So Im hoping you different Let you push the 6 and

Verse One
Look if I shoot you Im brainless
But if you shoot me then youre famous
Whats a nigga to do
When the streets is watching blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break make your first mistake
Cant ignore it thats the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money and twentyfive I cant afford it
Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates
Niggas you bought it I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted you and your mans get a pass
This rhyme youre operating on bitch time
Yall niggas aint worth my shells all yall niggas
Trying to do is hurt my sales and stop trips to John Meneilly
The type to start a beef then run to the cops
When I see you in the street got one in the drop
When Id rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
The streets is watching

Hook
When the streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break make your first mistake
Cant ignore it

Verse Two
Now its hard not to kill niggas
Its like a full time job not to kill niggas cant chill
The streets is watching
When you froze your arms
Niggas want to test you when your gun goes warm
Cant get caught with your feet up got to keep your heat up
Sweet niggas running round swearing shit is sweeter
Once youre tagged lame the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggas want to steal you
Broke niggas dont want no cash they just want to kill ya
For the name niggas dont know the rules
Disrespecting the game want you to blow your cool
Force your hand of course that mans plotting
Smarten up the streets is watching its on

Hook
When the streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break make your first mistake
Cant ignore it

Verse Three
My street mentality flip bricks forever
Know me and money we like armed codefendants
Nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder until secret indictment time came around
And you can look up and down the streets and I cant be found
Put in twentyfour hour shifts but that aint me now
Got a face too easy to trace niggas mouths got slow leaks
Had to hire a team of workers couldnt play those streets
See out of space like Mercury you jerkin me Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
I said this Lets play fair and we can stay here
Im trying to transform you boys to men like daycare
Ay theres money to be made and niggas got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us
Half of my staff had warrants
The other half in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me
For the first time in my life I was getting money
But it was like my conscience was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me Was he saying that
I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back
Like bad coke pimp or die was my mind frame bad
Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack
Aint a whole lot of brain to that
Just trying to maintain a stack
And not collide like two trains thats on the same track
But get my life together like the oils I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where the water gets hot
Got my transporter take it across the border then stop
To set up shop with a quarter of rock
Heres the plan
For three straight weeks niggas slaughtered the block
But you know the game is food it fucked up me and my dudes
One drought can wipe a nigga out faster than the cops
And this unstable way of living just had to stop
Half of my niggas got time we done real things
By 94 became the subject of half of yall niggas rhymes
Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit
But thats the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit
The life and times of a demonic mind excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me and if you dont like it then fine
The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me

The saga continues
Motion picture shit

Im done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air one woke him
Son soaking sweating in his bed like dun locin
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally realized who was the culprit
I said yeah remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you dont ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now you try to rise I wave the gun  lay down
This time youre really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasnt meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys
And it was an afterthought that maybe youll try to avenge me
But I was like Nah Homes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul note you would sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And thats really no fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my minds like a flower in bloom
Peep how my eyes just scour the room
Im alert plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out in a twohotel town
Come on now I peeped your Lexus as you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested rudely interrupted
Jamaican accents Boy you know who you dun fucked with
A gun in your face and thats all you can come up with
Im done talking back up and clap im one in the abdomen

Intro Jay Z
How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in
Theres gotta be them times youll be wrong nah mean
How can a mutha fucka go round and hate a nigga
He never even met that he dont even know and shit
I think this rap shit is all beef

Verse 1 Jay Z
Yall dont even know every day Im living with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Cant even enjoy myself at a party unless
Im on the dance floor hotass vest
You think Im freakin these chicks right
I try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
Its gon be on both feet never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts fine
Well lose two lives yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor drippin tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didnt budge it was him or me
And I aint trying to be hard but Im guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be starsLucky me

Hook Karen Anderson
You only know what you see
You dont understand what it takes to be me

Verse 2 Jay Z
I hate all girls with ulterior motives
Thats why Im 20 years old no sons no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice right I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that faggot get your own
Hate that I cant roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day Ima have to flip cmon
You know the shit dont stop til the Cris dont pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist dont lock
Im trapped the whole worlds against me in fact
It aint no turning back Bring it on
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
Can I live without yall niggas saying I floss too much
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us Lucky me

Hook Karen Anderson
You only know what you see
You dont understand what it takes to be me

Bridge Jay Z
Since I was 4 years old I been told everything that glitters aint gold
And now that Ive arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold

Verse 3 Jay Z
Nigga see you in the street pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hem me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But Gs is heaven bound so how Im gon receive
Anything yall pour to the ground next time throw it up
And aint nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Dont grieve for me my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life
Though I cant see past the girls greed to call her wife
Next time youre thinking heist better be precise
Cause Im fully prepared One of us is gon leave here
I have no regrets even though I wont see grow
My godson Boogie Sonny and Remo

You only know what you see
You dont understand what it takes to be me

Verse 1 JayZ
We started out makin small time bacon
Two little niggas bakin talkin bout whippin cakes
Get clothin and big cheddar hopin it gets better
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever
In front of your buildin clockin thought I was makin a killin
Right in front of your children eightball in my side pocket
They was corrupt too disrespectin the fiends I used to
Look up to take it or leave it fuck you
In different parts of the planet Oakland to New York
Im hollerin Lifetimes he hollerin Lifes Too hort
Parallel lives and jewels held high
To the Range to the Rove get exchanged for your souls
You know how the game goes slang to get Gs
And speak in Chinese everybody gains the same dough
Get your shit scarred fuckin with my sick squad
From Marcy to the Bay yall we get large Beeeeyeeotch

Hook

Verse 2 Too hort
So now you own a record label I got one too
We on a roll now cant nobody stop our crew
You can treat us like convicts you know we got records
On the shelf and on the charts the double deckers
The fat donkey house down the block belongs to me
You criticize the way I walk you wanna see my bankbook
Im not a crook I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid everday
I see the same old shit I see in the streets
I know you think Im sellin keys but I only sell beats
Dopefiend music its drug related
You can buy it on the corner get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about
I know these gay ass record labels keep fuckin niggas
Its just like in the streets main how much you get

Hook

Verse 3 Too hort
Thats right I been a hustler for a long time
Always got the right beats never saying wrong rhymes

There aint no dollar amount that can make me happy
Fine women a big house a truck and a Caddy

See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke
Uhh RocaFella
Geyeah

Verse 1
We treat this rap shit just like handlin weight
What they want we give it to em what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment let him know its at stake
Put his ass in the studio let him cook up a cake
When its hot get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot the momandpops is the gate
But first we scope shit advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey we got some dope shit
Gon need a middle man so we look to radio
Let em test the product give em a promo show
Just a breeze not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five
Aint tryin to kill em at first just buildin clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks its on sale
But when demand grows its time to expand yo
You dont want no garbage papi its ten grand per blow fo sho

Hook
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke

Verse 2
Gegegeyeah
I got that uncut raw to make a fiends body jerk
Got your whole block now pumpin my work
My CDs is like keys for you Willies who
Like to floss my cassette tapes in sixtytwos
And my singles like gems you know the treys
Get you high for a while but the high dont stay
You need another fix you better cop these last two bricks
Cause when this shit flip Imma get on some other shit
Never pitchin for a label Jiggas the hookup
You know my shit is fish scale yall niggas is cook up
Just blow up scream my name from Brooklyn to Dakota
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda
Went from an eighth to a quarter to a half a key
Prioritys work wasnt right so I switched factories
Now Im the new nigga who figured Id get the game locked
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop

Intro
Uh huh gege gegegeah
Yeyeyeah yeyeyeah Brooklyn
How real is this How real is this Brooklyn
Uhhuh huh Brooklyn
Respect this here check

Verse 1
Im from where the hammers rung news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I gave straight bets
So I felt Im owed something and you nothing check
Im from the other side where the other guys dont walk too much
And girls in the projects wouldnt fuck us said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I dont know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us
Im from where the beef is inevitable summertimes unforgettable
Boosters in abundance buy a halfprice sweater new
Your word was everything so everything you said youd do
You did it couldnt talk about it if you aint lived it
Im from where niggas pull your card And argue all day about
Whos the best MCs Biggie JayZ and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve and thugs are at odds
At each others throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases hoping the judge RandRs
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars is that all
Im from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
Im from Marcy son just thought Id remind yall

Chorus
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Brooklyn so where you from

Verse 2
Im from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you cant put your vest away and say youll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after well be saying Damn I was just with him yesterday
Im a block away from hell not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a handheld weight scale
Youre laughing you know the place well where the liquor stores and the base well
And government Fuck government Niggas politick theyselves
Where we call the cops the ATeam cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize
If the shit is lies God strike me and I got a question
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me Well never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow Id let em know
The stakes and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled still I feel my job aint done
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice

Chorus
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Brooklyn so where you from

Verse 3
Im from where they crossover and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords listen
Im up the block around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets twisted off leak
And no matter the weather niggas know how to draw heat
Whether youre fourfeet or Manute size it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they deuce was live now I hit em with trips
And I reached down for their money pa forget about this
This time around its platinum like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist yall cant do shit about this
Niggasll show you love thats how they fool thugs
Before you know it youre lying in a pool of blood where Im from

Chorus
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
Cough up a lung where Im from Marcy son aint nothing nice
Mentally been many places but Im Brooklyns own
So where you from

Intro Kelly Price
Throughout my life
No matter what Ive done
Youve been merciful and your love endureth
Through all things
For that I am eternally grateful

Verse 1 JayZ
Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench til I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face still you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me Dont let em hold you back
What I do I turned around and I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that still Im drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now youre not to blame
You was newly separated tryin to escape ya world
And through my thirst I didnt help you I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody that created crack
Had me thinkin the newest kicks and the latest gat
Still havent apologized so please play this back
While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act
You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about how the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came
Thats a savage youre the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and I aint shit
Glad you got yourself together no thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me

Hook Kelly Price
You must love me
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me
Ohh yeah

Verse 2 JayZ
We used to fight every night but I never would suffer
Just smile my big brothers tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense real intense as we got older
Never believed it would lead to me poppin one in your shoulder
Where my rings Knew you had it cause you took too long
As Mickey Annie and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin and puffin gun in my hand told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was beggin for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined
Drove me berzerk saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused I just closed my young eyes and squeezed
What a sound Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn what the fuck I done now
Runnin around in a circle thinking Im assed out
Hot gun burnin my waist ran straight to Jaz house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene how could I go out that way
Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
You must love me

Hook Kelly Price
You must love me
What after all the wrong Ive done
I know you must

Verse 3 JayZ
Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people that I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us
You put the pressure on me daily rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no
When it was one of those days when nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip out of town
Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face asking me could you go
Im agreed said sender everythingll go smooth
Just tell her what to do and everythingll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs As you boarded the plane
Couldnt explain these strange feelings that I caught and the pain
Im thinkin why would I send you when I knew it aint right
Im thinkin what would make you sacrifice ya life
You must love me

Hook Kelly Price
You must love me repeats in background
After everything that Ive done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
Youve always shown it
You love me yea yeah
Oh yeah
I know that you love me

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And Im wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And Im wishing on all the loving weve ever done

Verse 3 JayZ
We used to play taptap for rap tracks
Run catch and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older males sneak and drink old champale
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lees Dungarees
Into the Hawaiian shorts relying on sports
To take us away from here but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
In the mirror
My siblings used to back me up
Like Doug E Fresh and Ricky D Eric Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me each of yall
Lets reach for the stars now Jigga

Hook Gwen Dickey
Im wishing on a star to follow where you are
Im wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And Im wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And Im wishing on all the loving weve ever done

Intro Pain in Da Ass
Sorry boys
But all the money in the world couldnt bring me back again
Lay down lay down
Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy
Always knew Id make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
The last of the real hustlers well maybe not the last
Bleeks gonna be a good rapper
New improved JayZ  I quit
Im retiring aint enough money in this game to keep me around
Sorry Big I tried honest
Cant go with me on this ride though Im callin the shots
The bars closing where we going to for breakfast
RocaFella yall  OKAY Im RELOADED

Bridge
Bringin the drama
Tryin to come up in the gameMarcy
Add a couple of dollar signs to my nameRocAFella yall
One of the best
Waitin for my day to come
Just give me the word

Verse 1 Memphis Bleek
Nah this aint Jigga its your lil nigga Bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street
Game I peeped those my mind so advanced
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez I represent for all those
With 28 grams on a comeup tryin to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey Ds
First gun two bullets niggas know I do pull it
Niggas tryin to kill me dog who wouldnt
Screw Gooden I pitch in the PJs
Lit off the EJ I split Dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that owe me cream bring her
Last seen with Bing he got dropped between us
Shit is constant thats why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense who wants it
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man Im tryin to come up on yall get one up on yall
Thats why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on yall
Mama said keep bullshittin theyll kill you dead
One week of this hustlin brought a living room set
Went to Tom Ds niggas mad veins out
Copped the Jordans two weeks before they came out
Flashy fly little nigga
Nosy bitch from the third floor like Why little nigga
Bitch please twist the trees
Took a long pull like bitch to breathe
Thats my answer lifes like cancer
And Im serious

Verse 1
From standin on the corners boppin
To drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot with the smoke Glock
Fleein the murder scene you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell my only hell
But since when yall niggas know me to fail Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your tits and whatnot
Im from the school of the hard knocks you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Lets stick up the world and split it 5050 uhhuh
Lets take the dough and stay real jiggy uhhuh
And sip the Cris and get pissypissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie baby
You know its hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter nigga Volume 2
Yall niggas get ready

Hook

We live in hard knocks
We dont take over we borrow blocks
Burn em down and you can have it back
Daddy Id rather that
I flow for chicks wishin they aint have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers thats born to clock

I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines to green 5s
Ive seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze
Lifes ills then I put it down type Braille

Got a lotta beef so logically I prey on my foes
Hustlin is still inside of me and as far as progress
Youd be hardpressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint and yall lamed out
Didnt really appreciate it til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums nonstop for ya nigga

Hook
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated we get tricked
Instead of kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life

Chorus JayZ
If I should die dont cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when Im gone dont mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when its real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die

Verse 1 JayZ
Dont cry my niggas its been one hell of a ride my niggas
In the middle of the drought I flipped pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J Blige my niggas
Ive eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels dropped school still didnt fail
Rhymes still written well hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then Im gettin my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Dont get it twisted like braids if Im missed its okay
But lifes short dont miss a day uhh

Chorus JayZ
If I should die dont cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when Im gone dont mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when its real

If I should die

Chorus Wais
 dont cry my niggas
Its been one hell of a ride my niggas
Say word to Wais my niggas
When Im gone dont mourn my niggas
Just keep gettin it on my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas

Verse 2 Wais
I got a lot to look back on in 88 got my crack on
Ten years later gettin my rap on
Gettin shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks and pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got demands to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real
And how was Kennedy killed
I aint mad I mustve smoked a ton of reefer
Sipped Coronas with Latifah broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side Ima see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then its on again if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
And tell him never have a friend
Just family reincarnated Ill shorten the time
That I waited to get paid tell him never be afraid
Niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo blood run thicker
Never shed tears cry liquor my nigga

Chorus Wais
If I die dont cry my niggas
Its been one hell of a ride my niggas
Say word to Wais my niggas
When Im gone dont mourn my niggas
Just keep gettin it on my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas

Chorus Half Dead
 dont cry my niggas
Just stay gettin high my niggas
Dont wonder why my niggas
When Im gone live on my niggas
Just follow my path my niggas
Say word to Half my nigga

Verse 3 Half Dead
Im the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
Born to live forever through lifes struggles
I cut corners and took drastic measures
See you niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me too often I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feelin haunted
Ready to leave this world that Im lost in
My only chance to see the seeds I lost through abortion
When Im gone yall niggas better not mourn keep flossin
As long as my name lives on whats most important
Ill be down in hell scorchin preparin for life
Afterlife still torchin and blazin these mics
Itd rain for 40 days and 40 nights
And Id return on the 3rd like Christ
Without my physical portion
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
Ill be back through the Heights tomorrow
Blood over yall fake niggas door
What you thought huh
What you thought nigga

Chorus Half Dead
If I should die dont cry my niggas
Just stay gettin high my niggas
Dont wonder why my niggas
When Im gone live on my niggas
Just follow my path my niggas
Say word to Half my nigga
When I die

Chorus Wais
 dont cry my niggas
Its been one hell of a ride my niggas
Say word to Wais my niggas
When Im gone dont mourn my niggas
Just keep gettin it on my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas
If I die

Chorus JayZ
 dont cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when Im gone dont mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when its real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die

Verse 4 JayZ
Id tell Big theyre still hearin his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin in the physical form
Is everything thats invisible gone
I need to know will I still feel pain or will it be ironic
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain
Can I re veal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place
Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly
Can I still touch lives answer their whats and whys
Make sure everybody in my fam clutch five
If I should die
dont cry my niggas

Intro JayZ  Too hort
Uhhuh
Thats right
It was all good just a week ago
Uhhuhuh it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh uhhuhuh had this all good just a week ago
I had the money had the cars the bitches
Uhhuh yeah it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry
And then my motherfuckin niggas started snitchin
Uhhuh uh uh yo yo
Beatch

Verse 1 JayZ
Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems I called on him he called on me
We wasnt quite partners I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah we spoke much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me we both fled quickly
Wasnt quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught and thats when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted but when I reached the phone
Hes talkin reckless I can sense deceit in his tone
I said Damn dog What nine weeks and youre home
He said Main man you think shits sweet cause youre home
I just sat spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleachin your dome youre reachin
I said The world dont stop I got to keepkeep on
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Cant be too safe cause niggas is twofaced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
Its on

Chorus Too hort  JayZ
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I dont see how this side of you could be provoked
Uhhuh uhhuh it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Verse 2 JayZ
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game blind as hell
I did a little better had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail
Seventeen and Im holdin on to around a mill
I could bail out blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty down to fight to round 30
Freezin on them corners still holdin my crack
Lookin up and down the block the fuck is the dough at
Came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said Im never going back
Im from Marcy and Marcy dont raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts you cant be serious

Chorus Too hort  JayZ
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I dont see how this side of you could be provoked
Uhhuh uhhuh it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Verse 3 JayZ
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin some things
All this after a week in the bing
Im mad at myself cause I didnt spot the weakling
I wouldve bet the house you wouldnt speak a thing
Nigga this was the oath to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas what happened to that
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it the same thing make you laugh make you cry thats right
The same game that make you math could make you die
Thats life Its a dice game and sometimes you crap
Who wouldve thought youd get popped one time and rat
Now you know thats bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up like This is my dad
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
Youll always be in jail nigga just minus the bars

Chorus Too hort  JayZ
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I dont see how this side of you could be provoked
Uhhuh uhhuh it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Outro Too hort
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin
We was one step away from takin this crack money
And recyclin it through the ghettos

Intro JayZ  Memphis Bleek
Uhhuh uh yeah gigigeyeah

Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Plus a nigga prices down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I dont know whats wrong with Bleek

Verse 1 JayZ  Memphis Bleek
It seems Im like Keenan picking up on the vibe
That he aint too happy I could just see it in his eyes
I dont know if its the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
Matching the gator shirt softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting trying to take my shine
I didnt say this verbally just had some shit on my mind
Plus Im puffin like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they aint used to stuff
They had me thinking Shit Im the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff
Swear to God they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke Jigga whattup

Chorus Memphis Bleek JayZ
I done came up uhh put my life on the line uhh
Soaked the game up yeah now its my time to shine
Time to change up what no more second in line
Nineeight these streets is mine
Uhhuh uhhuh uhhuhuhhuhuhhuh

Verse 2 JayZ  Memphis Bleek
Look at that fake smile he just gave me its breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart
I felt his hatred it was harsh  fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uhoh this nigga Jay he aint slow he musta picked up on the vibe
That had I not been so high I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him
To the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest but those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused
Im trying to concentrate but its like hes reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him I was down for the cause
As he approached Whattup Bleek and I paused

Chorus Memphis Bleek  JayZ
I done came up uhh put my life on the line uhh
Soaked the game up yeah now its my time to shine
Time to change up what no more second in line
Nineeight these streets is mine

Yeah you done came up uhh put your life on the line uhh
Soaked the game up yeah now its yo time to shine
Time to change up no more second in line
Nineeight these streets is mine

Verse 3 JayZ  Memphis Bleek
Right yo we wild out in Vegas styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers this life dont love us
So til death do us Im never breaking my bond
Nigga we Lex movers V12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up in a stance like And what
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in times the answer
Seems mindblowing this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going trust me nigga Im knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50 not 6040
Oh God dont let him control yall
Your gun is my gun your clip is my clip baby
Your fun is my fun your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay Im feeling for you
I aint only touching you Im killing your crew
Give it a year youll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold nigga perfect your role

Chorus Memphis Bleek  JayZ
I done came up uhh put my life on the line uhh
Soaked the game up yeah now its my time to shine
Time to change up what no more second in line
Nineeight these streets is mine

Yeah you done came up uhh put your life on the line uhh
Soaked the game up yeah now its yo time to shine
Time to change up no more second in line
Nineeight these streets is mine

Outro JayZ

More arms than Green Bays Brett Favre for ya
Money propositions hope thats not a prob for ya
If so Jigga be here day after tomorrow for ya thats right

Verse 2 JayZ
I got my two guns I came to scoop ones
A down ass bitch and she down to click
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with
And my plan is not to leave this town til Im rich
Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip I turn around and spit
Not to hit em just to let em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
Im in search of them young niggas that hug the block
All day til its light gray outside
Shoot dice talking shit all day outside
And even when its hot they outside
Let em know how its gonna go Bonnie and Clyde
And ayo you would want me on your side

Chorus Foxy Brown  JayZ

Verse 3 JayZ
Yo yeah I got that stress and I got it the best
I aint got it to give but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down all you gotta invest
Is your time I gotta move this in a week or less
For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess
The Rolex necklaces with the VVS
Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I aint sold em a dream I just showed em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Yo never lay your head where you holding them things
Keep the family then your business nothing goes in between
Never feared no man put four in his bean
Drop your gun then blow the scene ya heard me

Chorus Foxy Brown  JayZ
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta touch that love that paper dog uhh
Gotta get that paper dog
Gotta have that grab that paper dog

Album Vol 2 Hard Knock Life
    
Intro Sheek Louch
Fuck  shit is real right here
RocAFella LOX taking the streets over motherfuckers
Dont get it twisted

Verse 1 Sheek Louch
Yo ayo ayo ayo
Yo shut the fuck up fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask look at the camera like what
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me I spaz like Im on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like Im looking for a deal
If I aint hungry who the fuck is Im worse than them African kids
I aint straight til my numbers match the Motorola bids
And walk the streets up in NY like I dont fucking care
If I aint strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine yall talk shit like little children
But wanna ride mine like bitches when I walk up in the building
Cause I catch tans in the winter with wild whores
Jetskiing while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot flooding your block the best way
Professionally theyll find poison in your XRay
As I get roasted looking at Biggie posted on my wall
Taking shots of Louie til I fall
Nutting to lose just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster til I swear Big moved
My team you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and dont give a fuck what its costing

Verse 2 Beanie Sigel
Yo yo pressure bust pipes its time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggas lock it down yall know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5s a 6 a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggas wanna test vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name And test my game
Until you have me test my aim
Yall niggas nuts like testicles
Hit you up in your apartment building vestibule
Perhaps its best for you to keep on walking
Heat from the Larkin keep on sparking
Platinum prezzie Bezzie stay sparkling
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken when its hawking
Out on the strip until I reach the margin
Not trying to meet the Sergeant at the precinct
Eating cheese sandwiches down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans

Verse 3 Jadakiss
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then Im killing your pops
You feeling The LOX nigga why you grilling The LOX
If this rap shit dont work niggas still in the spot
You bring it to me I gotta lose your family
Gangstas dont die they get chubby and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it the weathers nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape you gon buy it I put it in a bag
You gon try it yall niggas cant deny it
Lot of cats still trying to study my last bounce
Tell you what get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I cant be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve and my hardhat
Dont matter if Im opening up or headline
Doing the speed limit or pushing red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
Ima be the Kiss nigga until its bedtime
Anything Im on is a classic any nigga
Ever had beef with son is a bastard
Anytime I spit spit acid LOX
Ruff Ryder you heard We got the game mastered

Interlude Pain in Da Ass
I told you the pain was coming
You wouldnt listen
You tried to play me like a joke
Now who got the last laugh
Now take these bullets with you to hell

Verse 4 Sauce Money
You motherfuckers is sick dont think Sauce the shit
So many niggas on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me falling off Im camera shy
Hammers fly might miss you but your manll die
Whats the difference Either way Im sonning your crew
I fuck to win yall niggas coming to lose
Something to prove Spit it we can have a spray off
I lay off wack niggas and kill em on my day off
Aint nutting for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
Im a mil stacking nigga who pull quick still packing
For you Phil Jackson niggas on that Bull shit

Verse 5 Styles P JayZ
I dont give a FUCK who you are so FUCK who you are
I dont care about a pretty bitch watch or a car
I dont care about your block and whoever you shot
I dont care about your album and whenever it drop
I dont care about your past if I did I woulda asked
Im too busy lighting dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit Im ten steps ahead of niggas
Shooting backwards just for practice
Ride or die nigga hopping in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you blow the L with you
Tell the whole world Im spitting let em know the shells hit you
I tell niggas quick suck dick and get a Glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve oclock
Im half past seven bust six then eleven
You know me slide my man my joint say reload me
I Ruff Ryde and pop a fella for RocAFella
Screaming what the fuck spending mozzarella

Verse 6 JayZ
I know pop you cant stand us cause we cock them hammers
Run in your crib no prisoners pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer Nope popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang big chains aint shit changed
Get brain in the four dot six Range
Shit mayne switch lanes
Every town I hit switch planes bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut you take it in vein to the brain
Muhfuckas is nodding and throwing up you know that
You dont wanna owe that man
Hell hit you get the picture Kodak man
Gotta love for war I dont floss no more
I just sit on my money til Im above the law
How the fuck you gon stop us with your measly asses
We dont stop at the tolls we got EZ passes nigga
Multiple cars and divas with DClasses
Iceberg sweats with IB on the elastic

Verse 1 JayZ
As a youngun dumb and gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldnt take the pain
And had to numb it with base
Couldnt drink the Henny straight I needed somethin to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back leavin nothin to waste
Lifes like a treadmill niggas runnin in place
Gettin nowhere fast a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin til the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot linen cop hot cars and hot women
If its not him then you got it confused yall not rememberin
My motto is simply I will not lose
Abide by the block rules I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it let me know anybody want it
Im raised irrational ways misunderstood
If you aint live like I live then one with the hood
I done what I could to come up with this paper til this day still
Run with the hood guess its part of my nature
If hell awaits a nigga Im comin with the razors
Still flashin ya shit try to pass me in a six
Type classy on the wrist every bit of 30 karats
This is not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life I shall return

Chorus Liz Leite JayZ
How tight is your flow cause Im like that yo

Verse 2 JayZ

Overachiever I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper

Cause I go in deeper I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers ha ha
Fuck hot my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off bout to snooze off

You dudes is too soft why I dont fuck with you all

But other than that I dont be fuckin with cats
Just me Ty and BHigh thug it like that
E Dame and Biggs whats fuckin with that
Yall can never diss Jigga get nothin for that
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back ha ha

Ima try my best and if you real like I real

Any nigga realer than me is in a messhall with their chest out
Any rapper with less clout sell more records than me

And anything involved with my name regardless of the fame

My boy died and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher you aint my man fuck ya

Chorus Jermaine Dupri and JayZ
In the Ferrari or Jaguar switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out money aint a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashing the rings
With the window cracked holla back money aint a thang
Jigga I dont like it if it dont gleam clean
And to hell with the price cause the money aint a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs thats locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks new whips money aint a thang
Come on yall wanna floss with us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper baby toss it up
Ya slacking on your pimping turn it up
See the money aint a thang

Verse 1 JayZ
I flex the Rol sign a check for yo ho
Jiggas style is love X and O
Save all your accolades just the dough
My game is wide all lames aside
Trying to stay alive hundred thou for the bracelet
Foolish aint I The chainll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders your moneys too young
See me when it gets older ya bank account grow up
Mines is onezerozerozeroohdoub
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up its all basic

Rob your stash house doubled out down in Vegas
Me and JD got it locked crazy

Type of dude that will do shit you wont do cant do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold too much to handle
In the black Clow he know if she look
She go byebye with dada and I aint gotta say no mo
Im The Truth like AI got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I dont know about yall but every night I swing

Chorus Jermaine Dupri and JayZ
In the Ferrari or Jaguar switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out money aint a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashing the rings
With the window cracked holla back money aint a thang
Jigga I dont like it if it dont gleam clean
And to hell with the price cause the money aint a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs thats locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks new whips money aint a thang
Yall wanna floss with us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin turn it up
See the money aint a thang

Verse 3 JayZ  Jermaine Dupri
Yall shit aint for real til yall ship a mil
And ya hit a RB chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace started relaxing
Now thats what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga you awesome
Baby I dont play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum spend your whole life in the day
Whats down is a bet roll the dice
Yeah yeah so lets play
So what you went gold and rock a Rollie with the ice bezel
Its gon take a lot mo to see my level
Where Im at your check you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
Im a Benz bubble cat leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin Its not a game
Gleamin from ear to ear wrist to wrist ring and chain
Even me and JayZ got it locked crazy

Chorus Jermaine Dupri and JayZ
In the Ferrari or Jaguar switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out money aint a thang
Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked holler back money aint a thang
Jigga I dont like it if it dont gleam clean
And to hell with the price cause the money aint a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs thats locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks new whips money aint a thang
Yall wanna floss with us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin turn it up
See the money aint a thang

Intro JayZ
Yeah I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you reading the credits right now
If you in your car I dont care if its winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out buckle up lets go

Verse JayZ
Hello its Hova thats right youngun the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us the album is here
Before we get into the shit lets get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation
Theres Seven Degrees of Separation and Im Kevin Bacon
This is the murderers version
Jigga the shit even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God I should be rapping with a turban
Haters cant disturb him waiters cant serve him
Mike Jordan of rap outside Jay working
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I dont like playing niggas cant stick me
Niggas can not jam me niggas cant get me
Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe Its Hova the God

Outro Pain In Da Ass
Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG whatd he say if he was here
Hed say Jay whats it about Whats life about
If you dont go through as a mans a man
Hed say Suck it up take the fall do the time
Thats what makes you who you are makes you what you are
How many years you been around this thing of ours
Commission 125 years
Whats it about
Its about rules parameters
You take the beating for the friend you dont lay down
You dont betray who you are what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj Chill Ran Emory
They dont roar they dont rap
You know why Thats the rules you dont break them
You was born to be something I wasnt even supposed to be humble
Okay so you humble me now what you got
You got a war you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
Theres no rules theres no parameters theres no feelings
Theres no feelings for this game
So five ten years from now
Youre gonna wish there was American Commission
Five ten years from now
Theyre gonna miss JayZ
Okay Im reloaded

MTV in New York City for the first day in the trial of
Jay Im gone car speeds off
MTV the State vs Shawn Carter aka JayZ
Jay Uhh uhhuhuh uhh uhhuhuh uhh
MTV Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide

Verse 1
Ayo stand forward fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin the track
Testify til me spillin the smack
Now they got me for traffickin racketeerin audio crack
They call me Dope Man Dope Man
I try to tell em Im where hope floats man
Ghetto spokesman
A broke man approachin the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin from ninetysix
They say the world aint recovered from his fix
While they was usin cut I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday the jury got they brow raised
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A Reasonable Doubt
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out

MTV You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the Trial of the Century

Hook
They call me Dope Man Dope Man
I try to tell em Im where hope floats man
Ghetto spokesman

Verse 2
How come you label your brand of dope
Volume 1 and spread it through the slums
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called Volume 2
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as RocaFella in charge of his meteoric rise
And do you deny youre responsible for the demise
Of record execs and do you object
Your distributions Polygram and through your connects
Def Jam you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention your cohorts and henchmen
Dame Biggs Lyor Kev and Russell Simmons
And we aint gon talk about Murder Inc
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link

MTV The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelming amount of evidence
The DAs presented things arent looking good

Hook
They call me Dope Man Dope Man
I try to tell em Im where hope floats man
Ghetto spokesman

MTV Despite the grim outlook at this point
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity

Hook
They call me Dope Man Dope Man
I try to tell em Im where hope floats man
Ghetto spokesman

MTV JayZ is taking the stand

Verse 3
Right hand on the Bible left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word made sure my throat was clear
Ahem Im a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga I couldnt much work with my hands
But my mind was strong I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin goin backwards
At age nine saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it at a early age Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor I no longer kill my people I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time

MTV While the jury is inside deliberating
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation

Hook
They call me Dope Man Dope Man
I try to tell em Im where hope floats man
Ghetto spokesman

MTV Well the verdict has just been announced NOT GUILTY
It is complete pandemonium out here Hook Serena keeps speaking
People are cheering and hugging  there he is
JayZ is exiting the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him pop bulbs flashing
And people are just rushing up to him
Lets try and make our way over there JayZ JayZ
sounds of cameras keep flashing music fades

Verse 1 JayZ
You know the flow sicka know Jigga mo sicka now right
You know what me and Swizzs shit sound like
Crazed and demonic uh without blazin chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin stoop raised me
Ringin in da hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold its the new and improved JayZ
Let me explain this to you baby
I spent nights out days in
Niggas was blazing twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up
They postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist
Waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow baby

Hook Mariah  JayZ
Its the things that you do

Come on inhale exhale breathe on it for me

Verse 2 JayZ
You know I move like an ounce
Bottled up like crack
Thats how I make you bounce like that
Defy Websters words they cant pronounce like that
Thats why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap trap of my life
Flashback kill niggas
Rap skills unmatched Jigga man baby
I cant entertain it sometimes I cant explain it
God given guess it was all for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allahs wisdom
Couldve been lost in the system
Instead Im involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement come on

Hook Mariah  JayZ

Verse 3 JayZ
You know Ive traveled through zones
Homes spazzed like a bad back
I came into this game on Jazs back
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom thats that
Yeah Im here to show and prove
Dont matter to me the Garden or flowin on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do  its alright with me
Whether you big or bossy jig or flossy
Dusty or musty sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
Imma keep doing me unfortunately
I make the club rock make thugs pop guns
Make old folks do the bus stop cant stop son
Shit I give you whats hot and whats not I never knew
Yall niggas know niggas how niggas do

Chorus

Verse 2 JayZ Amil

Verses tight hooks harder than Ken Norton

So I have no problem coming around the old way
Sluggin you thats what a thug will do
Thuggin bust techs a suspect dangerous and I love rough sex

Paranoid like Sunny drive backing up
But Im from BedStuy killa with the flow
Let lead fly from out the fourfour motherfuckers

Chorus

Bridge JayZ

And I burn whoever come in my chambers of torture
The flame gon spark ya
Blood stain the tarp

Verse 3 Amil JayZ
You got nothing to offer
But the baby nine
And make ya fine offer
The chick is ill
Even with fourinch heels
No panties on and Patricia Fields

Just name the time the place
We could take it back to Vaseline on our face
On a regular day we just gleam up your space
Rock our own line got our whole team laced
RW with the torch on my jeans by the waist
Without heat we still gon steam up the place
Amillion Jigga man flawless here we go

Look in the air say a prayer hail mary hopin God forgave him
Cop liquor twist it tap it twice pour it to the pavement
We live dangerous often findin ourself in the eyes of strangers
Who the fuck is you My dream is big and in it my team is rich
As seen through the eyes of a nigga who aint seen shit

I gotta do Shawn cause even when JayZ was lukewarm
I was gettin my loot on nigga Im too strong
Eat til the foods gone they placed me on this earth
The twin brother of Rich Porter seperated at birth
I got the soul of a hustler quiet noise like a muffler
Fuck with us walk through the ghetto

Travel with me through my deep thoughts
Yall cant learn Jigga by the shit yall be readin in The Source

At sixteen in the 600 unlicensed driver
Playin cops and robbers like shots cant stop us
Flippin a bird to the choppers fuck you coppers
Buckthirty on the turns
Reckless abandon when Im standin on this pedal
Hand on my metal minus all this time they tryin to give me
Lord help me all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or
Somebody to tell me that they felt me
I tried to play the hand you dealt me
But you gave me five funnies an shit

Nothin less than a 520 and with that said

And if they did all they said was where dem dollaz at
Imagine bein skinny growin up around brolic cats
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start popping back

Tryin to give you big numbers you got math to do
Tryin to make you miss summer shit that aint cool

Up against the wall tryin to pass through

Skully tilted pants saggin damn near touchin the floor

RocAFella Ruff Ryders niggas scared of that
Got a new motto this year Dont Fuck With My Ones
Knock on your door three in the mornin
Its just us and the guns
See I scrambled with priests hustle with nuns
I got the mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy
Niggas get fly let em defy gravity
Fofive rapidly lift your chest cavity
Streets wont let me chill
Always been a clumsy nigga dont let me spill
Muhfuckers wanna wet me still I remain yall
Raw the one like five divided by four
Shit this just the hate thats been provided by yall
Reciprocated and multiplied by more
You likely to see Jigga in a widebody or
Droptop Bentley Azure holla at me yall

Chorus JayZ  Amil

Verse 3 JayZ
I dont give a fuck if I sold one or one million but I think you should
Cause if I only sold one then out comes the hood
All black in the club the outcome aint good
Them niggas act like wolves how come They could
Cause we dont drop hits we drop bombs that smash
Til the wrists is lit up the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let em call me Shawn they glad
Let me sit up in they whip til I launch it back
Snap they neck then shoot em til they arch them back
The calmest cat trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind body and soul push your conscience back
Monsters back and Flex drop a bomb to that
And erybody singalong to the track cmon
Uhhuh uhh uhh

Hook 2X Mashonda JayZ
Cmon here baby you drive me crazy where all my baby thugs
Dont want nobody but you my baby and all my ladies sing
Hold me tight and call me your lady say it louder
Make me scream your name

Verse 1
I took ya outta Jacobs in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down thats right
It took shortsleeves and loungin to understand
The reason they call you ice everybody freeze
Aint a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
Cause you belong to me now sing ya song for me
Cmon

Hook 2X

Verse 2
Im often with you so they wonder bout the juice I got
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
From the bottom to the top
The skateboard to the drop
From the nada to the Prada
I got ya like I got ya
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went youd follow
Soon I spent every dollar you became my habit
Other brothers vice was smoke mines was carats
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
The rocks got bigger watch face got blue
Tricked a little bit shit I lace my boo
Fuck it my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice like deja vu
If they ever met in the mall its over yall
Just the way I do and either way you win
I mean the thugs love ya when youre girls best friend

Hook 2X

Verse 3
Yeah yeah yeah
In the wedding band you love in the gold chain you thug
Sometimes you given just because
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations
Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up
In the hands of gold diggers you never enough
Rings things just never enough
But me and you together gon shine to the end
I mean the thugs love ya but ya girls best friend

When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death
You gon ruin your rep
Trippin while we pimpin these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game dont stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Cant help it if shes in love with a ridah

For the roof over my head for my shoes for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
Strive for what you believe in set goals and you can achieve them
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezing
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldnt come back that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin down the household when times was bad
As a man I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasnt the life meant for you
Youre a queen you deserve the cream everything that gleamed

Intro
Wise man say wise man say
Wise man say
Youll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
Youll never figure out real love

Verse 1
Its so crazy crazycrazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life what does it feel like
I ask you tonight I ask you tonight
What does it feel like I ask you tonight
To live a real life

Hook
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say Kanye he keeps it real boy
Pinocchios story is I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchios story goes to be a real boy

Verse 2
Its funny
Pinocchio lied and thats what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
Its like Im lookin for something out there tryna find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina
For everybody that sees you that say Wheres my camera
For everybody that sees you to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

Hook
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchios story goes I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchios story goes

Verse 3
And there is no Gepetto to guide me
No one right beside me
The only one was behind me
I cant find her no more I cant call her no more
I cant
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to LA maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy chasin the American dream
Chasin everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when uh the Benz was left and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin the money that the
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy
They say Kanye you keep it too real boy
Perspective and wise man say
One day youll find your way
The wise man say youll find your way
The wise man say youll find your way
Wise man say

That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out her parentsll look at her funny
Now tell me that aint insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr
She like Fuck it Ill just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs cause her baby daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like Nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper look how low well stoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coupe

Drug dealer buy Jordan crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I aint even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it I went to Jacob with 25 thou

Verse 1 Kanye West
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye
Lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smoking sign
With a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle you cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude lock yourself in a room
Doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers
Thats A Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship

Verse 2 GLC
And I didnt even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time
Thirsty on the grind Chi state of mind
Lost my momma lost my mind
Life my love thats not mine
Why you aint signed Wasnt my time
Leave me alone work for yall
Half of its yours half of its mine
Only one to ball never one to fall
Got to get mine got to take mine
Got a Tec9 reach my prime
Got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at Ye hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet sound so sweet
Yes Im the same ol G same goatee staying low key nope
Holler at God Man whyd you have to take my folks
Hope to see Freddie G Yusef G love my G
Rolly G police watch me smoke my weed count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me
And Im just trying to find my peace
Shouldve finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldnt use my piece blaow
Aww man this pressure

Verse 3 Consequence
I remember having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Trying to make this thing right
And having one of my coworkers say Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night
Well easy come easy go how that saying goes
No more broad service cars and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me
ARs and they faculties all turn their back on me
And didnt want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
Cause nothings there nothings fair
I dont want to ever go back there
So I wont be taking no days off til my spaceship takes off

Hook
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit

Verse 1
You know what the Midwest is Young and restless
Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace
And next these niggas might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless gasps
Try to catch it gasps its kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be askin us questions harass and arrest us
Sayin We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
Huh Yall eat pieces of shit Whats the basis
We aint going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But Ill be gone til November I got packs to move
I hope

Chorus
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devils tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now
Jesus walk
And I dont think theres nothin I can do now to right my wrongs

Jesus walks for them
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we dont think
I aint here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out

Chorus
Jesus walk
God show me the way because the Devils tryna break me down
Jesus walk with me
The only thing that I pray is that my feet dont fail me now

Yo first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear now I have they heart
Rappers came and went Ive been here from the start
I seen them put it together watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons

So when I reload he holds number one position
When you hot Im hot
And when your feet cold mines is sizzling
Its plain to see niggas cant fuck with me
cause Imma be that nigga for life
This is not an image this is God given
This is hard livin mixed with Cristal sippin

Verse 2 Kanye West
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Thats why I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

Verse 3 J Ivy
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You dont need a curriculum to know that youre a part of the math
Cats think Im delirious but Im so damn serious
Thats why I expose my soul to the globe the world
Im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
Im not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this thats why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So its not me its He thats lyrical
Im not a miracle Im a heavensent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
Thats why Im instrumental vibrations is what Im into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that aint what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
Im trying to get us us free like Cinque
I cant stop thats why Im hot
Determination dedication motivation
Im talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I cant let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that Gods penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
Thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess Im one of a kind in a full house
Cause whenever I open my heart my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take em to church

WHITE its getting late mami

Ayo aint you meet that chick at that conference with your moms
And sisters the bomb boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyway I dont usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette

If she think its fly she aint met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate

Verse 4 Common
Get em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke a hype filled with dope
Yall assumed I was doomed out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to but still got love
Thats why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs its like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called Soul Survivor
I stole on liveer niggas than you
Yous a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me
They say HipHop is dead Im here to resurrect me
Marshas too sexy to even make songs like these
Thats why the raw dont know your name like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins nobody got to coppin a
Album how come you the hot garbage of
The years clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up tellin you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster chimped up
With a pimp cup illiterate nigga read the infra
Red across your head Im bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver I aint a Madd Rapper
Just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey I did this my way
So when the industry crash I survive like Kanye
Spittin through wires and fires emcees retirin
Got your hands up get them motherfuckers higher then

Verse 1 Kanye West
Golly more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to pologize to Mos and Kweli probably
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain Carti lens and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again
And its still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon more chips than Pentium
Whatcha gon buy next Whatever new trend it is

Verse 2 Kanye West
Now even though I went to college
And dropped out of school quick

Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
And givin head is like a whale thats usin a toothpick
Well Im in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free99
Later on I might charge for mnage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it aint gon cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And Im still actin calm denamuhh she asked
Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was
While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand let me help you with a plan
While he trickin off dont get no rich nigga

Verse 3 Kanye West

In the four dot six bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or til I go crash
Whatever comes first Im prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second Ill be there with my weapon
Pullin up in the Lexuses one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin me messages
K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed drink and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam
So say my name like Candyman
And Imma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
You cant take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

And youll spend all your money on crack cocaine
But itll be YOUR money
No more borrowing from mom for my high

Cause youre so excited about it
If you continue to work at the Gap after several interviews oh my God
Youll come in at a entrylevel position
And when you do that
If you kiss enough ass
Youll move up to the next level
Which is being the secretarys secretary
And boy is that great

And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time

And look you tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business

But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Interlude
Rain rain rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain rain rain go away

A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
The second she storm out then he storm in
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt
We aint letting everybody in our family business

Heres to RocAFella
Raise your glasses your glasses your glasses to the sky and
Heres to the Roc
This is the last call for alcohol for the
Mr Rockefeller
So get your ass up off the wall

Verse 1 Kanye West
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me 10 seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Hook Kanye West
Now I am
Heres to the Roc
And they ask me they ask me they ask me I tell them
Heres to RocAFella
Raise your glasses your glasses your glasses to the sky and
Heres to the Roc
This is the last call for alcohol for the
Mr Rockefeller
So get your ass up off the wall

Verse 2 Kanye West
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him  ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20000 people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips

Hook Kanye West

So this AR over at RocAFella named Hip Hop Picked the Truth beat for Beanie And I was in the session with him I had my demo with me You know like I always do I play the songs hes like Who that spittin Im like Its me Hes like Oh well okay
Uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth
Just askin me to send him beats and Im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with

So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you
So wont you raise your glass wont you

And um he was friends with my mentor No ID And No ID told him Look man you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap

No ID Yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap

Saxophone Solo

I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

Hiphop Ill sign you as a producer and a rapper

Im like oh shit I was messin with uh DDot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off layaway get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time And really I just like bit the drums off Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on This Cant be Life

And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said Oh you a real soulful dude

JayZ Oh you a real soulful dude man

And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said

JayZ Check this out tell me what you think of this right here

Tell me what you think of this And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion So he asked me What you think of it

JayZ so what you think of this

And I was like Man that shit tight you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a UHaul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to

Hiphop No I think Jay gon like this one right here

And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that Gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like Yo whats up Im Kanye

JayZ That that was cool That was hot

Like the chorus went Dont bite that chorus I might still use it So I play that song for him and hes like oh shit

Dame Oh shit its not even wack

I aint gonna front its kinda hot

Dame its actually kinda hot

Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like yo man B B you dont want a brick you dont want a brick

Dame you dont wanna catch a brick

You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all oh word Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producer rapper and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol and right the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do Man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said yo Capitol pulled on the deal

Mel Yo Capitol pulled out on the deal

And you know I told them that RocAFella was interested and I dont know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever I went up I called G I said man you think we could still get that deal with RocAFella

Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you

Verse 1 Raekwon
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet a dons regret
Never to walk miles for love I sit in the starters deck
It just happened I was floating you seen the captain
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two stop in Diego
Its obvious I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she cant Clyde Bonnie this
Fly walls dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there thats why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater Audi leather
Playing the field trying to outslick Baretta

Verse 2 Justin Bieber
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where shes going Thats what nobody knows

Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said Yo whats your occupation crazy rhyming

Stunting in a hightop Louis shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wallys something that caught me
Im telling you what WuTang taught me
The young youth rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summers blazing
Then say You looking good fly colored Asian
Raw I give it to you no trivia
She used to roll with my GUnit like Olivia
Til she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess thats the day she became a runaway love

Chorus Justin Bieber
Im running out of time where is my runaway love
Searching low and high know that Im not letting up
Id give it all up for us but itll never be enough

Chilling with two of my brothers we both live
On deck grabbing em on set
This is how we roll in the business she a go Ima go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch the videotapes even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost I know Im going crazy I cant floss
Me my lady left my homies its all bologna
Just like rocking the old Ponys
So when Im chilling Im just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didnt mind come on

Chorus Justin Bieber
Im running out of time where is my runaway love
Searching low and high know that Im not letting up
Id give it all up for us but itll never be enough
I wont stop until I find my runaway love

Searching low and high know that Im not letting up
Id give it all up for us but itll never be enough

Verse 1 Kanye West
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime

Chorus Kanye West
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin you my sensation
I know Im preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan Satan Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We aint married but tonight I need some consummation

Verse 2 Kanye West
When the sun go down its the magic hour the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
Thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface could it be more Tony
You love me for me Could you be more phony

Chorus Kanye West
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin you my sensation
Havent said a word Havent said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue

Instrumental Interlude Mike Dean Guitar Solo

Verse 3 Rick Ross
Lookin at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin at my wrist itll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine sipping Ros all alone
Doubleheaded monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot excess is just my character
All black tux nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lords ladder
We still speeding running signs like they dont matter
Uh hater talking never made me mad
Never that when Im in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool Im a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin so its on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County Jacksonville rep Melbourne
Whole cliques appetite had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga red Coogi sweater dice roller
Im making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble retracing my steps

Money drive you crazy look at Marburys handle
Vaseline face reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job something like Breyers
Euro tank top Diorinspired
Sell it to you hard no assembly required
Yuugh in 2012 in 2010

A nigga suited fresh like Im headed to the ball
MC hunting season putting heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess thats why in school my grades went from As to Bs to Cs
All over double Ds I be absent all week
This is for my niggas all the ones I ride for
Man thats the fam we let em in through the side door
Hold on thats the girl you gave a wedding ring
Man me and my niggas nutted on her everything

Intro Mos Def  Swizz Beatz
Yeah yeah there it go there it us
This is something special uhhuh yeah
This is something new its an amazing time
This is something special look around
This is something new the power of observation

Verse 1 Mos Def
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes properties disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet what must they give away
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay
Surprise its your life its your business anyway
So please pardon these and such curious minds
Peace safe passage precious time hither and gone
The day of days Yawm alQiymah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large many more
To make our largest star show small furthermore
The end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isnt all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion expansion the order of the random
See the dreamers see the sleepers
Whyd you wake them Sweet Jesus
And life on Earth seek heaven first
Lets put in this work

Chorus Charlie Wilson  Swizz Beatz
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Lord Lord this is something special
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord this is something new
Lord Lord this is something special
Lord

Verse 2 Kanye West
Her heels set the mood where did you acquire those Alaas
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now thats nuts
I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks we aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they shoulda never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies
Booby trap holla back

Chorus Charlie Wilson  Swizz Beatz

All white Bentley I call that mama
My life crazy like Obamas

All black Carbon on my wrist yeah
Its gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP well they thank me
And I be mad too if you aint me
Call me Mr Dean or Mr Boss
See me riding clean in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny thats old money
Niggas looking crazy but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers they like bloggers
You see me Im a bank hogger
Coming through your hood in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck
100 feet and better what the fuck you stick
Paparazzi on the water with the fuckyou stick
My face got the fuck you pricks
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede nigga in the damn rain
Aint a damn thing money aint a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos we do the goddamn thing

Chorus Charlie Wilson  Swizz Beatz

Verse 4 Raekwon
Aiyyo open glass on my fingers I sit back like Im caged
But still caking my niggas is hating
Its like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak Id rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger stones they throw
Thats why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you dont know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine nonbelievers no game
Im zooted down rolling a spliff maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction Im sun hes attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends counting currency hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble grab the 4
Hope it aint the law or maybe some nigga trying to score

Verse 1 Kanye West
Im so appalled Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from yall
Baby youre fired your girlfriend hired
But if you dont mind Ima keep you on call
We above the law we dont give a fuck about yall
I got dogs thatll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers I need more rubbers
And if I dont use rubbers need more covers
Housekeeping I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get Os like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke voila
Praises due to the most high Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada
Baby Im magic tada
Address me as your highness high as United
30000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit man they out of work
Thats why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
Thats why Id rather spit something that got a purp

Verse 2 JayZ
How should I begin this Im just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners
Im so appalled I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
Im fresher than you all so I dont have to pause
All of yall can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know Im more focused
I lost thirty mil so I spent another thirty
Cause unlike Hammer thirty million cant hurt me
Fucking insane the fuck am I saying
Not only am I fly Im fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges fucking ridiculous

Hook CyHi

Verse 3 Pusha T
Success is what you make it take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where Im from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I become
CNN said Id be dead by twentyone
Blackjack I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream motherfuckers Im watching it take shape
While to you Im just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove leather roof love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like Im in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a bakers dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasnt
I keep the citys best never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too it dont affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didnt need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind Im still under the watchful
Eye of the law aspire for more
Them kilos came we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws aint flaws when its you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it I own you all yeah

Refrain Swizz Beatz

Verse 4 CyHi The Prynce
Hah I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod Id be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite hah my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy damn its hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment Thou shalt not hate kid
My movement is like the civil rights Im Ralph David
Abernathy so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas baby those are marks
I met this girl on Valentines Day fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to march
Hah damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos nigga Noahs ark
I got a seven on me I call my dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket Matt Leinart
GAT in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Yall just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods dont make me grab iron

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Heads in the sky wings raised and
Shes about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars when she leaves the ground
Shell see a broken heart if she turns around
But aint no going back this is how it must be
He told her shell be burned alive she just told him Trust me
If funerals are beautiful this ugly
Knowing this he told her You wont leave me if you love me
And he knows that because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings as it engulfs her
Now shes a bright blaze light rays
A shooting out a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So lets hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the neverend
One closed chapter it opens up another part
So this is more like The end question mark

Hook Mos Def
Dont look down its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle whatever you do

Verse 2 Kanye West
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom I woulda been the best Ye

Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years huh
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back wish love came with a couple receipts
Man our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip lets make it a couples retreat
Do it How could my girl do this to me
Woke up to a note saying The world did this to me
Now Im testing onetwo reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One two three four five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they lying in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling
As hearing your Seans you know I love you
Shedding tears everyday I know you do
And Im tired of lying in these puddles
I ask Why sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out so I could see you smile
II know you can see me now

Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will

On some math class shit so check the young genius out
Fuck the world bust a nut and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin bout

Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse

Verse 3 Talib Kweli
Some wear a suit and tie they dont wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy stop in that traffic coppers harass us
Then DA attack us want us in chains like BA Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion being antiestablishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It aint lookin good for you if youre a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me nobodys scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers I debate scholars
Question do it gotta make sense if it make dollars
Sick visions is living inside of brains
Its like we sadomasochistic addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively quite literally clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it dont buy the chain if you cant afford it
Ye them lonelyidled whores by the boards
Trust

Verse 4 Consequence
That old ballandchain had me chained up for weeks
So of course Im off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the games over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude shes saying that can stay over
Should be a chain who goes by the name of Choker
Thats what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door Im on the way over
Now when I came over his only response
Was You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
Cause Imma eat your food for that chain that I wore
Cause you be running round like the chain make the man
So its obvious the he dont know the chain of command
Cause my chain commands that kind of respect
And its so chunky that its a pain in the neck
But it came with a check I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
Them chain snatchers are hoping that you aint ready
So dont get distracted keep your aim steady
Or therell be a chain reaction since my chains heavy

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

Verse 1
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right
Aight

Hook
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

Verse 2
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means

Hook
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

Verse 3
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams

Now everything Im not made me everything I am
Damn here we go again
People talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
Everything Im not made me everything I am

Verse 1
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like william
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am

And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos

So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
Theyd rather give me the Nnigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tore em off
And make em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown in
The nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me

She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home

Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud

Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by

Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espaol No way Jos
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse

Bridge
My big brother was BIGs brother
So heres a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell em
A idol in my eyes god of the game
Heart of the City RocaFella chain
Never be the same never be another
Number one Young Hov also my big brother

Hook
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor and thats where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit

Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow no goodbyes

Verse 1 Kanye West
See what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before thats what the virgin says
Weve been generally warned thats what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man big pimpin like Jigga man

I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy uh its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hoes will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars  I know it

Verse 2
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now

Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im goin on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets

Verse 1 Kanye West
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin sixteen he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie

The candy gloss is immaculate its simply amazing
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy Lac
Trunk open screens on neons lit with fifth relaxed
Im on a mission for dimepieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
Its a starstudded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling You see them screens falling
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates Im ballin
Im leaning on the switch sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin something candy coated crawling like a caterpillar

And that dont make no sense but baby Im the shit
And everything I flip you know its something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby its evident
You see a player flicking and how you aint convinced
That you should go on and kiss it just a lil bit just a lil bit
I got my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin through my angel wings
They see me hoes actin like they seen a king

Yeah
They say home is where the hate is my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution aint a game its another name for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Dont he know he could only get as high as he fell
Show money becomes bail relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale Behold the Pale  Horse
Got me trapped like R Kel I bail and it 

Outro Gil ScottHeron
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again

I know its past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers
The doctor dont wanna take procedures
He claim her heart cant take the anaesthesia
Itll send her body into a seizure
That lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
Hey chick Im at a loss for words
What do you say at this time Remember when I was 9
Tell her everything gon be fine but I be lyin
Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin
Im arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandmas in the NBA
Right now shed be okay But since she
Was just a secretary worked for the church for 35 years
Things sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together hes strong
Thats where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse Did you do the research
She asked me Can you sign some tshirts
Bitch is you smokin reefer
You dont see that we hurt But still

Let me see the Xrays I aint no expert Im just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley Aunt Beverly Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie its just One Thing
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a alltime high
To get there we run we fly we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers were the roses

Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say Yo no hablo ingls
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself

Made a mil myself and Im still myself

Intro Shirley Bassey
Diamonds are forever
Theyre all I need to please me
They cant stimulate or tease me
They wont leave in the night
Have no fear that they might desert me

Hook Kanye West  Shirley Bassey sample
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever

Verse 1 Kanye West
Good mornin this aint Vietnam still
People lose hands legs arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I aint talkin about the ones that be glowin
Im talkin about RocaFella my home
My chain these aint conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob Dont lie to me man
See a part of me sayin keep shinin
How when I know what a blood diamond is
Though its thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here its a drug trade we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds the chains the bracelets the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And heres the conflict
Its in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin to get that ice
On a Polo rugby it looks so nice
How can somethin so wrong make me feel so right
Right Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your RocaFella diamond tonight

Hook Kanye West  Shirley Bassey sample
Diamonds are forever forever forever
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever forever forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever Forever ever Ever ever
Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever Ever ever

Verse 2 Kanye West
People askin me is Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dawg Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
Whats up with you and Jay man Are yall okay man

Verse 3 JayZ
Yup I got it from here Ye damn
The chain remains the gang is intact
The name is mine Ill take blame for that
The pressures on but guess who aint gonna crack
Ha ha pardon me I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when youre the Rock of Gibraltar
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This aint no tall order this is nothin to me
Difficult takes a day impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke Im guessin I can sell CDs
Im not a businessman Im a business man
Let me handle my business damn
Kanyeez you got me Freeway then Foxy
YGs Teairra Mari Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as Im alive hes a millionaire
And even if I die hes in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah he dont even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes
Shirley Basseys in the rear
Sayin exactly what Ive been sayin practically my whole career
The diamond is forever Ive been minin this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Dons timin couldnt be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If youre waitin for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up
Get they first car and then IRS show up

Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather

I heard the beat and I aint know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice
Fofos or Black Christ Both flowsd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like should I freestyle or write
He said Nas what the fans want is Illmatic still
Looked at the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now Im a free agent and Im thinkin its time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So yall copped the LPs and yall fiends got dealt
Im Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

Verse 1
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Ima love you til you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Ima get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama

Chorus
Hey Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you
Let me tell you what Im about to do

Verse 2
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama

Chorus
Hey Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Ima get you a Jag whatever else you want

Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama

Chorus
I wanna scream so loud for you cause Im so proud of you

Verse 4 Consequence
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pals gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess its only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what couldve gone wrong
Now they asking Cons how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now I shouldve gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind cause Ida gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times cause Im gone

Verse 5 Kanye West
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1999
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone

Does he write his own rhymes Well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talkin about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Spoil yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porsche and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man

I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at

I know its late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah

Verse 1 Kanye West
Uh uh lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I dont wanna have to check you
Im Chi as BuckFiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid
McDonalds with the flow served over over a billion
Youve seen the video words over the building
Uh I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when the Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

Verse 2 Common
Uh yeah uh yeah uhuh uhuh
I open my eyes the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized the black enterprise the passion arise
The youth fantasize who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies mamas askin rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if its a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised
On the corner

Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover

Aint no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me

I will never ever let you live this down down down
Not for nothing Ive foreseen it I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down down down

Verse 1 Kanye West
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with 30 rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it

Verse 2 Kanye West
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip set I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls

Verse 4 Raekwon
I done copped Timbs lived in lenses kid
Armani suits fresh fruits Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up smoking one cuff
Live as a red Jag a Louis bag grabbing a blunt fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one Ls
Kites off to jails buying sweats running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes throwing dice for decimals
The older head bolder head would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
That meant code red bent off the black skunk
The black dutch back of the old shed
If you cant live you dying you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving keep grinding
Keep shining to every young man this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Outro Kid Cudi
Not for nothing Ive forseen it I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down down down

Im living in that 21st Century doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking I just count the hours
Stop tripping Im tripping off the power
21stCentury schizoid man
The system broken the school is closed the prisons open
We aint got nothing to lose motherfucker we rolling
Huh Motherfucker we rolling
With some lightskinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world Ill see you in the morning
Huh Ill see you in the morning
This is way too much I need a moment

My furs is Mongolian my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows hes so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece

Chorus
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clocks ticking I just count the hours
Stop tripping Im tripping off the powder
Till then fuck that the worlds ours
And they say and they say

Verse 1 Kanye West
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more

Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime

Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat

Lookin at my wrist itll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine sipping Ros all alone
Doubleheaded monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot excess is just my character
All black tux nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the Lords ladder
We still speeding running signs like they dont matter
Uh hater talking never made me mad
Never that when Im in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool Im a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin so its on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County Jacksonville rep Melbourne
Whole cliques appetite had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga red Coogi sweater dice roller
Im making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings never stumble retracing my steps

You cant blame em they aint never seen Versace sofas
Every bag every blouse every bracelet
Comes with a price tag baby face it
You should leave if you cant accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the ballanigga matrix
Invisibly set the Rolex is faceless
Im just young rich and tasteless

Verse 3 Kanye West
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave

Chorus Kanye West
And I always find yeah I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
Im so gifted at finding what I dont like the most
So I think its time for us to have a toast
Lets have a toast for the douchebags
Lets have a toast for the assholes
Lets have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Lets have a toast for the jerkoffs
Thatll never take work off
Baby I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Verse 1 Kanye West
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah

Whose fault

Chorus John Legend
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure

Verse 1 John Legend
Ill call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong

Chorus John Legend
But I love to play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure

Verse 2 Kanye West
On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

Chorus John Legend
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more

Verse 3 Kanye West
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
1AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

Chorus John Legend
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure

Interlude Kanye West
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely  Chloe Mitchell

Chorus Kanye West
Lets play the blame game I love you more
Lets play the blame game for sure
Lets call out names names I hate you more
Lets call out names names for sure

Bridge Kanye West
I cant love you this much I cant love you this much

I cant love you this much I cant love you this much

Outro Kanye West
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing

Verse Gil ScottHeron
Us living as we do upsidedown
And the new word to have is revolution
People dont even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because Gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom freeDOOM
Democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded the bubblin bubblin bubblin bubblin bubblin
In the mother countrys crotch
What does Webster say about soul
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done build a new route to China if theyll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA

Pour the champagne let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now Im in the Louvre lookin for fossils
Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic 32
Lyrically cant none of yall murder Ye
Cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality

You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good hes been to me
I dont know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because hes done so much for me 

Every morning
Every day of my life
I wont always be crying tears
In the middle of the night and I wont always have to wake up
By myself wondering how Im gonna get through the day
I wont always have to think about what Im gonna do
And how Im gonna how Im gonna make it
How Im gonna get there because he
Hes gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I wont always be crying these tears
I wont always be feeling so blue
Some day he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I dont know if anybody understands what that feels like

No matter what youve been through
Or where youve been hes always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldnt do it without him I wouldnt want to
Im crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life

I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

Fuck the church up by drinkin at the communion

Who your real friends We all came from the bottom
Im always blamin you but whats sad you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her shit I thought it was Thursday

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar  Kanye West
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the Kman
She remember my Sprinter said I was in the grape van
Uhmwell cutieI like your bougie booty
Come ErykahBadumewell lets make a movie
Hell you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now its Dennys 4 in the morning spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction middle finger pedestrians
RB singers and lesbians rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you its damaging for you I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math
That shit dont add up youre making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an Alist rapper
I said baby spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
Youre dealing with malpractice dont kill a good niggas confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you dont know what a condom is
The head still good though the head still good though
Make me say Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles Buddhist monks and Capn Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service head service I came in first place
The opportunity the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released she was kickin in gratuity
And yeah G I was all for it
She said K Lamar you kind of dumb to be a poet
Ima put you on game for the lames that dont know theyre a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Chorus Kanye West
Scary scary
No more parties in LA
Please baby no more parties in LA

Verse 2 Kanye West
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds passenger seat somethin pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list I wasnt even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs somebody gon get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks man you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I cant fault em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she aint goin back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin
Of weak content and slow jammin
But dont worry this ones so jammin
You know it LA its so jammin
I be thinkin every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure the problem aint I be drivin
The problem is I be textin
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was bout their friend that just died
Textin and drivin down Mulholland Drive
Thats why Id rather take the 405
I be worried bout my daughter I be worried bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye I aint worried bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What Im supposed to do
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints
Every agent I know know I hate agents
Im too black Im too vocal Im too flagrant
Something smellin like shit thats the new fragrance
Its just me I do it my way bitch
Some days Im in my Yeezys some days Im in my Vans
If I knew yall made plans I wouldnt have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldnt rap like this again
But the writers block is over emcees cancel your plans
A 38yearold 8yearold with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I dont never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn got a bald fade I might slam
Pink fur got Nori dressin like Cam
Thank God for me
Whole family gettin money thank God for E
I love rockin jewelry a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when Im workin on my house
Tell em partys in here we dont need to go out
We need the turbo thots high speed turbo thots
Dropdrodrodrodrop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach good dickll do that
She keep pushin me back good dickll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dickll put your ass to sleep
Get money money money money
Big big money money money money
And as far as real friends tell all my cousins I love em
Even the one that stole the laptop you dirty motherfucker

Intro Kanye West
Yeah 908 LA time
Back in the lab and shit

Verse 1 Kanye West
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with no permission on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past 25

Chorus Sampha
Yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
Wonderin whether Gods gonna say hi
Oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
Father Father Father in the night sky
Wonderin whether Gods gonna say hi
Yeah I feel like Im home yeah yeah

Verse 2 Kanye West
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my selfesteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know He got a plan I know Im on Your beams
One set of footsteps You was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps You was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo
Modernday MJ with a offthewall flow

Bridge Sampha
Nightlife walk all over me
Walk all over me
Im deliverin everything Ive ever sent that youll bring
Fly fly fly overseas

Oh anywhere everything but in between

Wonderin whether Gods gonna say hi
Oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
Wonderin whether Gods gonna say hi
Father Father Father in the night sky
Oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Verse 3 Sampha
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin before you leave
Youve been treatin me like Im invisible now Im visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I cant quite understand the games you play
Understand understand understand Im standin under oath
And I promised I I wouldnt fall anymore
But Im cryin at the bar
Im wishin that you saw my scars man
Im wishin that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I dont know anyone except the night sky above

Chorus Sampha
Yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
Wonderin whether Gods gonna say hi
Oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky

Wonderin whether Gods gonna say hi
Oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

All in on that alimony uh yeahyeah she got you homie yeah

Intro Beenie Man
Relivin the past
Your loss

Verse 1 King Louie
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
MOB she call me selfish
Success got em jealous
Shortys killin while Im drillin
Tattoos how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin hard I got a name to prove
Killin em honey how I make the pain improve

Chorus King Louie
We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down

We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down

Verse 2 Kanye West
This the crayist shit in the club
Since In Da Club
Its so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguards back like Prince in the club
She say Can you get my friends in the club
I say Can you get my Benz in the club
If not treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside til the evenin end
When I go raw I like to leave it in
When I wake up I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again

Chorus King Louie
We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down
We can send this bitch up it can go down

I got hustle though ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this since one like this immaculate conception
I transform like this perform like this was Yeshuas new weapon
I dont contemplate I meditate then off your fuckin head
This that put the kids to bed
This that  I got I got I got I got realness
I just kill shit cause its in my DNA
I got millions I got riches buildin in my DNA
I got dark I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again then win again like Wimbledon I serve
Yeah thats him again the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work I know just who you are
See yous a yous a yous a bitch your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched heritage inside your DNA
Backbone dont exist born outside a jellyfish I gauge
See my pedigree most definitely dont tolerate the front
Shit Ive been through prolly offend you this is Paulas oldest son
I know murder conviction burners boosters burglars ballers dead redemption
Scholars fathers dead with kids and I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah yeah yeah yeah soldiers DNA
Born inside the beast my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9 on cell motel we didnt have nowhere to stay
At 29 Ive done so well hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like Im supposed to antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work and absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve and thats a riff gonna plead this case
The reason my powers here on Earth salute the truth when the prophet say

Interlude Kendrick Lamar

Livin on the go and sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin out the window
Baby in the pool Godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
Phone never on I dont conversate
I dont compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder these are the breaks
These are the times level number nine
Look up in the sky ten is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
Peace to the world let it rotate

Feel like Ima learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin aint mutual I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin of no hope
The feelin of bad dope a quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin the feelin of false freedom
Ill forcefeed em the poison that fill em up in the prison
I feel like its just me
Look I feel like I cant breathe look I feel like I cant sleep
Look I feel heartless often off this
Feelin of fallin of fallin apart with darkest hours lost it
Fillin the void of bein employed with ballin
Streets is talkin fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit internet blogs and pulpit fill em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin what Pac was
The feelin of an apocalypse happenin but nothin is awkward
The feelin wont prosper the feelin is toxic
I feel like Im boxin demons monsters
False prophets schemin sponsors industry promises
Niggas bitches honkies crackers Compton
Church religion token blacks and bondage
Lawsuit visits subpoena served in concert
FUCK your feelings I mean this for imposters
I can feel it the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin I feel like take somethin
I feel like skatin off I feel like waitin for em
Maybe its too late for em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for em

The better part the human heart you love em or dissect em
Happiness or flashiness How do you serve the question
See in the perfect world I would be perfect world
I dont trust people enough beyond they surface world
I dont love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics hopin I make amend
I understand I aint perfect I probably wont come around
This time I might put you down last time I aint give a fuck I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb youre dealin with cold thumb

Kendrick Lamar
Now in a perfect world I probably wont be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldnt blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
I know the walls they can listen I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See in a perfect world Ill choose faith over riches
Ill choose work over bitches Ill make schools out of prison
Ill take all the religions and put em all in one service
Just to tell em we aint shit but Hes been perfect world

Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Hop in the shower put on your makeup lace your weave up
Touch on yourself call up your nigga tell him he aint shit

Hop on the Gram flex on the bitches that be hatin on you
Pop you a pill call up your bitches have em waitin on you
Go to the club have you some fun make that ass bounce

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I wake in the mornin my head spinnin from the last night
Both in the trance feelings are dead what a fast life
Manager called the lobby called its 1130
Did this before promised myself Id be a hour early
Room full of clothes bag full of money call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry 100K I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin for confirmation hopin election wasnt true
All of us worried all of us buried and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal make us feel cheap
Still and sad distraught and mad tell the neighbor bout it
Bet they agree parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin things change
Revertin back to our daily programs stuck in our ways
Lust

Interlude Kendrick Lamar
Lately I feel like I been lustin over the fame
Lately we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately lately lately my lust been hidin lately

Brace yourself lust is all yours

Yesterday I got a call like from my dawg like 101

He was sobbin he was mobbin way belligerent and drunk
Talkin out his head philosphin on what the Lord had done
He said KDot can you pray for me Its been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
He was lookin for some closure hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do no better but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin killed
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like Bitch I did that
Aint no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace dont you fuck with one of ours

Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece touch my nephew touch my brother

Until you finally get the memo you will always feel that way

Ill prolly die from witnesses leavin me falsed accused
Ill prolly die from thinkin that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin the line actin too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
Ill prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint my bones snappin
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein too laxed 
Or die from waitin on it die cause Im movin too fast
Ill prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
Ill prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin
Ill prolly die cause thats what you do when youre 17
All worries in a hurry I wish I controlled things

When I was 27 I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated ten times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money is God playin a joke on me
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before
At 27 my biggest fear was losin it all
Scared to spend money had me sleepin from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my momma stressin
Thirty shows a month and I still wont buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor Somebody thats holdin my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
I read a case about Rihannas accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
The type of shitll make me flip out and just kill somethin drill somethin
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin
I practiced runnin from fear guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old my biggest fear was bein judged
How they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
What they say bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make em highlight my simplest lines
Im talkin fear fear of losin creativity
Im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me
Im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride
Cause my DNA wont let me involve in the light of God
Im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone
Im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more
Im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness
Fear whatever it is both is distinctive
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Searchin for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Wonderin if Im livin through fear or livin through rap
Damn

Outro Carl Duckworth
Verse two says You only have I known of all the families of the Earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments were gonna feel this way
Were gonna be under this curse because He said hes gonna punish us
The socalled Blacks Hispanics and Native American Indians
are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel Hes gonna punish us for our iniquities
for our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods 
that are the last as of his son so the Lord thy God chasten thee
So just like you chasten your own son
Hes gonna chastise you because He loves you
So thats why we get chastised thats why were in the position that were in
Until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments
and do what the Lord said these curses are gonna be upon us
Were gonna be at a lower state in this life 
that we live here in today in United States of America
I love you son and I pray for you

Oh Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana times is hard
Pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives Im a star
Life is one funny mufucka
A true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
I might be buggin infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts children listen it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest povertys dialect
Adaptation inevitable
Gun violence crack spot federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Wellrespected calm and collected
Laughin and jokin made life easier
Hard times momma on crack a fouryearold tellin his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin and bangin
He was meant to be dangerous clocked him a grip and start slangin
Fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodgin policemen workin for his big homie
Smalltime hustler graduated to a brick on him
10000 dollars out of a project housin thats on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters  caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin but witnesses couldnt prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin
Birdshufflin Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the twotone Mustang that 50 thing
They say 50 came circlin parkin lots and parkin spots
And hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it he brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken see at this chicken spot
There was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth he worked the window
His name was Ducky he came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside projects Chiraq the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hopin that hed see college
Hustlin on the side with a ninetofive to freak it
Cadillac Seville hed ride his son around on weekends
Threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket
Cross the street from the projects Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in 84
Thats when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin us sellin us devilish works killin us crime
Intelligent felonious prevalent proposition with 9s
Ducky was well aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured hed get on these niggas good sides free chicken 
Every time Anthony posted in line two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didnt kill him in fact it look like theyre the last to survive
Pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma and Ill tell you why
You take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
Give em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers you make em meet again
Inside recordin studios where they reapin their benefits
Then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky Top Dawg could be servin life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight gunshot

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians push an 04 MercedesBenz
Hello my name is Kendrick she said No youre handsome
Whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancin
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin shades now cool
Where you stay She said Down the street from Dominguez High
Okay I know thats borderline Compton or Paramount Well is it Compton
No she replied and quickly start battin her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful What you tryna get into
She didnt tell just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now Im likin her
Conversation we having probably enticin her
Who could imagine Maybe my actions would end up wifin her
Love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us
Its deep rooted the music of bein young and dumb
Its never muted in fact its much louder where Im from
We know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetriuss irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin a nut
I wanna come over whats up Thats what I told her 
soon as this episode of Martin go off Im tryin to get off
I was in heat like a cactus my tactics of bein thirsty
Probably could hurt me but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my mommas keys hopped in the car then oh boy
So now Im down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin Alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
Im thinkin bout that sex  thinkin bout her thighs 
or maybe kissin on her neck or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin up my texts
I looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse
And Im a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
Im hopin to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
Im two blocks away 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay she wavin me cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face and then I see
Two niggas two black hoodies I froze as my phone rang

Bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my VIBE bitch dont kill my vibe

Kendrick Lamar
Uh look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous I can say that I like a challenge 
and you to me is painless you dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge even a small lighter can burn a bridge

Interlude

Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
Youre trying to keep it deprived and only cosign what radio does
And Im looking right past you we live in a world we live in a world 
on two different axles you live in a world you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to this shit is vital I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain rather a seasonal name Ill let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Imma break out and then hide every lock Imma break out and then hide every lock

Ill take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream its alive

Kendrick Lamar
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the Federales will roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today
cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate if its necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know you think its an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
of the working world we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth usually Im drugfree
But shit Im with the homies

Yeah nigga we off of pill and Remy Red
 Come through and bust ya head nigga
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
 where my niggas pour up fo and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my motherfucking niggas
 Hop out do my stuff then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact I hope out that motherfucker
 and be like dodododo Dododododo

Its 230 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
Ill tell you to suck my dick then Ill continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the lightskinned girls in all their little dresses good Lord
They knew we werent from round there
cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions the perfect combination
Before we sparked the conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didnt like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger
I mean I never was stranger to the folk neither I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
Thats ironic cause Ive never been violent
until Im with the homies

Just riding just riding
Me and the homies
Bullshitting acting a fool
Me and the homies
Tripping really tripping
Me and the homies
Just riding just riding just riding

Bragging bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didnt make me feel that bad
Im usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up beefing if we aint got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still nigga what is you saying
Pull in front of the house that weve been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right then made a left then made a right
Then made a left we was just circling life
My mama called kicking it
I should have told her Im probably bout to catch my first offense
with the homies

police sirens ring

But they made a right then made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure
Me and the homies
This is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure
Me and the homies
And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure

This is the art of peer pressure

Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus dont miss them stockings liquor spillin pistols poppin
Bakin soda yola whippin aint no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue everyday Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do when you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut them serpents lurkin blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs but its all good
Broken promises steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree

Song   Poetic Justice

Every second every minute man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high hands up high hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now put me in the mood
Im talking bout dark room perfume
Go go

Kendrick Lamar
I recognize your fragrance hol up
You aint never gotta say shit woo
And I know your taste is
A little bit mmm high maintenance ooh
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Yall curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party She wanna go and party
Nigga dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga that aint good game homie sorry
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
less I write it down for real PS

Chorus 2X Kendrick Lamar
You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want Poetic Justice put it in a song

Drake
I really hope you play this
Cause ol girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
Youve been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It dont make sense
Young East African Girl you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its all right here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doing that walk for
When I see that thing move I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
PS

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talking poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb Its you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb Its you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve I want that interference
Its coherent I can hear it mmhmm
Thats your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me mmhmm
Breathe slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely yours truly
And right before you go blind
PS

Chorus Pharrell
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby

Kendrick Lamar
Look inside these walls and you see them havin withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you Im tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that Im easily prey I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building its probably big as a building
Me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
But what am I supposed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that I aint but know Im accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place they was wonderin if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I dont mind because one day youll respect the good kid mAAd city

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
All I see is strobe lights blinding me in my hindsight
Findin me by myself promise me you can help 
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standin still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask Lift up your shirt cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter Hes probably young but I know that hes down
Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
He dont mind he know well never respect the good kid mAAd city

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
All I see in this room 20 Xanies and these shrooms
Grownup candy for pain can we live in a sane society
Its entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20 Xanies and shrooms
Some grownup candy I lost it I feel its nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid mAAd city

Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time Im in the street I hear YAWK YAWK YAWK YAWK

Chorus
Man down where you from nigga
Fuck who you know where you from my nigga
Where your grandma stay huh my nigga
This mAAd city I run my nigga

Kendrick Lamar
Brace yourself Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is culdesac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me LBoogs and YanYan YG Lucky ridin down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin your hand out the window check yo self
Uh warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow dance 
with society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where censored hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time with the slidin door fuck is up
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
Pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch a wall of bullets comin from
AKs ARs Aye yall duck
Thats what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man goddamn all Hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in 94 fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose you wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty just pieces BGs up to preapprove
Bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess

Kendrick Lamar
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the livin room in my mommas pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still wont ever know my life
Kendrick aka Comptons human sacrifice

Interlude MC Eiht
Gyeah Cocaine weed
Niggas been mixin shit since the 80s loc
Sherm sticks butt nakeds

Cluckheads all up and down the block and shit
One times crooked and shit block a nigga in

MC Eiht
Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drivebys in the hood lately
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip we in the hood still
So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a motherfucker stand

Kendrick Lamar
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16 would you believe me
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some Now  Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip the Children of the Corn they vandalizin
The option of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive hit the powder 
Then watch this flame that arrive in his eye this a coward
The concept is aim and they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what

Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank

Kendrick Lamar
Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
I was in a dark room loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
that Ima get fucked up filling up my cup I see the crowd move
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

Chorus
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor Ima dive in it
Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank

Kendrick Lamar
OK now open your mind up and listen me Kendrick
 I am your conscience if you do not hear me then you will be history Kendrick
 I know that youre nauseous right now and Im hoping to lead you to victory Kendrick
If I take another one down Ima drown in some poison abusing my limit
I think that Im feeling the vibe I see the love in her eyes
I see the feeling the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize this is parental advice then apparently
Im overinfluenced by what you are doing I thought I was doing the most then someone said to me

When the lights shut off and its my turn

to settle down my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me

Kendrick Lamar
I woke up this morning and figured Id call you
In case Im not here tomorrow Im hopin that I can borrow
a peace of mind Im behind on whats really important
My mind is really distorted I find nothin but trouble in my life
Im fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive
Everybodys a victim in my eyes
When I ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering Get em
I got em and I aint give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngn in pajamas and Duntaduns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child Im proud and well devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever Ima push it wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope three gunshots

Chorus  minus first two lines

Kendrick Lamar
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section80 the message resembled Brendas Got a Baby
Whats crazy was I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judgin her past and shit
Well its completely my future her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit
And Ima need that 40 dollars
Even if I gotta fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park Im followed by a married man a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with Es
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes I run away and never do miss em
See my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet a leader you need her to learn something
Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught
Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed
And Im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
My sister died in vain but what point are you tryin to gain
If you cant fit the pumps I walk in Ill wait
 Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song
Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great
A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get or die tryin
Im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin
fading You lyin to these motherfuckers talkin about you can help em
With my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
Dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga this bullshit

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away It its today I hope I hear a
cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots
And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of wonderin when Ima rest
And youre right your brother was a brother to me
And your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the TV screen
By any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between
Her personal life I was like It need to be told
Cursin the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly whatd happen if I aint continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
Fightin for your rights even when youre wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when Im gone
Now am I worth it 
Did I put enough work in 

Chorus  minus first two lines

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say when I feel
and I look in the mirror and know Im there
With my hands in the air Im proud to say yeah
Im real Im real Im really really real 4X

Kendrick Lamar
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him you love them you love her
You love so much you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold with the sequin
You love handbag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold thats green I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you cant see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks youll still say youre lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women you love keepin control
Of everything that you love you love beef
You love streets you love runnin duckin police
You love your hood might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes cant you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A dont come free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word but but what if I got love
I love them I love when I love her
I love so much I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause youre the girl I attract
I love second verse cause youre the homie that packed
Burner like a stove top that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact I love it so much I dont love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I dont love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that Im season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility Im talkin about
Hatin all money power respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real

Kendricks father
Kenny I aint trippin off that Dominos anymore just calling 
Sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy but dont learn the hard way like I did homie

Alright thats all I wanted to tell you

about the good book because right about now thats what yall need 
Oh and Top Dawg called the house too 
I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio 
But look you take this music business serious and put out something me and your dad can step to 
Shit you know we from Chicago you know thats what we do

Interlude Anna Wise

If I dont hear from you by tomorrow I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes 
Come back a man tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton
Let em know you was just like them
but you still rose from that dark place of violence becoming a positive person 
But when you do make it give back with your words of encouragement
and thats the best way to give back 
To your city and I love you Kendrick

Just searching for the perfect shot

Hook
When love comes calling dont love back
When love comes calling dont look away
When love comes calling dont look back
When love comes calling dont look away

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
I used to write rhymes all day and all night
While you were playing Playstation my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 314 its time to give me a slice my nigga
This is a dogs fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks his uncles pumped packs
Pump fake jumpshot ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
Thats because thats these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga I stole a bible is that a sin
Pardon me though Im searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city thats mad that hes handsome
Where is the love

Hook
When love comes calling dont love back
When love comes calling dont look away
When love comes calling dont look back
When love comes calling dont look away

Verse 2
Give me rings give me chains mane
Give me a blue Benz red Porsche red Range
Give me black bitches white hoes new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some land or maybe Ill land a G5
Clearportsay hello to the man
Give me awards grammies and let the crowd applaud
My name til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 4040 no 40s but rose poured
Give me vanity give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity no give me the charts
And if you ever renege Ill still give you Kendrick Lamar this is me
And thats love

For the record I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too and thats random but so what Haha

Verse 1
Gimme that beat fool this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I aint gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad pussy you fucked with the wrong one
Im on one Ill make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state if I raise the crime rate
Its a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanyes Touch the Sky
But Ill be looking past that Im tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens the rebel of the reverend
Yall married to the game well Im bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour bonjour I mean war like that
Yeah straight like that

Hook
People dont be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me One time
Youll never know when Im gone Two times

Verse 2
In 2010 Im tryna ball nigga
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall nigga
Thats a quote from AbSoul
I suppose since you laugh thats the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass big tits she on me
And just to get to me shell fuck the homies homies homies
The life of a cool nigga my nigga Tony said
Just do you nigga Show and prove nigga
And they gon play you for a fool thats for sure
til they know you got the stinkiest stool nigga
I aint tripping Im just tipping on fofos
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold hes sick con slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah ooh
Straight like that

Hook

Verse 3
Why yall complain about OGs
I dont look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube
I dont care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga I dont need a maid nigga
Do I need a cosign from Dre or Jigga
They can make me much bigger
But do I need em though I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
Me Against The World on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a 45 dog get smoked Chris Tucker
Uhh tryna record my steelo
Even when Im not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what Im talking bout I look at your Audemars
To put yall in time out its time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms Winehouse
Just salute grab a flute and pull the wine out ooh
Just like that

Verse 1
Welcome to my diary stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me rather than societys
Woes let me go let me shine a lil bit love
I want diamonds too Ronnie on Players Club
I used to have a 9 to 5 fresh out of school that was 05
That bitch was racist got me fired ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit judge give me life nigga
Pain since my grandmas death uncle killed at Louiss Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margins margin
Maintaining my modest modest as I dream
So while I go through all this all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry

I said keep reading my diary when my lifes entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldnt hire me I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So whats up baby I said whats up
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I aint tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop watching for hollowtip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another mans block
Man thats my worst fear aint that your worst fear
You know when your transmission go out and cant switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause them theyll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll

Verse 3 AbSoul
Welcome to my diary hmm where should I begin
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7Up and prometh
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot Tequila hit me like a nina
My skys gray my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please J Coles her ghost writer
And Im the God MC join my diocese
Free your mind dont mind society
And finally everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
Ima drown in my drink and swim in my womans vagina
Like a piranha fin it gets harder than Rihanna when

She Needs Me

Intro
One time reporting live Compton California

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
She go to work she go to school her body smooth no tattoos
Type of girl thatll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too shes compatible shes independent
She handle her business she believe in God and no other religions
Shes never in competition when it comes to her friends shes dependable
She set her own trends a confidant a mediator so sweet every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor look at her hips I want to be her pager
Conservative affirmative actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her a blind man can see a true queen and she needs me
She needs me she needs me she needs me she needs me
The beauty of her swear to God a blind man can see a true queen and she needs me

Chorus JaVont
That girl is smoking and can you believe that Im her focus
It aint hard to see she got me open and together we are rollercoasting on

Verse 2 Kendrick Lamar
Five years later an accounting major work at a firm
Abundance of paper she got a career she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss executive meetings consecutive trips vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building real estate property
She order tender steak only one mouth to feed funded a youth center
Invested in some stock doubled what she put in then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl how great life can be even though she got the world she needs me
She needs me she needs me she needs me she needs me
Oh what a girl wonder how her life can be and though she got the world she needs me

Chorus JaVont
That girl is smoking and can you believe that Im her focus
It aint hard to see she got me open and together we are rollercoasting on

Verse 3 Kendrick Lamar
We lose touch separated years pass Im outdated
Shes dating one of Hollywoods famous entertainers Denzel good
Paparazzi spot em out shopping Tuesday morning brunch Benihanas
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you Emmy Awards Academy too
On the red carpet dress matching his suit she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds star gazing caught her on the stage a proposal was waiting
He bent down got on one knee she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me she needs me she needs me she needs me
Even if we seem to separate eventually itll come to pass and shell need me
I need her we need we

Chorus JaVont
That girl is smoking and can you believe that Im her focus
It aint hard to see she got me open and together we are rollercoasting on

Kendrick Lamar
See yall dont understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You cant cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
Im on point like period
Ive been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did I stand for what I believe in
Family God and honor
From Chicago my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king reign supreme named Kendrick
I aint lying it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well Ive had this world since birth
Feel the good kids hunger
The Crips made strong the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart then tell him Im the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you cant control greatness less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that cant stop it
Nigga get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it aint you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career but now hes here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I am

Intro
Its like I dont think you fully understand who I am ya know
Im just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I dont represent no colors I represent my lil sisters and brothers
Im the oldest nigga
And if you cant respect that your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

Verse 1
I used to wanna rap like JayZ
Until I finally realized that Jay wasnt me
I took my time to jot down every line thats a quotable
Critics say I dont be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
Im working on my hooks my nigga I aint tryna battle you
But even if I did I guarantee Id overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
Imma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now thats a comparison that you probably wouldnt understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an 87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor but still I remain focused
In due time Ill be able to swipe my card and it wont say decline
That shits embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But its a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen
My momma believed in me she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty thats who I do it fo
My pops got a different approach yeah he believed
But he always questioned when Imma drop my debut CD
How long this gon take nigga You still havent ate nigga
At twentytwo I had two cars and my own place nigga
Its a sacrifice I try to tell him
Thats when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit dont sound like shit
I aint tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

Hook
Yep yep thats my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor thats poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs man I wanna be heard
Like a cattle with sheep
While yall sleep I be up cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say Imma be heard

Verse 2
What up DZYNE I aint forgot nigga
You developed me telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first thats whats for sure
At the church recording at the garage but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured its best I stay away
And I was wrong I was young and couldnt look you in the eye for what Id done
But Im telling you we aint done
Matter of fact hows your sons What they up to
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
With school in the morning yawning but I was on it
Me you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga Its been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

Hook

Verse 3
So can you feel it
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit
Does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee dont he look like Sounwave
Thats kinda random but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twentyfour hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy but Im a Black one
With Jesus Christ passion I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals I aint mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you thats your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably cant heal cancer but I can heal the city
My niggas tell me you with me
And if you is wont you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk then let it bump so I can be heard
Yeah uh huh

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply 7 days later after I wrote em
Stay strong keep your faith in God what I told him
Hoping that hes listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Grams old
Your brothers getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that hes focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell its been 30 weeks
Aint recieved any mail
Its cold and the hole stinks
And you cant even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write I can only imagine
Jason Keaton I can only imagine

Lifes about decisions man
Its in your hand and you got it

Verse 2 Kendrick Lamar
Sitting on the couch that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out 15 years to count
Havent seen the world in so long
Havent seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldnt find his identity
Got it straight got a place found some serenity
Found a job found his Mothers grave site found a 40 ounce
Then he found God then he bounced then he found a new chick
Two kids wide hips found something in her we didnt see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her an investment
Then found guilty somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle was working with two strikes
Only out a year now facing life
I can only imagine
Thats fucked up
I can only imagine Uncle Bob

Hook

Verse 3 Kendrick Lamar
Sitting on the couch thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state wont oversee
They make the term severe a conspiracy
Thats what I call it its full of shit
A toilet can help quick the government help
No just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there yeah
Its justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals aint for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
Were being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I aint a drinker Im a thinker call it what you want
But if you turn your back know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit thats ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God What is my purpose
He said to live the way he did thats all he want from me
Spread the word and witness he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit my life is so fucked up man I cant help but give in
Im giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like Im free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

Hook BJ The Chicago Kid
What am I gonna do

Verse 2 Kendrick Lamar
Single black parent from Compton raising children of 4
Thats 4 innocent bastards cause Papa they dont know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Cant find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy aint bout shit that nigga aint bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that hell mature
And maybe one day his kids something that hell live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
Because its hard trying to pay the bills when youre by yourself
She thought about credit card scams til she heard a voice
That said The Devil is a lie make a better choice
And so its back to McDonalds and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Rays killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer orangutans bang like gorillas
Its jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth my nigga didnt deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
Its ill to see my faith try and leave me
Its so hard to get it to get rid of it is easy
Im tryna reach Cloud 9 thats what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer just know I tried
I should have never looked into his sons eyes

Verse 4 Kendrick Lamar
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your minds slipping wondering Is there really a God
Knowing you shouldnt think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever theres pain that feeling forever remains
We cant believe what we cant see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12 and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers thats human nature you aint in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirits in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I aint ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better or I dont know no better
But what I do know is that Hes real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your worlds about to end
I hope you studied because Hes testing your faith again

Outro Kendrick Lamar
Id rather not live like there isnt a God
Than die and find out there really is

Boarding completed Id like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirtythreethousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally

Verse 1
Uh coming down like Im uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it dont matter cause she still gon let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some LA weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention doing extraextra
Downgrading yourself you get an F for effort
Haha I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you dont like a nigga then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
Im laid back with a bad one you aint never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 105 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness Im Cadillacs grandson

Hook
And Im a trip
Ever since an understudy man Ive always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears you aint heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause Im a trip

Verse 2
Landing on another runway fly with me
Or die tryna fly a shotdown Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy nigga we on
Like we never been off straight shots of Patron
Im give yall the business to give yall some business
Pussy aint shit I can give yall some bitches
Clean off her sports bra she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols hood rats I hate those
And she know what this is hey lil mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil mama
But why you always in somebody face lil mama
Embarrassing yourself get off the stage Lil Mama
Nigga I gotta be that nigga
If I aint I gotta beat that nigga
Curtesy of Paulas oldest son pay homage
Or pay attention open your eyes and hear knowledge

Hook

Verse 3
Gigive me that gigigive me that
Thats how I get at em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of yall can visit
That might be outer space the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you dont see it then youre dead with your eyes open
Ive seen bullets hit the wheel left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody thatll ride or die thats a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
Itll take twenty years fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping the sawedoff pumping
The tree for the low dont you know Paul Bunyan
Im on cloud nine I can see rain coming
So if Im out my mind people dont say nothing

Verse 1
Sometimes I want to leave sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This songs bout a young boy thats gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades we feel free to fly
Were birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror Im trendy enough Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
Its not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now lets draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward then Ill rewind a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are farther youre from the white mans home
Negro spiritual songs gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage our freedom was so vague
Couldnt see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross uh
And school was exempt see we couldnt have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears and tribulations miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci its fake then she fool me
She still bad though and her fake Gucci aint that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26s after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves

Outro
I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
Youre a vanity slave
If youre a female and you got 456 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
Youre a vanity slave
If you got an 02 Monte Carlo with 24s on it
And on the back of the window it says Get on my level ho
Youre a vanity slave

Were all vanity slaves and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at
Im not from around here hey Ali where we at Idaho
Yeah nigga you know the first of the month checks coming in
Im tryna get some
What up

Schoolboy Q
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers they wont even see my vision
Im stuck on the studio couch now thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or seems like I need a mill to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a birds head higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me living my life
Though its better to write
Configuring my style to the streets bring dark to the light
So how you feel My nigga I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star Mr Lamar

Hook 2 Kendrick Lamar
So Im feeling like I want to I want to
I want to I want to go so far from here

VERIFIED COMMENTARY BY
Rapper Big Pooh 
    
Intro
Reporting live from Compton California
North Cackalack

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
Now everybody just bow to the greatness or die in the matrix
Youre hereby dating my destinys waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record Im truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar no Audemar on my wrist
Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch get busy
Im busy taking over the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
Im live come to the harvest welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Booyaa who ya No one Ive done situated myself I aint lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping but I aint tripping swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

Hook Kendrick Lamar
A yes yes yall and you dont stop
A yes yes yall and you dont stop
A yes yes yall and you dont stop
Kendrick show these muhfuckers how we rock
A yes yes yall and you dont stop
A yes yes yall and you dont stop
A yes yes yall and you dont stop
Big Pooh show these muhfuckers how we rock

Verse 2 Rapper Big Pooh
Yo its evident Im evidently your favorite
All I ask open your ears and please savor it
The taste is unacquired quietly been inspired
Im at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now Im brushing off the dust
We dont need no water fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain I consider that a plus
Im a grown man so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing consider me the inbetween
The new regime taking over
Either we each others opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next you unlucky bastard
Im getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life Rosie no longer here
I swear

Hook

Verse 3 Kendrick Lamar
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a twoman city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine Ive got to be a prophet
Ive gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
Im a Hub City representer so Ive got to represent the
City like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

Verse 4 Rapper Big Pooh
UPS I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter all guts no glory
Station on repeat they retread the same story
New niggas bore me tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head youngun its that real Hip
Hop along fore you get your little ass whipped

Intro Kendrick Lamar
Everybody just clap your hands if your a real
Middle finger up give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself just show me youre real
Middle fingers up

Hook Kendrick Lamar
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats thats the only way I know how to hold it down

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
I just wanna be me
No disrespect but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold my style making my nose run
Oh I stare at the mirror then realize that real lies within me
Some say Im crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if Im not clubbing dont think Im on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But Id just rather 2step like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod as my head rests
Yes

Hook Kendrick Lamar
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats thats the only way I know how to hold it down

Verse 2 Kendrick Lamar
And yeah I know Im from Compton Cali
But I dont lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans aint quite the lick
I probably would wear em but my dick dont fit
Ha ha ha I like to joke got a sense of humor
Still face play me short like an oompa loompa
You aint gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Wont you lighten up like Michael did
I grew up with killas man people who killed men
But my character never could be like them man
And they respect that say that Im real man
Not a fake person thats the Sims man
Live my life through some film man
I aint acting out shit I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they dont know Kendrick fo sho
And oh

Hook Kendrick Lamar
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats thats the only way I know how to hold it down

Verse 3 Kendrick Lamar
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads aint nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said Boy that dont sound like you
I said This is the sound though
My only excuse
Quite frankly dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate is cause these motherfuckers aint me
And you can underrate me but I know what Im worth
A diamond in Gods dirt a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me

Hook Kendrick Lamar
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Just let me be me
Thats the only way I know
Thats the only way I know how to hold it down
Thats thats the only way I know how to hold it down

Verse 4 Kendrick Lamar
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it
If I didnt I guess Im a cool cocaine connect
That means Ill be frontin
Cooking in a laboratory hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel like the ones that came before me
Knowing that Im misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is Will the radio care
Yeah or should I say no
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach
You heard my hiphop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then now Im an adult
22 like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined but with the smallest of funds to show
But Im not worried
My talent should take me places Ive never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring the stress the violence
The capital punishment the loud police sirens
Too focused one word righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar and soon yall know Cloud 9 yall
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused one word righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused one word

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
Go getter with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I cant win if I cant get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success
Having the worlds best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream I feel J Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That dont wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked yall was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I dont wanna be a killer I wanna be a Gates

Hook Ash Riser
In time itll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove prove youre the one
Its not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

Verse 2 Kendrick Lamar
What I gotta do in order to see success
Having the worlds best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin
Better yet rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga thats constantly braggin
Catch him at the light snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I dont wanna be a dealer I wanna be a trump
Donald that is

Hook 2 Ash Riser  Kendrick Lamar
In time itll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove prove youre the one
Its not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out
Go out and get it
But for now Imma go head and doug it out
I gotta rhyme rhyme
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

Verse 3 Kendrick Lamar
So welcome to the story of my life
See Im tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune by some Porsches for my momma and my wife
Pops engine in this old school run tiiight
But as you listening to KDOT
Man me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say is Damn
These niggas that much better than me baby
I dont think this is meant to be
Cause Im always losing self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said Huh
I repeated what I said then she replied Shut up
You know you the best boy you gotta keep doing it
But dont forget when you do just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Dont be a typical artist be more like Jay
Russell Barry Gordy Quincy Jones Bob Johnson Sean Combs LA Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed yeah
So I gotta see success I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop and Ill pop on whoevers in my way

Hook 1

Go out and get it

Produced by The Roots

Intro Dash Snow
Ill tell you what I dont believe in can I do that All right I dont believe in laws or the system by any means whatsoever I try not to obey them at anytime Thats what I believe in not believing in

So what keeps you alive

Four big bottles of water a day two packs of Marlboro Reds And uh I dont  what keeps me alive shit Music I have to listen to music all day long Id say that keeps me going Im a pretty dark person Ive thought about ending it a million times And I have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing

Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar
Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now freestyle or write down whatever
It stillll come up clever
I just need to free my thoughts and Lord knows that I know better
But I aint perfect I aint seen too many churches
Or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead die trying and know death
Might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones but where Im from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
Im living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison he wasnt wrapped too tight
He told me rap about life not rap niggas
Thats why Im shaking my head when you rap dissin
My stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up would just come up
We used to beefing over turf fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Compton lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap saran our defiance ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 fourfours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listen to Faith and think I know Zion
But really Im just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
Because it seem like its always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright Id probably go blind before I blink twice I aint lying
I swear to God half of yall just dont know Kendrick
The school of hardknocks we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block he got shot you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head kneel down and then tie your tennis
Its kind of scary aint it
You cant act like no bitch that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this why you pick up that stainless
Cuz your pops wasnt anxious
To see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break I still wont break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And Im like The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month all right
Gotta keep it pushing
Cant let the government tell me how my future looking
Im on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know Im bookin
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my moms placenta
In the gutter lane like Im Master Splinter
How splendid I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks I said fifteen
Called it an EP they said Im trippin
But little did they know Im tryna change the rules
That weve been confined to so the corporate wont make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams stealing our vision
Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of yall cats just dont know Kendrick
You barely know yourself so I guess most of yall should be offended
Aint doing this for my health Im tryna purchase my momma dem Benzes
Occupying my time with riches justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide just to go inside plus we idolize why we living
Look the mastermind took the masters mind
Just the perfect time just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look the mastermind took  cough

Hook Jhene Aiko
Where are we going why are we slowing down
Where are you going we should be growing now
Smoke to it nigga smoke to it nigga
Where are we going why are we slowing down
Where are you going we should be growing now

Verse 1
Thats what she said to me that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We dont even sleep neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile Im in these streets with everybody Im trying to get it
And she know they got me I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters dont reach you I hope these lyrics in sync

Hook Jhene Aiko
Where are we going why are we slowing down
Where are you going we should be growing now

Verse 2
Thats what it said to me but the place I call ambition
Now dead to me gone and forgotten Im off track
Like Dale Earnhardt my liver rotten alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night guys and dolls
Balling out but Im about to drop the ball
Im calling out for help my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him nah

Hook Jhene Aiko
Where are we going why are we slowing down
Where are you going we should be growing now

Verse 3
Thats what he said to me
But that place we call Heavens unfair to me only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I dont know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means Im following evil
Guess Im following evil I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I dont need you

Hook Jhene Aiko
Where are we going why are we slowing down
Where are you going we should be growing now

Verse 4
So in conclusion sometimes we lose focus planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life I apologize
I promise to stay faithful focused and sanctified
We all get distracted the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards Would you not know
How to act or take action Its just a part of life
And if your visions impaired you probably lose it all tonight

Outro Jhene Aiko
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my visions so blurry
Tryna slow it down stay close to the ground but were always in a hurry
And if I could make this world spin a little slower then I would
Then we could grow a little closer I think were getting closer

Pain since my grandmas death Uncle killed at Louies Burgers

Far beyond the stars Are you a Martian
Youre unfamiliar but still I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling

If you was I would climb every other stair

A oneonone you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young

PreChorus
Lips hips hair drips down her back
Crazy Body frame Crazy Insane Crazy
The only girl that can make time

So now we on so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown

We do it sweet they look bitter
Look at her get up I hear em say
But why him I hear em hate

Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
Cause Im addicted and you the drug
Cold turkey No sir

You definitely know probably I gotta give it up

PreChorus
Lips hips hair drips down her back
Crazy Body frame Crazy Insane Crazy
The only girl that can make time

Intro
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us love people
Im inspired so get inspired

Verse 1
And so he said Why you gotta be so kind hearted
Why you couldnt be a con artist Why you couldnt
Why you couldnt be mischievous or just a lil devious
The moment that we first started
Why you never ask for nothing just a lil time
Why you let me use yours cus I dont got mine
Why you always lift me up when Im completely giving up
Or when niggas holla Whats up you give a dry response
Why you giving me your last knowing you aint got it
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping
Why you tell me that you love me Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too
Why you making promises that youll forever do
Whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you Sometimes

Hook
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us

Bridge Javonte
Sometimes I sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common it aint fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care once upon a time
Once upon a time we was there

Verse 2
And so she said Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you dont know what you mean to me
Why you always playing games Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me
Why text messages popping up saying Hi Daddy
Why you treat me like Im nothing Why you always at a function
I be wanting to go out but you dont ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex
Everytime we get into it Im the one thats feeling stupid
You dont need me you gon leave me thats ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely
Why I feel Im the last option after ya homies
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me Sometimes

Hook
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us love people that hurt us

Bridge Javonte
Sometimes I sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common it aint fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care once upon a time
Once upon a time we was there

Outro Lamont Carey
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me even when I want to be left alone
But shes beautiful
Like sometimes when I have things on my mindshes the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice
She says she loves me
And she only gives advice
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when Im stepping out of the shower shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off
She says she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me and I dont know about love

Verse 1
Lord forgive me kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand then jump back in that mini van
Double back to his block and blam I aint backing down for nothing
Imma back em down like Shaq with this black 223 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land
On your corner coroners comfort your momma
Momma hes dead the next morning I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana want us to change our ways Uhhuh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished I dont know I dont have conscience
I just load up and start dumping on enemies Im head hunting
No sympathy aint no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they coming for sets respect split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumbling like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss

Hook Schoolboy Q
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you dont give a fuck put your hands up high

Verse 2
This the hardest shit youve heard from LA this far
And Im this far from a discharge but never will I diss yall
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock Ill dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers til yall pissed off then peel off
In a hooptie come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably Im too street indubitably Imma do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak but just give me 2 weeks and Im good
Ill make an album thatll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God Im the future for Heavens talent
No tarot card reading Im foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game Im including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect dammit or get damaged
Die young corpse identified by your parents
Apparently youre a parrot mocking me and my blueprint
But I wont share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it Im hearin the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully every shooter be callin me Compton
So truthfully only calling me Kweli and Common
Proves that ignorance is bliss

Hook Schoolboy Q
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you dont give a fuck put your hands up high

Verse 3
And this still the hardest shit youve heard from LA this far
And Im this far from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin so hard
Im SoCal you socalled rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters Im Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off you a hundred percent behind me
And if you are then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin down bargains backin down bitches
We gon flip her once she off that blue dolphin you gon tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willie B Im a fool on your beats I bleed out the speaker
As the speaker that spoke when they didnt speak

Intro
This is me thinking at 443 AM June 6

Verse Kendrick Lamar
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping I need money now
Like should I start trapping If what I write down
Dont collect this very moment then Im on it no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected lets see
Do I cop a pound of kush Promethazine or push some E
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep
This is deep as the abyss Im not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga what you doing on these corners with me
I thought you had a show Well ma nigga I guess I didnt
Im tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twentytwo on twentysixes Range Rovers rolling up
Threefifty for an ounce of fire I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff I need a new solution
Curveserving know I might be in your store boosting
211s with Mac11s like fuck Hip Hop
Dont wanna be Pun dont wanna be BIG dont wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds AKA everything that you got
Or everything getting shot for nothing
Leave you in shock coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your moms momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam water
Sherm contraband they yearn for the buttnaked
Fuck a verse verses get let off in thirty minutes six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie if you knew me
Youll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing
But lately Ive been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially so please dont be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do no shit
So I tell my nigga front me let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence shit

BJ the Chicago Kid singing
There are times when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling cause there is a light that shines
Special for you and me yeah

Before they pass they pass they pass
Pass me by oh darling
Youve got to look at the other side

Intro
One time reporting live
Compton California

Verse 1
Have you ever felt like like you never get life
Like you never get right Sort of like a black sheep
Back down backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh what a cold world for a broke nigga its bitter
And lifes a bitch dont hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasnt playing
I was so sincere like Nas first name in Belly
They tell me its very difficult to see 25
And if I survive its probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppes
They want me unemployed until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke DBoys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop thats why Im

Chorus
In the club like fuck it though
They say its only one life life life
And if you say I cant live comfortable
Imma tell you thats a lie lie lie

Bridge 1
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc
With a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire

Break
We are we are fine
We are we are true
Through the through barbed wires
We will will break through

Bridge 1
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc
With a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire

Verse 2
Have you ever felt like like you never get life
Like you never get right Sort of like a black sheep
Tryna get away from the worlds stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny she desperately
In need of some inspiration see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16 credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye boyfriend brutality
Shell never get by no how no way
Welfare recipient property of the state
Housing Section 8 corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute the niggas tell her that shes cute
Hood rat trashy six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur thats why she

Chorus
In the club like fuck it though
They say its only one life life life
And if you say I cant live comfortable
Imma tell you thats a lie lie lie

Bridge 2
So while she up in VIP
Pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire

Break

Bridge 2
So while she up in VIP
Pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire

Verse 3
Have you ever felt like you finally got life
You finally got right No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uhMilian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
Its like we just hit the lottery my God
There must be a God cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyles looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you aint have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she aint have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions got a independent businessmind
And both of yall are steady grindin doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they wont give you the credit disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

Chorus
In the club like fuck it though
They say its only one life life life
And if you say I cant live comfortable
Imma tell you thats a lie lie lie

Bridge 3
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living aint bad
Know its a barbed wire thats always in your path
Through the barbed wire
Just laugh

Outro
And everybody say
Cause I wont get caught again
And Im here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night and Im gone

So you made it past all the barbed wires

Intro
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you to know me within sixteen bars
Thats the hardest thing

Verse 1
Who is K Dot A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary relatives in high school
With that being said each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head I needed survival
Got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
And I dont even push a line Im just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said youre judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider that if it goes down
Theyll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what Im doing
Im tryna duck the influence of my city thats brewing real talk and

Hook
This is why they fuck with me real talk nigga believe it
This is why they fuck with me do what I do yknow
Im no gangster no killer Im just your average Joe know that
But one thing you should consider Im the realest you know

Verse 2
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up and I was like hol up
Where you from I dont bang
Where you stay Westside thats a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the culdesac
Shots rang out hoping to God I wasnt wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I95 they said they already knew
What happened and meet em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night but needed revenge
Grabbed the nineball opened up the door then got in
Somebody said fall back we gon make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat and thats just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals fuck but

Hook
This is why they fuck with me I told you nigga
This is why they fuck with me you fake nigga
Im no gangster no killer Im just your average Joe you fake
But one thing you should consider Im the realest you know

Verse 3
I dont do black music I dont do white music
I do everyday life music
Give em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through but Ive been through it now thats cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps no powersteering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died its no joke
Dont ask why if you dont know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed you smoke that but Im high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause its hotter than a lunatics underarms in a straitjacket
In other words we get it cracking but I keep it cool you know

Hook
This is why they fuck with me laughs
This is why they fuck with me real talk
Im no gangster no killer Im just your average Joe come on
But one thing you should consider Im the realest you know

Outro
So there you have it
But Imma leave you with this
An OG once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
Im gone

Verse 1
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rappers dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their selfesteem
Thats a jab you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause Im the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four
Im on five you saying that I can level more
In high school my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didnt know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man and Columbine

Hook
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think Im off the kush or the hydro
Nope I dont even smoke I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke I dont even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I dont even smoke I dont even smoke
I dont even smoke I dont even smoke

Verse 2
Look nowadays everybody think theyre big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they cant hit the sour
Theyre new booties they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights off the chain like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth thats not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that Im talking bout
You know the type of rhymes you dont talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me like My sons bout to win
Somehow some day and I dont care when
I might hit the gin once a month
Ill let you inhale like an atheist

Hook
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think Im off the kush or the hydro
Nope I dont even smoke I dont even smoke

Verse 3
Ill take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
Thats my nigga he a street nigga
Probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me Dont hit it hard because itll hurt you
I didnt listen I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
Im Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter capital KDOT
Laying it flat out like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you bout Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I dont puff a square
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt Yeah

Hook
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think Im off the kush or the hydro

Verse 1
Uh Im tryna learn something new
Im tryna find myself Im searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings and if I speak the good
Into existence that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water Ill just wait at the dock
And by the way Imma start finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
Im back chilling with a friend of mine she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she dont like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve bitch Ima cut you off

Hook
Cause everytime you come around you be hollering that
Whoopdewhoop blahzayblah he say she say
Oh my God shut the fuck up hoe
Everytime you come around you be hollering that
Whoopdewhoop blahzayblah he say she say

Verse 2
Uh Im tryna learn something new
Im tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it TAKE just to reach the TOP
Im talking ideas motivation
Its more than making enemies my nigga
Oh thats not ya memo Then tell me why you constantly stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby mommas a rat and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing bringing me down
Speak on somethin with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims aint bigger pussy nigga Ima cut you off

Hook
Cause everytime you come around you be hollering that
Whoopdewhoop blahzayblah he say she say
Oh my God shut the fuck up scary ass
Everytime you come around you be hollering that
Whoopdewhoop blahzayblah he say she say

Verse 3
Uh Im tryna learn something new
Im tryna better my chances of becoming a star
Im tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art now paint that picture
Life behind bars remember the very day I got caught
I murdered a rapper and you filed the police report
See what I was taught family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides but Id never give in
Ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays left my uncle in prison
For 15 years no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang and if your blood wasnt running through my veins
I would prolly cut yall off too yep

Hook
Cause everytime yall come around yall be hollering that
Whoopdewhoop blahzayblah he say she say

What is HiiiPoWeR
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think the way we live
See its known today that the human race is nothing
No morals no standards
What were about to do is raise the level of expectations
No you dont have to have a lot of money
You dont have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say its as big as a crew some say its as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR we stand for it as if its as big as a religion

Verse Kendrick Lamar
Niggas hatin bitches hatin babies dyin
Bullets flyin helicopters police sirens preachers lying
Genocism criticism unemployment racism
Burning buildings AIDS victims cancer killin no cure
Oil spillin turmoil poverty stricken police brutality
Kickin ass of us Africans hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison child molesting
Cow intestines botox injections earthquakes thats government tested
Secret society weapon opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back great depression amongst Iraq no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soowoop swerving izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin these commercials keep us buyin
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin with science no place to live in no Zion
See thats forbidden we fryin
My nigga what it look like
Thats exactly what Hell look like

Verse 2 Kendrick Lamar
Whats up love Its been a while
You been good Ive been around
Remember dinner dates I was late Mr Chows
Truant like a student you the principal
Schooled me on timing we was both shining
Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
I was Your Highness you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound Kosher no sir
Wake it back up Folgers holsters
By my waistline shot for your heart and
You called it a hate crime say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom thats high school shit
401 K we could be friends with benefits you dig that

Hook JaVonte
That girl is smoking
And can you believe that Im her focus
It aint hard to see she got me open
And together we are rollercoasting on on on

Verse 3 MURS
I upped and walked out now she crying cuz
She need me I got that Jon Brion love
Had to find love we called it punchdrunk
We was a twopiece she was a onepunch
You know a knockout and if she was to walk out
My heart would go black shrivel up and drop out
There we go again what the fuck you talking bout
We used to fuck all the time back at my mommas house
Smoking beedies laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And wed be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then couldnt cop the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if Id tapped that
I would say yep smiling so freely
That was back then but I bet she still need me
She need me she need me
She need me she need me
I would say yes smiling so freely
That was back then I bet she still need me

Only concerned with my balls like Venus

Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
theyll probably think Im a terrorist
Eat my asparagus then Im asking her
Thoughts of a young nigga fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds I know you dying to meet em
Ill probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches twenty million and a Comptown fitted

Chorus
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Hol up hol up hol up hol up

Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off I call a bitch a bitch
A hoe a hoe a woman a woman I never did nothing
but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that Im easily peddling
with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults Im too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old the wiser man
Truth be told Im like 87
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance dont know which one is a Christian damn
Who can I trust in 2012 Theres no one not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help somebody

Chorus
Hol up hol up hol up hol up

Eight doobies to the face fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case nigga fuck that
Two pills and a half wait nigga fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age dont exist

Kendrick Lamar
Man I swear my nigga tripping off that shit again pick him up then I set him in
Cold water then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feeling that he feel today
You know when youre part of Section 8 and you feel like no one can relate
cause you are you are a loner loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger stronger
Im in the house party tripping off my generation sipping cough
syrup like its water never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
that the world is bout to end who gives a fuck We never do listen
unless it comes with an 808 a melody and some hoes
PlayStation and some drank technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see is a big crowd thats product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebels dream
Yep her president is black she black too
Purple label on her back but that dap
is like when she take it straight to the head then she look at me
She got ADHD

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Like whoaoh whoa
Whoaoh whoa I dont got a limit just give me some more with it
Whoaoh whoa I dont got a limit just give me some more with it
Whoaoh whoa They always told me ADHD did it
Whoaoh

And then she started
And then she started feeling herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon how I rap baby how old are you
She say twentytwo I say twentythree ok then we all crack babies
Damn why you say that She said where my drink at
Ima tell you later just tell your neighbors have the police relax
I stood up shut the blinds closed the screen JumboTron
Made to the back where she reside then she said read between the lines
Yep hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she might just open up when the new flow start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now
Its nothing we can do now somebody walked in with a pound
of that Bay Area kush she looked at me then looked
at it then she grabbed it then she said get it understood
You know why we crack babies because we born in the eighties
That ADHD crazy

I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on It was early in the morn
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction Ive outgrown
Damn girl why so much
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Dont you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
Its the beauty in her but when the makeup occur
I dont see it all I see is a blur

 My complexion in a direction Ive outgrown

 I can never put on too much makeup
 Yeah I know your imperfections I be constantly stressing
 From him is where I get it from
 They tell me I need to smile at least once in a while
 I hate my lips my nose my eyebrows
Its the beauty in me but what he dont see

Welcome to vigilante eighties so dont you ask me

Peeling off like a Xanny examine my orchestra
Granny said when Im old enough Ill be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby washed up
Pussy fix your panties Im Mr Marcus you getting fucked uh
You aint heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain Vicodins couldnt ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained to go against Dracula
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like its the 90s
Bullet to your temple youre homicidal remind me that

Im driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racing racing past Johnny because hes racist

raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch
Im really out here nigga You blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress

Run him down and then he gun him down Im hoping that you fast enough

I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing my daddy tired
I need me a weapon these niggas ride
every minute hour and second ministers tried
to save me how Im gon listen when I dont even hear God
Heaven or Hell base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son stare at the sun
and youll be looking in my eyes homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway this for my niggas
Uncles twentythree hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that Im so determined to blow
that you hear the music I wrote hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A MetroPC phone then you went back in
So when I touch the pen the pen is in my view
Ima get it right just so you

You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
Id like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
Im twentythree with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich but wealthy theres nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful the city got my back
Before that I give them my torso
You think about it and dont call me lyrical
cause really Im just a nigga thats evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So wont you bare witness while I bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On Wanna Be Heard probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio he aint know
I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it hell probably be
out of work laid back while he

Babies from eighties dont know no better

Song   Keishas Song Her Pain

Chorus Ashtro Bot
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Kendrick Lamar
Uh and Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr Shakur thats her favorite rapper
Bumping Brendas Got a Baby while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking she start running
like FloJo dont care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough dont see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy but she dont know her father thats ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
And Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is Gods temple
and its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
Shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen whats between her thighs hed compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
It was a block away from Lueders Park I seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
And Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized shell never escape the allure
of the black man white man needing satisfaction
At first it became a practice but now shes numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners redemption
That sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing
through that block away from Lueders Park I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder left her dead raped in the street
Keishas song

Mm my little sister eleven I looked her right in the face
the day that I wrote this song sat her down and pressed play

Chorus 1
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson with madness now just imagine the magic
I light to asses dont ask for your favorite rapper
He dead Yessir
Amen Chuuch
He dead I killed him
Amen Bitch

Kendrick Lamar
And this is rigamortis
and its gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and Im Morpheus
The Matrix of my mind
Im out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
Im on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
and then I end on cloud nine
And thats important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
And dont be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And Ima be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and a tie is suitable
and usual its suicide
CSI just might investigate
this fucking parasite

He dead
Amen

Thats what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Feragami so many
and cool enough for the seventies
Nigga paybacks a bitch
and bitch you been living in debt with me
That Im more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling thats irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldnt think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
Its just me Jay Rock Soul and Q
So the system aint why we cute
Nothing else you can do

Chorus 2
He dead Yep yep
Amen I killed him
He dead laughs
Amen Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson dont ask for your favorite rapper
He dead Yep yep
Amen I know
He dead For sure
Amen Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard
Im Marilyn Manson dont ask for your favorite rapper

Kendrick Lamar
I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
Ill pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners
Wont you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
and its casually done
And tell em my salary come
in lumps of a hundreds
Dont talk to me bout no money
The sun is under my feet
and I come in peace to compete
I dont run if youd rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest street
and I get busy on many emcees
Really ballistic anybody can see
Any assistance everybody done see
some persistence recognize I be
really too vicious the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets
Better partition better dot you T
and I gon mention how the fog you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
and Im charged up and the catastrophe
is starstruck and the audacity
of yall fucks never could hassle me
and yall luck just ran out youll see

Chorus 3
He dead Yup yup
Amen I know
He dead For sure
Amen Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
Ill crack the egg in your basket you bastard

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
Im dying inside I wonder if Zion inside the Heavens
A condom a rollie pain a fat blunt and a MAC11
Thats all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But Im right on the edge on Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinners advice
Well its probably you am I right If Im wrong you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling its so appealing to pray
I wonder if Im just a villain dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me dont worry bout it
I give em back they deposit no money just total silence
Im running they say Im wildin a youngun with lack of guidance
Theres hundreds of us with problems more money more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an outofcontrol artist thats dealing with life the hardest
Thats on my life but regardless Ima

Chorus

BJ the Chicago Kid
Yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure I lost one of my biggest believers ohh
Close deaths make you think about your life
like if I had the same chance twice what would I do different
Id tell her I loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when Im done recording swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in Heaven saying they at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Dont take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord what kind of life is this
Mama I just wanna sing
Mama said according to get everything
you gotta risk everything
So Im smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians

Whats your life about Enlighten me
Is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet
Theres fire in the street fire in my swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
Ive never seen a crop circle
but Ive cops circle the block I puff squares
But I swear one day Ima stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams Uncle Sam aint no killing me
One two three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch fuck the penitentiary

The homie got wet so we tryna soak it in
The president is black but you cant vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify the people they gon peep it universally
We might not change the world but we gon manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot wont you let these cats know
We knew wed be here like back in 04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist em
Were not victors were victims
The bigger picture isnt developed yet
Like what if kids were celibate
Or what is Tammy came across a real man
who didnt play games like children
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriends girlfriend let the world end
And everybody tripping off twentytwelve
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
Odd Futures aight but our futures not
That martial law shit drop we gon all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fastfood use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public work your lil ninetofive
Dont forget to pay your tithes and thank God you alive HiiiPoWeR
And on another note
we focussed like the Hubble Telescope Soul

See a lot of yall dont understand Kendrick Lamar
because you wonder how I could talk about money hoes clothes God and history
all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common
Only half of the truth if you tell it
See I spent twentythree years on this earth searching for answers
till one day I realised I had to come up with my own
Im not on the outside looking in Im not on inside looking out
Im in the dead fucking centre looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
Thats an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money hoes clothes God and history
all in the same sentence
just know I meant it and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
Im not the next pop star Im not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation

I watch this fire that were gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire thats inside you
Section 80 Section 80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No they cant control us no they cant control you
No they cant control us but we control each other
We build our own world
If you dont leave with nothing else tonight you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
or our family
Heart honor and represent

Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80 HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
Im falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengetis clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like its a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig Charlottes Web is gonna miss you
My issue isnt televised and you aint gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat because our lifes an instrumental
This is physical and mental I wont sugarcoat it
Youd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I dont want no plastic nation dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs

Chorus
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Fivestar dishes food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You cant resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Kendrick Lamar
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama I cant turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widows peak uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak uhh
Them demons got me I aint prayed in some weeks uhh
Dear Lord come save me the Devils working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane I need a license
to kill Im standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids write your own hieroglyphs

Chorus
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Fivestar dishes food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is Bobby Seale making meals
You cant resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Every day we fight the system
just to make our way we been down for too long
But thats alright we was built to be strong
cause its our life nananah
Every day we fight the system
We fight the system
We fight the system
Never liked the system
We been down for too long
But thats alright nananah

Kendrick Lamar
Who said a black man in Illuminati
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once Im on that pedestal
Frightening so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill dont sing or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said Bang the drama it bring
is crazy product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water thats why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me lets set it off
Cause a riot throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids write our own hieroglyphs

Chorus
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah nothing less than HiiiPoWeR

I mean the shit is Fred Hampton on your campus
You cant resist his HiiiPoWeR

Chorus Kendrick Lamar

Snatch ya lil secretary bitch for the homies
Blueeyed devil with a fatass monkey

Trunk the hood up two times deuce four
Platinum on errythang platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed homie Ima buy a strap
Straight from the CIA set it on my lap
Take a few M16s to the hood
Pass em all out on the block whats good
Ima put the Compton Swap Meet by the White House
Republican run up get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a milliondollar check like that

Because you make me live forever baby count it all together baby

So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes two chains two cnotes

 The yam is the power that be echoes
 You can smell it when Im walkin down the street
Oh yes we can oh yes we can I can dig rappin
 But a rapper with a ghostwriter what the fuck happened
Oh no  I swore I wouldnt tell
But most of yall share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a twoman cell a twoman cell
Somethins in the water somethins in the water
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then Id rather be a bum than a motherfuckin baller

Chorus

 The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor echoes
 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say

Chorus  minus last bar line

You goatmouthed mammyfucker

Kendrick Lamar
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybodys suicidal they dont even need my help
This shit is elementary Ill probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city everybodys screamin Compton
I should probably run for mayor when Im done to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin out the court buildin woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past twentyfive and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life aint shit but a fat vagina
Screamin Annie are you okay Annie are you okay
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin king

Bitch where was you when I was gunshot
By the time you hear the next pop the funk shall be within you
gunshot Now I run the game got the whole world talkin

Quid pro quo somethin for somethin thats the obvious
Oh shit flows so sick dont you swallow it
Bitin my style youre salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up never lactoseintolerant
The last remainder of real shit you know the obvious
Me scholarship No streets put me through colleges
BE all you can be true but the problem is
A dreams only a dream if work dont follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
Ill tell you my hypothesis Im prolly just way too loyal
KDizzle would do it for you my niggaz think Im a god
Truthfully all of em spoiled usually youre never charged
But somethin came over you once I took you to them fuckin BET Awards
You lookin at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of em
Somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
I shoulda listened what my grandmomma said to me

Chorus Bilal
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass Boooy
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
Oh now slow down

Snoop Dogg
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
He was fivefoot somethin God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said

Kendrick Lamar
Fuck am I sposed to do when Im lookin at walkin licks
The constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
The private jets and passports presidential glass floor
Gold bottles gold models stiffen up the ass for
Instagram flicks suckin dick fuck is this
One more suck away from wavin flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him quickly because he got it
Its the recession then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds
No more livin poor meet my 44
When I see em put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick know they your coworkers
But its gon take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see Im on the clock once that watch landin in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor
Well thats me at these awards I guess my grandmomma was warnin a boy she said

Chorus

Outro Snoop Dogg
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
He was fivefoot somethin dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you cant
take the hood out the homie took his show money
Stashed it in the mozeywozey Hollywoods nervous
Fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service

I remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same

Song   These Walls

woman moaning and groaning

If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 IF THESE WALLS COULD TALLLLK Sex

Anna Wise
She just want to close her eyes and sway
If you if you if you
Exercise your right to work it out
Its true its true its true
Shout out to the birthday girls say hey hey Say hey hey
Aw girl Everyone deserves a night to play play
She plays  only when you tell her no

Chorus Anna Wise Bilal
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reignrain when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when Im in it I love it when Im in it ohh Ohh

Kendrick Lamar
If these walls can talk theyd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket Im not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall tellin me they full of pain resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me Im just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable exclamation
Interior pink color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when Im here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might CRUSH

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
If these walls can talk theyd tell me to go deep
Yellin at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down thats my religion
Walls feelin like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I dont know how long I can wait in these walls
Ive been on these streets too long
Lookin at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ I mustve missed them
Im not involved Id rather diss them
Id rather call on you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon CRUSH

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
If your walls can talk theyd tell you its too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash em on the yard
Take the recipe the Bible and God
Wall tellin you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin no callin CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say youre reputable not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bulllike  a killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin the warden would afford them
THAT SENTENCE SO IMPORTANT
Walls tellin you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusin my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin on a famous rapper
WALLS CAN TALK TALK echoes

I remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
 Sometimes I did the same abusing my power full of resentment
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room

I place blame on you still place shame on you still
Feel like you aint shit feel like you dont feel
confidence in yourself breakin on marble floors
Watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that Im yours
But you aint shit Im convinced your tolerance nothin special
What can I blame you for Nigga I can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
A baby inside just a teenager wheres your patience
Wheres your antennas where is the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100000 but never reached her
I fuckin tell you you fuckin failure YOU AINT NO LEADER
I never liked you forever despise you I DONT NEED YOU
The world dont need you dont let them deceive you
Numbers lie too fuck your pride too thats for dedication
Thought money would change you made you more complacent
I fuckin hate you I hope you embrace it I swear

Lovin you is complicated what I got to to do to get to you To get to you

Kendrick Lamar  in drunk cracky voice
Are you the reason why momma and nem leavin
No you aint shit you say you love em I know you dont mean it
I know youre irresponsible selfish in denial cant help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden everyone felt it
Everyone heard it multiple shots corners cryin out
You was deserted where was your antennas again
Where was yo presence where was yo support that you pretend
You aint no brother you aint no disciple you aint no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Lil brother you promised youd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas On the road bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time thats unforgiven
You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover well
Third surgery they couldnt stop the bleeding for real
Then he died God himself will say You fuckin failed You aint try

sniffling

I know yo secrets nigga mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin on yo heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys aint been speakin nigga
Yall damn near beefin I seen it and youre the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk deep swig
I cry myself to sleep bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin to pieces earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know yo secrets dont let me tell them to the world
about that shit you thinkin and that time you swig Im bout to hurl
Im fucked up but I aint as fucked up as you
You just cant get right I think yo heart made of bulletproof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda felt that black Revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say You GOTTA go
And if I told your secrets the worldll know money cant stop a suicidal weakness

Reapin everything I sow so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing so my record
And my motherfuckin gang stands silence for the record uih
Tell the world I know its too late
Boys and girls I think Ive gone crazy
Drown inside my vices all day

PreChorus
Wouldnt you know we been hurt been down before nigga

 Kendrick Lucy dont slack a minute Lucy work harder
 Lucy gon call ya even when Lucy know you love your Father

 Truly Lucy dont mind cause at the end of the day youll pursue me

Oh SHIT I need that I need dat sloppy that sloppy Yo
Like a Chevy in quicksand Yeah that sloppy

So it seeeeeeeeems

Kendrick Lamar
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap West West West
We dont share the same synonym fall back West West West
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimickin radios nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
Visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
Gamblin Benjamin benefits sinnin in traffic
Spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
Winnin in every decision Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isnt it lovely how menaces turned attraction
Pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writin blue magic
Thank God for rap I would say it got me a plaque
But whats better than that The fact it brought me back home

Chorus
We been waitin for you Waitin for you
Waitin for you waitin for you

Kendrick Lamar
I know everything I know everything know myself
I know morality spirituality good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you I know everything
I know Compton I know street shit I know shit thats conscious
I know everything I know lawyers advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom I know bad religion I know good karma
I know everything I know history I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isnt meant for me
I know everything I know cars clothes hoes and money
I know loyalty I know respect I know those thats ornery
I know everything the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if Im generous at heart I dont need recognition
The way Im rewarded well thats Gods decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids dont gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life Im knowin how much its worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didnt know shit the day I came home

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro gap in his smile
Handmedown sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin new laws momma passed on home trainin
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 Oh I forgot Dont Kill My Vibe thats right youre famous
 I used to watch on Channel 5 TV was taken
 But never mind youre here right now dont you mistake it
 Its just a new trip take a glimpse at your familys ancestor
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
 And that was bullshit I mean your life is full of turmoil
 You spoiled by fantasies of who you are I feel bad for you
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
 If you resist Ill back off quick go catch a flight or two
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace
 Then be an advocate tell your homies especially to come back home

beat stops then changes

Is it in a woman is it in money or mankind
Tell me somethin think Im losin my mind ha
I say where you at from the front to the back
Im lookin for you I react only when you react
Ha I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the 38 special
Maybe youre in a dollar bill maybe youre not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel song starts to fade
Maybe Im paranoid ha maybe I dont need you anyway
Dont lie to me Im suicidal anyway I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

Kendrick Lamar
I dont give a fuck about no politics in rap my nigga

So you better go hard every time you jump on wax my nigga
FUCK what they talkin bout yo shit is where its at my nigga
Came in this game you stuck yo fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game yo hood yo name in this game
Now you double up time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin to the scripts now hip them Benjamins gon cuddle up
Skip  hop  drip  drop
Flip  flop with the white tube sock
It goes Sherrrrm Sticks burrrrrrn this
Thats what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute out the Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos Monte Carlos Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz PFunkers Mexicans they FUCK with you
Asians they FUCK with you nobody cant FUCK with you

Chorus

Hopped out the Caddy just got my dick sucked
The little homies called they said The enemies done cliqued up
Oh YEAH Puto want to squabble with mi barrio
Oh YEAH Tell em they can run it for the cardio
Oh YEAH Everything is everything its scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin scramblin football numbers slanderin
Niggaz name on paper you snitched all summer
Streets dont fail me now
They tell me its a new gang in town
From Compton  to Congress set trippin all around
Aint nothin new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state which one you governin
They give us guns and drugs call us thugs make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you Obama say What it Do
OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Everybody wanna talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack or who white and who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hiphop was rappin
Motherfucker if you did then Killer Miked be platinum
Yall priorities fucked up put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic my memory been gone since
Dont ask about no camera blockin at award shows
No dont ask about my bitch no dont ask about my foes
Less you askin me about power yeah I got a lot of it
Im the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby K Dot what up I heard they opened up
 Pandoras box I box em all in by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sittin down with Jay
He said Its funny how one verse could fuck up the game

Outro
I been A1 since day one you niggaz booboo

I remembered you was conflicted misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same abusing my power full of resentment
  Resentment that turned into a deep depression
  Found myself screamin in the hotel room
  I didnt wanna selfdestruct the evils of Lucy was all around me
  So I went runnin for answers until I came home
  But that didnt stop survivors guilt
  Going back and forth trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
  Or maybe how A1 my foundation was
  But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city
  I was entering a new one

Kendrick Lamar
How much a dollar really cost
The question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling yall
Gotta see how Im chillin once I park this luxury car
Hoppin out feeling big as Mutombo twenty on pump six dirty
Marcellus called me Dumbo twenty years ago cant forget
Now I can lend em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold the liberal concept that what menll do
Twentyohsix he didnt hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu my American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station a homeless man with a semitan complexion
Asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land
Deep water powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted I knew he was smokin
He begged and pleaded asked me to feed him twice I didnt believe it
Told him Beat it contributin money just for his pipe I couldnt see it
He said My son temptation is one thing that Ive defeated
Listen to me I want a single bill from you  nothin less nothin more
I told him I aint have it then closed my door tell me how much a dollar cost

Chorus James Fauntleroy
All you neeeeed is more to feed your mind
Water sun and love the one you love
All you need the air you breathe

Kendrick Lamar
Hes starin at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin hes starin at me I grab my key
Hes starin at me I started the car then I tried to leave
And somethin told me to keep it in park until I can see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like Im the reason hes homeless and askin ME for a favor
Hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
Hes starin at me I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now Im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck
I never understood someone beggin for goods
Askin for handouts takin it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14
 A humble man is all that we ever need tell me how much a dollar cost

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Guilt trippin and feelin resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
Sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
I should distance myself I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here who the fuck Im kiddin
So Ima tell you like I told the last bum crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines and I recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
I got better judgment I know when niggaz hustlin
Keep in mind when I was strugglin I did compromise
Now I comprehend I smell grandpas old medicine
reekin from your skin moonshine and gin
Nigga youre babblin your words aint flatterin Im imaginin
Denzel but lookin at ONeal Kazaam your sad thrills
Your gimmick is mediocre the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin focus
And Im insensitive and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said Your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said Every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said Know the truth itll set you free
 Youre lookin at the Messiah the son of Jehovah the higher power
 The choir that spoke the word the Holy Spirit the nerve
 Of Nazareth and Ill tell you just how much a dollar cost
 The price of having a spot in Heaven embrace your loss I am God

Outro Ronald Isley
I wash my hands I said my grace
What more do you want from me

Even if massa listenin I got the worlds attention
So Imma say somethin thats vital and critical for survival

Beauty is what you make it I used to be so mistaken

Thats the real Blues baby like you met Jays baby

You think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my solemn men up north 12 Years a Slave
12 years of age thinkin my shade too dark
I love myself I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light dont mean you smart bein dark dont make you stupid
And frame of mind for them Bustas aint talkin WOOHAH
Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored
Like two ties LL you lose two times
If you dont see youre beautiful in your complexion
It aint complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite uh thats the context
Yeah baby Im conscious aint no contest
If you like it I love it all your earth tones been blessed
Aint no stress jiggaboos wanna be
I aint talkin Jay mmmmm I aint talkin B
Im talkin Daze we got School watchin movie screens
And Spike your self esteem the new James Bond gon be black as me
Black as brown hazelnut cinnamon black tea
And its all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team blues and pirus no colors aint a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
 Teenage gun toters that dont play fair should I get out the car
 I dont see Compton I see something much worse
 The land of the landmines the hell thats on earth

But homie you made me
Black dont crack my nigga

Kendrick Lamar
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin this way since I was 16 came to my senses
You never liked us anyway fuck your friendship I meant it
Im AfricanAmerican
Im African Im black as the moon heritage of a small village pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
You hate me dont you You hate my people
Your plan is to terminate my culture youre fuckin evil
I want you to recognize that Im a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but cant take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
Im guardin my feelings  I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community makin a killin
You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry the bigger I shoot

Chorus Assassin
I said they treat me like a slave cah me black
Woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah we black
And man a say they put me in a chain cah we black
Imagine now big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip Left scars pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon the block
All dem a say we doomed from the start cah we black
Remember this every race start from the Black
Just remember that

Kendrick Lamar
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean its evident that Im irrelevant to society
Thats what youre tellin me penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me til Im dead
Church me with your fake prophesizin that Ima be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me dont you I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin me as I pull up fill up my tank then peel out
Muscle cars like pullups show you what these big wheels bout
Ah black and successful this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch how can I help you
How can I tell you Im makin a killin
You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

Interlude

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me its generational hatred
Its genocism its grimy little justification
Im AfricanAmerican
Im African Im black as the heart of a fuckin Aryan
Im black as the name of Tyrone and Darius excuse my French
But fuck you no fuck yall Thats as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me dont you You hate my people
I can tell cause its threats when I see you I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because youre in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin maliciously he get a chain then you gon bleed him
Its funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin with Pirus only death settle the score
So dont matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State Marcus Garvey got all the answers
Or try to celebrate February like its my Bday
Or eat watermelon chicken and KoolAid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
when gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me
Hypocrite

Song   You Aint Gotta Lie Momma Said

Intro
Study long study wrong nigga
Hey yall close that front door yall let flies in this muhfucker
Close that door My OG up in this muherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand ackin a fool
Hey hey babe check it out Ima tell you what my mama had said she like

Kendrick Lamar
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin Oh you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness aint the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk we know that its all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

Bridge
Askin where the hoes at to impress me
Askin where the moneybags to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
Its all in your head homie
Askin where the plug at to impress me
Askin where the jug at to impress me
Askin where its at only upsets me
You sound like the feds homie

Chorus
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard

Kendrick Lamar
And the world dont respect you
and the culture dont accept you but you think its all love
And the girls gon neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation cant protect you if you never had one
Jealousy complex emotional complex
Selfpity complex under oath complex
The loudest one in the room nigga thats a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

Chorus  Bridge

Kendrick Lamar
What do you got to offer
Tell me before we off ya put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction tell me just who your boss is
Niggaz be fugazi bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi niggaz and bitches
who make habitual lyin babies bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me you can never relate me
to him him to her her or that that or them them
Or you you the truth truth you love love to bend bend
In the back back in the bed bed on the floor thats yo ho
On the couch couch in her mouth mouth Ill be out really doe
See loud rich niggaz got low money
And loud broke niggaz got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel

Finna run into a building lay my body

fight breaks out in the crowd

Interlude Kendrick Lamar

Kendrick Lamar  acapella
I promised Dave Id never use the phrase fuck nigga
He said Think about what you sayin fuck niggas
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats
Sound like I needed some soul searchin
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So Im a dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous sensitive Nword control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
NEGUS definition royalty
King royalty  wait listen
NEGUS description black emperor
King ruler now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies dont recognize we be using it wrong
So Ima break it down and put my game in the song
NEGUS say it with me
Or say no more black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey tell her she right on time

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan onetwo onetwo
Uh when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message

Wont you look to your left and right Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan

Kendrick Lamar
Do you believe in me Are you deceivin me
Could I let you down easily Is your heart where it need to be
Is your smile on permanent Is your vow on lifetime
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line
If Im tried in a court of law if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K Lamar
or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind youre very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song its surely a blessing
But a prophet aint a prophet til they ask you this question

Interlude

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Kendrick Lamar
Do you believe in me How much you believe in her
You think she gon stick around if them 25 years occur
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt
You think yall on common ground if you promise to be there first
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time
Like who got your best interest Like how much are you dependent
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretendin
How tough is your skin when they turn you in Do you show forgiveness
What brush do you bend when dustin your shoulders from bein offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissin
What kind of bridge did they burn Revenge on your mind when its mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peacemakin seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone this your lesson for everyone say

Interlude

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The voice of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin with me nigga

Kendrick Lamar
I been wrote off before I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges dont let me resent you
Thats not Nelsonlike want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robbens Island analyzin thats where his cell is
So I could find clarity like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be
See I got to question it all family friends fans cats dogs
Trees plants grass how the wind blow
Murphys Law generation X will I ever be your X
Floss off a baby step mauled by the mouth of pitbulls put me under stress
Crawled under rocks ducking yall its respect
But then tomorrow put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left em for dead
Is it Moses Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red
Is it Martin Luther JFK shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie Is it Jesse Oh I know its Michael Jackson
Oh when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
That nigga gave us Billie Jean you say he touched those kids
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin with me nigga let me ask this question nigga

I seen it vividly joggin my brain memory
Life no I seen it vividly joggin my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final callin
No birds chirpin or flyin no dogs barkin
We all nervous and cryin movin in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet crackin and crumblin
The ground is shakin swallowin young woman
With a baby daisies and other flowers burnin in destruction
The smell is disgustin the heat is unbearable
Preachers touchin on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust famous screamin in agony
Atheists for suicide planes fallin out the sky
Trains jumpin off the track mothers yellin Hes alive
Backpedalin Christians settlin for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out fire burnin more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom college classrooms been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
Its happenin No more runnin from world wars
Its happenin No more discriminatin the poor
Its happenin No more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishin for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly a moniker of war 
from Heaven that played the symphony thunder like number four
Then I heard What have you did for me I fell to my knees
Pulled out my resume that dated back to June 17th
1987 my paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to Hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that Id excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you say I didnt try for you
Say I didnt ride for you I tithed for you
I pushed the club to the side for you who love you like I love you 
Crucifix tell me you can fix
Anytime I need Ima start jottin everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me always camaraderie
I can see our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearin the last trumpet
All man child woman life completely went in reverse
I guess Im runnin in place tryin to make it to church

Outro
Young nigga act an ass

What did the Asian say A peace of mind
Thats what the Asian said I need a divine
intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believin in Buddha me believin in God
Asked him What are you doin he said Takin my time
Meditation is a must it dont hurt if you try
See you thinkin too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career you ever think of your health
What did the Indian say A piece of land
Thats what the Indian said I needed demand
Tellin me longevitys in the dirt should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best really you should invest
These tangible things expire dont you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage we blessed
Now what the black man say A piece of pussy
Thats what the black man said I needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a wool we like to live in the jungle
Like to play in the peach what you sayin to me
He said Nigga come back to reality for a week
Pussy is power fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldnt be prouder you should allow it
What the white man say A piece of mines
Thats what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Tellin me that he sellin me just for 1099
If I go platinum from rappin I do the company fine
What if I compromise He said it dont even matter
You make a million or more you living better than average
You losin your core followin gainin it all
He put a price on my talent I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
Ima make you some promises that you just cant ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I dont target your market
If you aint signin your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are givin their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your masters mortgage
I need a piece

Tell em when you went to the park and everybody came back and
And welfare dont mean well for you you you you

Do you believe in God If you dont its cool

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world toooo me
And that means the world to me

Kendrick Lamar
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular Im drunk
How can I can make them popular Pop em when I want
See Im livin with anxiety duckin the sobriety
Fuckin up the system I aint fuckin with society
Justice aint free therefore justice aint me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now Im thinkin to myself hollow tips is all I got
Now Im drinkin by myself at the intersection parked
Watched you when you walked inside your house you threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creepin through your fuckin door and blowin out
every piece of your brain til your son jumped in your arms
Cut on the engine then sped off in the rain Im gone

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin the handle

Punch
Lit off Henny Im tryna dismantle
These wicked ways Ive engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel
Wait thats a bit ambitious maybe Im trippin
Maybe Im crazy maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
Its such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still dont recognize my flaws
I guess Im lost the cost of bein successful
is equal to bein neglectful I pray my experience helps you
As for me Im tryna sort it out
Searchin for loopholes in my bruised soul but who knows
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key so I am king

Anna Wise
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh

The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton they tell me that Im blind
I know that Im intelligence my confidence just died

Jay Rock
Carpe diem seize the day I cant compromise
A tapeworm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets they seein me as I pacify
But couldnt fathom the meanin of seein sacrifice

Kendrick Lamar
Im passin lives on a daily maybe Im losin faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why Im awake

Jay Rock
Im sleep walkin Im street stalkin Im out of place
Reinforcin this heat barkin these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates
Or this is just a mirage or a facade Wait

Chorus Kendrick Lamar  CeeLo Green
Oh But dont be scared of me girl I can explain
I know its foreign to you I know its hard to believe
God give me the favor let me explain
More than a compliment and I could use some assistance
Let me show you how I can explain
Oh oh shando I spin around two times
Ill be there with the answer let me explain

CeeLo Green
Im bizarre avantgarde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
Its attractive youre intrigued
Am I Mortal Man or make believe
Anything you want I can explain I can explain it
Any misunderstandings baby let me explain I can explain it
Why dont you sit and talk to me awhile I can explain let me explain it
Ahhhh yes let me explain

Kendrick Lamar
My momma told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby no Im not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways praise the Lord
You teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant I mean we
love a woman and think we can satisfy her between sheets
Covers and pillows
Im promisin your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
Im promisin that Im acknowledgin you as my hero cause you believe in me
No youre not easily impressed but I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws look at my flaws look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And thats alright because I like it you and me are the same
Hopefully Im invited hopefully you dont change

Chorus Kendrick Lamar  CeeLo Green
Because I know for sure who you are I can explain
Your momma raised you your daddy raised you
Hand washin your clothes on Sunday let me explain
Walking your brother to school
Three miles away to feed him knowledge so I can explain
Dont you explain that
Dont you explain the reason why your mind it travels let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you but dont you EVER let me explain
Oh oh shando I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise I can explain
I know for sure who you are
Youre the goddess of the odd I am yours I can explain
I am yours I am yours I am yours
I am yoooours yoooours yoooours

Kendrick Lamar
Yeah yeah young Egypt
Look look

I feel like Pacino in Godfather Im charged
Our Father who art in Heaven Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin the odds
What an accomplishment broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like yall fear God
You sound frantic I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of makin your choice and writin your bars
Before you poke out your chest loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital
Avenues lookin like evil dead zombies with batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin my stock rise
The salary the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid just premium gas do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags look at my photo
Black excellence pessimist died countin my coin
Hope its evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar
on youth centers buildings and Beamers and blue leather
Forecasted my future this is the future
The mastermind until my next album more power to you gunshot

Kendrick Lamar
Why so sad

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
Walkin around with them blue faces
She said Im down on my luck
And its somethin I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them Color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breakin me down honey

Kendrick Lamar
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
Uh but I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I reup
See I barely have patience and youre relatin
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
You plead the fifth I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut my success Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute Now why you so sad

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you woman I console you woman
You feel like the universe owes you woman
Oh the anticipation of hopin you could make it
Bitches dont prosper chasin education
But youre talented and cant handle it
And your homegirls cant be your manager
365 times four plus more
If ya cant get it right tell me do you got the stamina
But shit aint no money like fast money
Even today Im considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasin stardom how can I fast forward
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I wrote this song lookin at a broke home baby broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies broke boy and babies
Somebody yell Kendrick American they sho is crazy
And I said Why Then he looked me in the eye

And said Nigga you fucked up youre bankin on good luck
You wishin for miracles you never been through shit
Youre cryin hysterical you settle for everythin
Complain about everythin you say you sold crack my world amphetamine
Your projects aint shit I live in a hut bitch
Im livin to keep warm you livin to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waitin on Allah
You played your way through by livin in scifi
Bullshittin yourself you talkin to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When yall came on the boat lookin for hope
And all you can say is that youre lookin for dope
These days aint no compromise
And your pain aint mines half the time
A brand new excuse aint shit to me
Bitch I made my moves with shackled feet
Cape Town

Interlude
In todays day and age
We practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them him and her
But when a blessing takes too long thats when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker why so sad

Verse 1
Your attention please your attention I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it
Where Im seated is scenic
Heavyweighter slim as the Machinist so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
Im in the market for lowmile 360 Modenas
And a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your cars always pitted
We should call it Stanley Steamers
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Ghenghis Khan
But without the Ye but his last names my side
I ride with the meanest
Im armed to the teeth
Youre Venus and youve never been to the Dinasdentist
School of Hard Knocks I dean it
I done it as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus and my names on the arenas
But you cant bring it to my court not even with subpoenas
Cause you cant play my sport but you can still cheerlead us
And you cant sit there that sections for the seniors
And the sexy senoritas so just move up to the bleachers
How you going to school me when I grew up with your teachers
I know that you cant hear me
Cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging
Cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the impastas
And I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card
And I maxed out all the Visas
Accreditation so prestigious
Just walk across my stage
Your life will be completed
Dont need financial aid
Cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared
Throw your hats up in the air
Im red hot Chilly Im Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage
And Chitowns feeling excellent
We hit them with the President
See we set the precedent
I dont feel Im best
I just feel Im better than

Hook Thom Yorke
Everyone everyone around here
Everyone is so near
So alone so alone

Verse 2
See I dont disagree
This is just a grievance
This aint dissent
This is civil disobedience
How you going to make hiphop
Without all the ingredients
Lot of mouths to feed
Plus a lot of greediness
And that greed outshines the neediness
What niggas need is some question they authority
And tune out all the TV shit
And we be this
So I give them more
You see I did it for

Hook

Verse 3
Yeah I am back up on the airwaves
Feeling like a Soldier and I aint talking where the Bears play
Flair look how I Fred Astaire down the staircases
Its finna be a hairraising tortoise versus hare race
So you should hang around here like some earrings
I know attentions all about how you pair things
So when I want them to hear me out
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And whats written on her titties is what its really about
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan Iraq
Health care hair driveby thighs
Education lips HIV eyes
Environment feet
Justice get her so wet brains get you brains
You can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face finish listening to the tape
Enemy of the State

Verse 1
Microphone check I make them all bounce
Every teller in Bank of America make them all count
You gone need the whole staff to add up the amount
Its going to take to pay me off to keep me out your house
To keep me in my zone so that I dont zone out
Im Rich and Po like Zone 4 thoughts is deep like Tone Loc
Walk with me like old folk cross your street a scores goaled
I dont rap I hockey rink cause my flow is so cold
I am on my mmhmm they are on they Oh No
I am really in herehair they aint real like Soul Glo
Dont you know Im so sure them niggas got no glow
Find a master fore you can come back into the dojo
Lupe got his mind right nigga this is my mic
And Ive come to take it all back like Miller High Life
He must not be tied tight back against the wall
He will throw a ball like he playing Jai Alai
Ill do the register you just get them fries right
I dont trust America after watching Zeitgeist
Take a look at my stripes chest looks like a tiger arm
And Im hot as tiger balm fire like a fivealarm
And its set to Tire Barn Get your firefighter on
I aint worried about you hoeshose I dont even need to roll
I turn down your ex like how you put your tires on
Once I get these tires on I buy a bomb and tie it on
And ride this around the entire song find a line to drive it on
Park it near a metaphor wait for it the timers on
You can turn your hydrants on Ill just turn my wipers on
Wipe it off then wipe me down but dont forget about my bomb

Meditate on the floor fold your legs resonate
Breathing speed regulate clear my mind till it levitate
Dhalsim I beat the game level 8 hella good
Never great cause God is great so aint no goats aint no gates
Fences see the rams ram lambs let sheeps skate
Brace yourself teeth straight fix your face for Petes sake
Birthday wordplay piece of cake fold the flow with seats for eight
Ororo Munroe make it rain not with bills I make it change
Take that cool shit make it lame take that nerd shit make it bang
Yeah you heard us make it bang yeah ya heard me make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring take that ring  make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains so I had to use some bling
Shouts to Drizzy shout to Wayne Yeezy Jeezy Ricky Fifty
Raekwon Loso Gucci Mane Im not going to drop my name
Sneak that message to the masses you can call me Chocolate Rain
You might think my wallet drained look how far my pockets hang
Thats cause I got pocket change my net worth is basketball
They net worth is soccer games tell them niggas stop it mane
But they cannot stop it mane so they forced to watch it drain
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans
King without the whoppers and King without the cobbler
And King and I aint got no dreams Bruce Lee dishwasher
Cleaning out your pots and pans these niggas aint got no stain
Power once I hit them with the powder
Then throw em in the shower
These niggas slower than some dialup
I be on my broadband these niggas still downloadin
Lu finished you still up on YouSendIt uShare
ZShare how long you going to be there Damn
FinallyFastcom for you fam
Information super highway these niggas aint got no lane
But you can ride my shoulder like they pulled you over
I sit in the drivers seat you sit on the sofa
I am Patrick Swayze you are Whoopi Goldberg
Cause he was a beast in the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick rest in peace to Stacks kid
Rest in peace to rap no rest in peace to wackness
Yeah nigga I whacked it

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
I see diamond flooded demons Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Windows up system bumping you the one they sang to
Same two who said they the ones you should send your thanks through
Pockets full of blessings they can sanctify and saint you
You can hear them revvingreverend up in heaven now cant you
Sandals made of chrome his soul made of leather
An engine full of sinning and candy painted feathers
The sound of the motor only revvingreverend you confess to
I see this all in the eyes of the girl Im next to
I asked her Where we going and she just told me Pleasure
Hands on the wheel and her heels on the acceler
rator told her wait up she kept going like et cetera
Or like a broken record weve come too far to just wheel it back selector
So we going ride forever forever forever forever forever

Diddy
Its that Dirty Money
Came from heaven just to sing a song for you
To the rhythm of my love for you and now its beatin slow
And you know this the ennnnd of the road
When I sing that slow song for you
And love was nothin but another gun for you nother gun for you
And I would hide it in my helpless soul
Im not afraid to go down the road where we go
I dont know you can hear em callin dont you
When the angels call like

Hook Diddy Dawn
You
If you dont wanna stay you can go oh
It seems love dont live here no more
The angels are flyin so loooow singin to you
Dont you hear me callin you
Hes the one you love cause I hear em callin me
And hes the one you trust like our time is almost through
Time is runnin out Theres nothin left to do
When theyre callin you
When the angels call like I answeeeeer

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Uh said she was a fan of mine
Knew she was New Jersey but said that she was Anaheim
Butterflies turn to suicides now its phantoms flying
Used to whisper in my ear but now she trying to Vander mine
That holy feelingHolyfield all gone slowly feeling all wrong
None of this is satisfying pull it over let me out
Ill just hitchhike back to mine
Nothings really as it seems yeah I should of known that
Thought I called a angel devils had my phones tapped

This ones for Chilly Chill Food and Liquor flow
Strong like its been distilled by
Hillbillies in the hills and we move down to Beverly
So heavenly waking niggas up like Reveille
We wont be going back to you regularly so forget it
Shadow flow colder than Punxsutawney Phillip
My minds on dope my brains on skillets
Thoroughly trained to just bang off lyrics
Bang bang bang like Pops Wayans
Witherspoon or with a fork was coming out my egg like Mork
Deserves his own head on Rushmore
Flood the game like a giant in a dwarfs shorts
So long niggas career so short
It should be riding on a horse mines is a horse
But mines is the size you could sneak inside a fort
Yours is a pony it could sleep inside a Porsche
I am on point like the eating side of forks
So keep your head down like your reflection in a spoon
Chilly Chill will be out of corrections real soon

Verse Lupe Fiasco
We just gonna keep it going and going
Until I feel completed and happy about it you know
Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man
Brewster Place he used to stick his scissors in his sockets damn
Clear that Project Runway
Cause this is where my rocket lands
Aint got no problems Houston
I AKA then rocket land
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans
Rockets and I up in the sky like helicopter cams
And you down there in the traffic jam
From here Ive seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrestling fans
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam zoom
Now Im like the biggest G up in the room
Still hard to see me like the truth on TV
Or the roof from the sidewalk
I dont flow I ceiling
My mama said they need me
Cause Im made from the best stuff on earth
Like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full so I spit into them like Celie
No longer G now you can see me
But your letters still under my sea like seaweed
C and G but nothing bout me CG
Its all real none of this is green screen
Shut Up and Let Me Go just like The Ting Tings
Im feeling like a Mac
Standing around a bunch of PCs
Ive rocked it from the shottas to the soccer moms
Try to stop whats going on
Youll see the back of my hand like the tops of palms
Im balling like the tops of pawns
Circle of influence getting bigger like the ripples on the tops of ponds
Surefooted and War Headed like the tops of bombs
Dominoin niggas
Delivery is Papa Johns Little Caesars
Burning down your Pizza Hut
Plaque collection building cause
I dont brush my teeth enough
Yeah Crack is wack and reefer sucks
You might think this deep as fuck
But this is like my weaker stuff
They ask is this his daytoday cause this is like a week to us
Mic is shy and speakers blush
I is shy and he is up
I correct me is up
No we is up  cause its like two of me
And each of us rapping acid eat this up
ATown down peace is up
New York to East Coast is cuffed
West Side riding
Lot of niggas salty cause
Cause I be overseas and tough
Everything seamless WorldStar never seen this
NahRight gotta stream this mother fucking genius
Brave and fly you backboneless and wingless
Bunch of chickens on the strip
Im coming for they fingers
Till what they throwing up is meaningless
Chilly Chill you seeing this
This didnt make MTVs list
Finish fingers eating wrist feeding frenzy and shit
Succotash suffering
ChickenFrikaseeen this
A beat eating media blitz
Pace is getting feverish
Pain is growing Seaverish
These the peppers Peter picked
Things are at their easiest
Real Compton city Gin it

Im just a wolf inside a lions suit
A shark shirt a panthers pants piranha hat and tiger shoes
I got a lions den inside the booth
That right there is point blank
This here is from where the sniper shoot
Might take a long time to get it by the time I hit it
I done ran Bubble Tape around them Chiclets poof
I aint the bomb Im the company that got the contract
To rebuild during the aftermath  have a blast
Going green only using half the gas
The calming comes through after disasters have
But this calm has the same fury that disasters have
I should have a class Im the sonsun of the South Pole plus Alaskas dad
Got niggas like DAG flow is like crazy gone mad
And villains gone bad Punk ass niggas dont be so Daft
Baby why you hanging with them Busters like Babs
They are such a drag you should move them to the trash
Feel like Im walking round upon Cassius calves
Quite a beautiful script and such a gift of gab
A big Bay shout out to Mistah FAB
Young Frankenstein reporting live from the lab
I bought the bars out put it on my tab
If you came here to box youll leave in a bag
I run the game Bilderberg Group in the lead with the flash
Usain Bolt aint even leaving this fast
Why you take offense with your defensive ass

And a couple Billy Blanks TaeBo Karate kicks
If you aint Million Dollar Dreaming then we opposites
In high school I was voted the most Ted DiBiaseest
Also the most slept on cause my Ted DiBiaseness
An Inglorious Basterd and you looking like a Nazi bitch
They say its hard out here for old boy then tell me where Taraji is
I am going so raw watch me Soy Sauce Wasabi this
Nobunoble on them ProTools hot as HE double hockey sticks
Make sure you give the chef your compliments
And thank him for his constantly great tasting accomplishments
A smiley face emoticons if you want to remain anonymous

Its Hirst verses and Murakami rhyming
All my raps is superflat all your raps is super wack
Tell him that the futures back DeLorean rolling down the block
You can call it shooting craps and my roof is back
And my wings is up
Kingda Ka without Kahlua so you aint got to pour the king a cup
Young Yakuza but none of my fingers cut
So I can still sip Red Zinger with my pinkies up
Made man you can call this cleaning up
Im OCD I never think its clean enough
Thats what defines me I never think its mean enough
Lines deeper than those waiting on a sneaker cuz
You gone need two heads like the King of Clubs just to figure out the meaning of
Im just achieving buzz so stay out of son way like youre drinking blood
This is what it feels like to be in love

Verse 2
I mean come on I mean look at what Im dropping here
Do this for the block and the blogosphere
No you aint ready for the heavy so Ill keep it light as jogging gear
I dont want the throne I want the helicopter rocking chair
Jay gave me a cosign like I was RocaWear but be clear Im not the heir
Im the water fire and the earth
That means Im doing dirt spitting flames and quenching thirst
And plus the real God has been on my side since birth
I hope that he forgives me I hope I do his work in every single verse

And fastforwards bullets makina Bline for my face
Then they stop like Neo
Laugh at me throw some cash at me then fly pass me
But one ricochets off the wall to come back and ask me
Am I scared of him or the nigga that blast me
Or maybe just the hammer that goes to be a hole in an innocent bystander
My eyes a camera my ears a microphone
My mind is Pro Tools my head is a stool
Whats recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone
My mouth is a speaker Im anchoring the misery
Theres no friends the enemy of my enemy is my enemy
Beakers and test tubes full of memories
In my labatory I create stories
Doze off then wake up surrounded by Forties
Wit Glocks tucked in they labels
And they caps is baseball hats
Playin poker at a table
Cigarettes massage they shoulders in belly tops showin off they navels
A dime sack side bets a tech is runnin for president
Jesus pieces walk around with niggas hangin from they necks
Monopoly is playin chess
I just picked up an obituary of a bullet proof vest
Put the headphone on my mouth speak into my ears
Yea microphone check check check check check
Check a pair of Air Forces told me Rimsve been extinct for years
Been ethnic cleansed by Jerseys tryna take over the set
And Television is on deathrow for killing BET and MTV over a dice game
And paralyizing CNN by knifing him in the neck
I hear Clear Channels been fightin him in the rec
Whos in for givin grape KoolAid laced with strychnine to mixtapes and arm robbin cassettes
Dope told me Weed was a crack fiend but Crack told me that Dope was a base head
Hihats told police he was just a soldier he did what the Bass said
The Snare and the Kick didnt make it out alive
The Sample made it out with some money but he died in the ride
The 808 got caught wit some work He aint never comin home
So the MPCs and the MP3s is fightin over his turf
Sean Don just gave birth
But shes thinkin bout leavin it on the doorstep of a church
Cristal cant have kids she plottin to kidnap it that she orchestrated with a purse
But Gucci told Fendi and Fendi turned and around and told Henny
And Henny is Moets babys father
But she tried it anyway disguised as a nurse
In the newspapers it says HipHop called Rock n Roll racist
The Six ripped the Five and the Maybach taped it
A Hundred dollar bill just signed a record deal
But he blew all his money on the Braceletes
And givin the Gold Dollar a face lift
A Button Up just drove by in a 64 Impalla
All the Rolexs is hatin you see the smirks on they faces
The Havatampas is defending the Dutchess they keep catchin cases
But the judge is a Swisha he just give em iBonds and community service with the Papers
So the Newports is gettin mad at the ZigZags then out come the razors
See the Kools is killers on the creep
Rush up on the Philly leave his guts spillin on the street
Some Gold Grills burned down the building of some teeth
Some Sharpened Tooth Brushes is holding the trampoline cuz some children finna to leap
I just seen Rocawear rock Sean John to sleep with the same heat that Baby Phat carried
Sprint is pimpin Nextel she just gave head to a Black Berry
I heard she go twoways
But he was skeetin on her face as it was beepin on my waist

Grew up in Chicago West side gang lifestyle the drug scene the whole its like one whole universe of insanity

Verse 1
Before I start like to make sure Im smart
Gather my composure rather my swagger and my culture
Pivot my fitted then begin to rivet with a change of lyric
In other words I reposition how I sit it
Then make you feel it like I mispronounced filet
On second thought I cant make you fill it
Like you digging your own grave unless you can Kill Bill it
A night of the living passed away
Can you dig it Why Emcee Hey
I do it for my village
The pennin is John Lennon the beat is the Beatles
Go together like Lenin and the people
In some fresh linens and some John Lennons fresh outta Seagles

Verse 2
Im back at cha and I Pac like cap backwards
Like a hats backwards you know when the bats backwards
Yeah like a bat catchers
The law gotta long arm like a back scratcher
But before I leave mine at home
Like a bad catcher I think about my zone
Where pimps make scratch off the track like a DJ
Easy thats my zone rappers
Its my deck
And if I catch u set trippin wit my cassette sittin in a zone rappers
Its not a threat
Cuz itll span ya where I roam rappers where I hone my skills
They wanna send me back home the devil is on my heels
The writing is Sting liken the sequences the Police I repeat
We go together like the Beauty and the Beast
Writing is in my veins
The ink is the diesel the pen and the needles

Writing and mumbling upcoming verse

The word is mightier than the sword
And my serve is tightier than yours
Like year in St Louis ya whole flow
I fear I sank through it
It all became clear
Like a paramedic with an electric chest kit YEAH
The gravity of the vocabulary is a caliber equal to Excalibur
Swung wit the grace of Agassi in his amateurs THERE
There was a deeper depth dont know how I got here
I also had a hole in my flow
It appears I sank to it
My swing it couldnt be seen
I apply some paint to it the invisible man
Wrapped in bandages in critical CLEAR

Knockin At The Door
Lupe Fiasco
Album Fahrenheit 115 Part I The Truth Is Among Us
  
Verse 1
They wanna start again no arguing
Guns in the car for them
Hit em while they feet on they ottomans
Off guard uh huh blow em out they cardigans
They case hardening they at the table bargaining
No time for stuck safeties or shaky targeting
Hit the face hit the safe and the carpet and
Get the weight get the cake get the tape that we starred in
Escape hit the interstate partying
They guardians is soft frames as jellyfish
Give em shirts they can strain spaghetti with
Extra button holes for touching those
They rarely kick my readiness only matched by my pettiness
Get the change where the couch at
Pick pocket fleas please get the cheese off they mousetraps
Remember they holdin just like us
Burners under the furniture 44s in floorboards
Murderers burglars they game just as hood
And they aim just as good a little better
Little Berettas with suppressors
And all the etceteras for whatever
We can pole climb cut phone lines the whole nine
But we gotta stay together thats the key to this
Even if its no longer secretive
They gonna start panicking when they see that you backstage without the laminate
Dont ease up niggas tend to freeze up become mannequins
What about you
Dont worry bout me
Im averaging fifty shots a game when its crackling
Turn the lights off on they ambulance
Just give me room to operate
They be in operating rooms with wounds to contemplate
Dont speak no room to commentate
Make sure ya sneakers tied no shoes to confiscate
Get aways take cables out they Sables
Slash the tires on they Chryslers no survivors
Niggas cant make it with MacGyver
Either you get them or they get you
No amount of karate class can keep you outta body bags
So save ya boxing and Ninjitsu
Dont be cheap bullets is ten cents apiece
Give em each a saw buck the instant they reach
Moving on make sure you know whos who
Whos you whos not and who to shoot upon
Friendly fire and hitting innocent standbyersll
Get your enemy wired and its bad enough
So dont go gassing em up
Leave that for the shells the 12s from the pumps
If done correct the condos on me
Gotta go rocknroll lock and load on three

Verse 1
Flow cant be seen

Im heavy nigga tow cant be seen
Like Im repossessing a Chevy nigga
Dont hang with those niggas those cant be safe
Even in they panic rooms
I will soon be forest to the floor of this
Stethoscope to the door of it
Listenin for the break
And I dont care how long gettin the combination takes
I be concentrating on the crack get it straight
I was so high up the food chain that which I mentioned before
I aint know how to make
I master shake like Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Already number one in the hood G
Its like my third deal off Could Be
Get it focused one of the coldest you gonna run across
Like it was stolen from a under boss
Spent for stack and sold to another boy
He might never get it back
So whoever got it getting whacked if they ever get caught
Now thats what I call reaction to a chain snatching
Game got bout as much compassion as The Passion
So it gotta make a comeback just like a champion

Hook

Verse 2
I run it back to that last piece of action
My necklace was tooken by detective
I dont stress it I just gather up my essence
As real as the view through my Cartier correctives yeah
But now back to the punchin
Back to flo like crunching
Got a 6 pack on the low now Im sunk in
Look like Im driving from the back seat
With a bird shotgun like Im hunting
You see what happened
I made a call and she got fly
I was pumping hit her up
Then I sent my dog to go and pick her up
Camouflaged fitted cut to the left velours how I did it up
And to the whole Westside I tip it up
And over to the single baby mama with no job that gotta WIC it up
To all my niggas in the CCDOC waiting on they quick collect to come
So they can live it up
And to my niggas that liquor they livers up and distribute cut in the belly
Sit it up

Hook

Verse 3
In the abdomen is Madison from which I came
But this my gang
FNF crew first and fifteen
Bear arms like Labatt Blue
Oh yes its bullets in the toasters as many as the clips that the gun hold
And they itchin to come up out the magazine like the posters that unfold
So my heat like Tigerbeat
I got the shotgun and the drivers seat
So if Lupes a coupe my man is a sedan
If theres more than 2 of us then you up against a van
If Im leavin then you leavin
If your niggas wanna come yall can ride with me
Its just gonna be a lot of squeezin
Ya understand
That I dont need Caroline calculator to divide defeat
Just lean a little closer
The flows are his as roses is
So override your pride and decide retreat
Its suicide to meet
Like a broke stock broker and a sidewalk
Yall niggas aint fly as me
Thats why I defy physics and yall niggas collidin peace
Im up here with the Leers
Yall down down there with the airs
Emperors in the mirror youre playing with a pair
Nigga I is we
Twice the MC like mcsquared
Trust I make it relate
I got the pokerface and Im hiding a flush
Still riding the beat
With a air that still smells like roses from Andre 3000
My housing surroundings is what made me me
And thats two times the G
You see how I doubled that the third time nigga please

Come back to people like me I say

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Its mean soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
Its really thirtysix
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple I was over the scripts
See I could walk the walk couldnt really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now Im over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbals able
Thats the Usual
When I was po I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
Its Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please dont Interscope
Its gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With LUPEmperor
Is the foundations Ibeams and the antennas
Its so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme

This is gangsta man

Gangsta lean
Hats on tilt like these Snickers aint drop out the vending machine

Its horse in the Porsche and bricks in the box
Like mo money them every time I cop a car
You see Im a roller right
So it might be a Rover right
But every time I drop an r
Get off the streets
Its over ight
Bet I be in the head like overnight
Like rollers right
She the chauffeur right
So I keep her sober
She dont get Fed Ex like overnight
I am Dolemite
All that gas cant help you but solar might
Just call on sun
Drop a s
Pick up an o
Uno put it all on one
Brace yourself like overbite
For that quiet nigga that relocated down south
Coming back to floss
Nigga get your molars right
Fix your grill
No plaque but a whole lot of cheese
This the drill
Mr Chill gave me the green light like Yoda knife
So Imma force my will
Like the Force I wield
Of course you will
Take my time
But weight behind only pertains
To that Porsche grill
Its snakes in the hood
Gotta watch for that Cobra bite
Let me see
Theres snakes in the hood
A bird a horse behind the grill
Something gator on the seat
And a fox behind the wheel
No its not Noahs Ark Ahk

So the corners of the dean was racin niggas yellin Gimmie
That reminds me little Kenny got shot three months ago damn
Fresh out the hospital shot three weeks ago damn
Come to find out only difference from the first

Dont think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace but the drama intrigues us
All so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin to teach we show our teeth
Same God different beliefs
Hijabs Sunday clothes yarmulke kufi same mission beneath
We all tryin to get to where the sufferin ends
In front of the Most High bein judged for our sins
Cant front for the Most High so the struggle
Continues
You every bee bird and tree he her and me

With the same goats on the same sea
Tryin to stay afloat and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of Gods quotes

During Hajj we walk through Ramadaan we starve
Though you not eatin theres a feedin of the mind
A defeatin of the demons a seein of the signs
A leanin on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer God deemed it unclean
Theres no eatin of the swine
Nor drinkin of the wine
We all bend to his whims so I send out a message to my kind
Im cordial to Mr Norful Mrs Adams youre the theme song when Im battling

And to my Akhs tryin to stay on their deen
It gets mean especially when you stay on the scene
And at the same try to stay out of trouble

And hustle
You gotta stay on your salats your zakats your Quran
To my homies and miskeen

Bless us to be among the winners

But until then please strengthen the mission within our hearts
All praise is due to God

Old schooling instruction was mean
As I lean back like limbo
In 6 4s like Nintendos clean

Yall far from the hood like limousine trunks
Man Im up front with the pumps
And I squeeze in the cars like a mini full of clowns
Or a coupe full of Klumps
Many put it down but
Lu from the jump been producing that crunk
Fusion the music amusing the youth where Im from
Im from where you shouldnt come
OG ball see how law override like OG call
Comp cant hold it down they aint fatter then me
This is no seesaw easy
They cant see me like Im 4 feet tall
Standing behind a 43 wall
Believe me Im on the low
I do a little balling like BB
I get big like toadstools
Then I might jump into a coupe and its back to being small
I get little

Flees the scene like perpetrators

Cuz they cant take homie

Which is the west side
F I wicked as the witches from the
West side in the wizard
You see I live it scribble it
Deliver it then I distribute it
To my niggas But yet I
For the life of me
Cant understand the rivalry
Said about my number one fan my man
He used to ride with me
But now he spitefully uses fighting words to frighten me
Slightly perturbed I war at his words rightfully
I should be lightning like in his ass
But I pass and lightly brush off the ash
From the square of that square
You see I really dont care
But its a whole lot of insulted niggas over here
Bear in mind some of them mind all of them wont
Some of them rhyme all of them dont
Most of them grind all of them inclined
To see you signed and combined
To be on your ass so serious

And then I write it pimping
Then I record it dirty
Then its a song
But then they hate on me
Cuz they cant take homie

Pull of the leaves like she loves menot

Move slow like TaiChi
Down the block come kick it with me like Kung Fu
Where I hung like noose they call me young bruce
I cop Jordans pull chickens with these
Please was not odd to work at papa
Though I came with a biscuit
Just tryin a make a mill
I brang in the bidness
Flow like chuch pulpitted with ease
Pivot and pull from the lines like threes
Gain a better understanding
Im just tryin a make it real
Like a fisherman pon da river fam
Im pon my bank deposit my thoughts
Till my mind draws a blank
And I withdraw from checking
Ill leave that with yall for a second
Give you a minute to let it sink
Didnt I advise baptize
For them dead presidents Ill tie a bomb to your brakes
And burn money faster than you learn you aint even conserve money
Gave you a second now I return hungry
Period young blood I return monthly

Fuck police I slip through they fingers like rosaries
Off the hook with the 38 rotaries
Get it locally move antisocially
Twice the rapper get it from both of me jokingly
So constant and nonchalant from BICs to Mont Blancs
Lose conscience Lus not the one to confront
Worth my weight you impersonate niggas like
Miller Light spit it right in your life terminate
Im the worst case scenario
Bump heads for coins like Mario
Pop more rounds than MerryGorounds from birth date to burial
In South Beach beeches going south with they mouth piece without speech
Oh now hes official from the start
They miss you holding vigils in the dark
Go head try and stop it couldnt block sun with Hawaiian Tropic
Whats in your pockets my profits
Foxes pick me up like chop sticks this hotness
They wanna put me in boxes like chocolatesthats nonsense
Nothin sweet about this but the hotel room Presidential like the wrist
I know Im sorry I never meant to end shit
Never rental get mine freeway like Van Wyck
Peace to Francis and all my manziz
Take trips to Franceiz where all my manz is
With fifths in handziz rewind and chant this niggas

I got a bezel from embezzlin Good Heavens And they said I lost it in 97
About to start using Mexicans not cause they better than just cause I get Si Senor not I need more
With chicks from Singapore from bunk beds 
To tour room Colonials and still testimonial
And so I keep it secret in the kitchen in the cabinet in a jar where the grease is
LUP speaks it til its pieces peanut butta like
Always being a quiet cat not the meanest motherfucker type
For a hundred grand plus Id be buffin brass Knucks
Best listen to your dawgs get Son of Samd up what
Ahead of my time failed history passed chemistry quiet nines in Quinine
My energy always be weaponry to unload while theres people to holdup reputations to uphold
Im Gung Ho with them white lines not the kind that divides traffic
But the kind that reminds addicts automatics to yo attic
Tecked out Porsche in the decked out Boxter WASup

Weapons concealed here
Little sisters on the pill here
Cant pay bills here but we like to chill here
Gotta reap what you sow grow what you til here
Your momma weep where you sowed cause you was killed there
Police put cameras on poles too many deals there
Gotta go to the county cause you was filmed there
How does it feel knowing innocence was killed here
Last night down the park beating harpo still there
For loveliest chain I make up pills here
Lets pray for our brains bustdowns kneel here

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
There was once a child in here
Cause all the tribulations and the trials in here
And all the limitations of his housing there
Became a teenage trafficker a thousandaire
Captivated with what the drug dealer told
Infatuated by what the drug dealer drove
A life validated by what a drug dealer holds
On the stand because what another drug dealer told
A drug dealers woe time waits for no man
No woman waits for a man with time on his hands they dont
Didnt you know lord they fearing ye now
They hearing ye now
Specially when the conspiracy comes down
We come down get humble
Its no longer fun now
But who gonna hustle to feed his son now
From the cradle to the cage
We bring our sons to be be gunned down
Our daughters to have more  its war

Wanted nothing but to love somebody
Didnt wanna die young
But it helps me try to feed my family
Too scared to have kids
And do what daddy did because Im so scared of failing
Sometimes it gets hard
Coming from where Im from

Theres nothing like the feeling when you do it from here

To try and turn the tide help withstand the stint
The time when it was hectic strictly on the strength
Thats why we got moves to make

Verse
Dear Fall You might not know what my album is called
Its Lupe Fiascos Food  Liquor
God willing September is when I plan to fall
I mean drop like the temperature
Then rock on right through the winter
Put something on they mind give em lines to remember
Aw a lifetime remembered which is mine
Then recorded put it in Georges then rewind then look into
My misadventures adventures into the Underworld
Hanging with them Cover Girls this aint my enter nawww
On Arista I coulda been a contender
But BMG had a different agenda
What up LA Reid I still see ya
You still my homeboy wont even charge ya for a feature
I went from MC to being MS
Thats microphone controller to motivational Speaker
Niggas astaghfirullah Im not a prophet
But Fahrenheit 115 is being quoted by preachers
Far from being a leader
But Im still being invited by teachers
With no Hennessy and no reefer
Give him a hand I came from handmedown sneakers
And I dont wanna boast or brag
But for what most niggas hope a nigga done had
Chop game with my folk and split it in half
You aint gotta bring it back tomorrow a nigga can have
Rich or broke a nigga aint mad
Selfesteem will make a Regal ride like a Silver Seraph
Just wipe the french fries off the seat
Lean back and I tilt my hat uh
And nod my head to the baseline
Freebase to the 8 times at Baseline watching Jay put it together
I wonder if he knew
While he was mumbling that this would push Lupe forever
Together with the FNF crew
Atlantic on post proudly present to you uh
Some newsomething fresh something different
A lil to the left a lil upliftin
A lil good game a lil hustlin in it
Some SB Nikes some nice crushed linen
Dont forget the skateboard of course the nice women
Can I get a mic check And a lil light dimming
And a fresh bottle of Voss maybe with some light lemon
And you gotta blame my momma for the lil lightskinning
And this aint written I swear Autumn
I was just recording em as I thought em
A YG FNF UP

Verse 1
I gave you honesty on my first joint
And yall all came out
I showed you what change bout
Unroll your blunts pour your champagne out
Dullers of the pain so you can plainly see
The black man pain I campaign bout
God willing fore I wane I take a champion route
Before I throw a bout Ill walk out the game
While my fans in the stands is chanting my name out Lupe
And its going to be PPV wont be back for free
Gone need scratch to see me rematch with me
My greatest enemy is my inner me
So I take this urge and give you Revenge of the Nerd Fahrenheit 115
Yeah and you know I fight the feeling
Box so I can shop sometime it doesnt register
So I return to the ring like Return of the King
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it
Im a klepto stealing
And it gets the best
Just when I guess that I left those leanings
I be back on post in a trench coat scheming

Hook
Much is more what we got in store
Just believe me than they can ever see
Much more than they can see
Is how itll always be believe me

Verse 2
So I get back into my stance revert to my dance
With a shirt full of pants
And my accomplice got a purse full of pants
A pocket full of purses with no intent to purchase in the plans
And we rehearsed it till its perfect just to dodge the searchers of the man
Just to surface outside then return of all the merch to stay
In the service of the perfect understand
And I boost myself
So from the coal car to the caboose Im felt
From the rear to the engineer
From the L to the Underground Railroad
From the redline to the TGV
A champion fighter for whom the bell tolls LUP
Little engine from the hood the hustler in me
Known to hit the track like John Henry
Just give me my glasses
My eight ounce Everlastes
And a Michael Buffer entry
Shoplifter tag switcher
Thats me nigga Im back with ya

Intro
Hes meaaaan and vicious

Verse 1
Uh I cant believe hes that rude
To those stories those rhymes that Jew
Then he put em on the floor like cat food
And put em on the track like glue
Then put em on your head like hat hey back to you Lu
Black power Im just runnin with a barrel full of black powder
With a hole in it holdin it wheezin deep breathin
Runnin from the fire on the trail I keep leavin
I cant shake it I swear its heat seekin I keep seekin
Somewhere to hide from it duck and dive from it
But it keep keepin up just when I think that Ive done it
It keep sneakin up oh leakin barrel of black powder
How that flame keep reachin us
Just one of the longwinded extended metaphors of Lus
This time I use an example of a fuse to demonstrate
How I cant lose I would put it down
But I cant due to the glue that I use to fuse
Everything together well I spilt some on my hands
And goddamn I might have to carry this forever
Well Im crazy to the game till they bury me insane

Refrain
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side
Of Chicago liked his hat to the left side
Wasnt in a gang but he was prone to bang
Doin his thang doin his thang
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side
Of Chicago liked his hat to the left side
Wasnt in a gang but he was known to bang like
Doin his thang doin his thang

Verse 2
Truthfully I have trouble with second verses
Cause the first one be so intimidatin it be bullyin
Pickin on it instigatin pointin out all the second ones limitations
Like You aint nothin but a imitation like bits o bacon
Then he gets the chorus and the beat to get together
Then they all gang up on him and get to hatin
But then around the eighth bar he tires of their conspirin
Commiseratin then he finds his inspiration
To spar he takes a few seconds of judo lessons
Gets back on beat then punches the guitar
They stand in awe like When did you write that
They aint even right black first verse already happened
So he dont have a chance to fight back I like that
Abagnale Junior check me you gon respect me
Aight Trakk listen to him feelin himself
Swagger up and a few adlibs to back it up woo
Lets back it up I think youve had enough
Give me my mic back you aint even write that
Oh its like that Trakk stop pumpin
Til this nigga stop frontin yeah yeah now right back

Refrain

Verse 3
Oh my God my perils and my odds
I aint really here what you hear is a mirage
This aint the delivery baby this is just Lamaze
The ice cream and pickles the tickle and a massage
The King Arthur rhythm of the night El DeBarge
The camouflage water in the distance flogging a camel
To get there with the quickness mean and vicious
Grinch Who Stole Christmas and hid it in the garage
That was a collage a barrage I brought all things
That seem keen to help this thing start
Jump jump my battery charge
Im bout my green like string beans and beings from Mars
Its a mean thing to be seen with ours
Got that FF on me Im a young lil thriller
I will resurrect homie come back for my killa
In some disheveled apparel with that same leakin barrel its on

Refrain

Crucial Conflict was smokin but a nigga like me I dont be chokin
So I proceed at a low speed low key like a OG in a 03 Locin
Rollin like a OZ in a bleafboth pins like a bowlin ball

Dont step on the block that I run
Block that I brung the first beamer that theyd ever seen on these
Wit with the rocks I sling like David
Fee Fi Fo Fum
By nature Im a hustla
Move pack like I move and Im packing
Yall niggas move back on the come up like elevator action
Welcome to the actionpacked world of trapping
Where we tip into ChiTown if you cook a key you will see
If you chop the nickels that you can get a drop and a box of pistols
Have to get it cooked so you can not get little
Fast echo
Money echo
cause all my habits important
I kept the illest hoopers in high school and Jordans
Kept the illest rappers in the hood recording

Know how much that vagina costs
If a playa suspect the game gon reject him
Welcome to the worlds oldest profession

Verse 1
Uh I bring you murder in the first
And even as we speak we getting further in this verse
With no further ado I do what I respect
Doom got me stripes like Hamburgler for my work
As Lupe the killa killa killa killa
Mercy hes a mess so immersed in his murk
Hes 23 submerged below the surface where they surf
This is where I lay it down like a bird giving birth
So call me Lu the Giants Goose or just Faberge paint
Til Im called back to the shore by the watchers of the bay
I wait til I come back like a tsunami
Never microwave like the watchers of the weight
Im wrapped in aluminum foil I do my dirt like Kwame
Until that same soil being pushed into my grave
But Im so ahead of my time the next day
Might strike oil while I delay homie Im so crude
Texas T haters is so screwed
But I cant fill it like a flathead in a Philips
Dont get it twisted nigga Im no tool
More cool than a pool in a blizzard
With ice cubes in it during Christmas
Meanin theres no school Im the misfit
Like Im throwin a fit
Or I just cant fit it tidbit too big
Its gotta hem it til its fresh to death
Dressed to kill it like uh

Verse 2
Uh 187 on my second I reckon
This is an assault with a deadly session
A soft peace and blessings to the sentence that be reppin
All across in every direction locality and section
That know Lupe the killa killa killa killa
Give it how I live it most niggas wont believe
Or achieve how I did it most niggas wont receive
Til I leave and I bereave the secrets of my sickness
How I flooded the streets like Venice
Ive suffered demanded withstanded pimp handed and hustlin
Im Colonel Mustard with the speech
They aint catchin me no suspicions of stickin
No convictions on my rap sheet
Im so committing lay my murder gamethats sweet
Speakeasy like Prohibition no admission
If you aint knocking like me to the underground bar burying a toast
Dodging the raid like roach nigga please

Verse 3
Uh I make it give up the ghost
On the trifecta the third I differ
Nigga you aint heard my lecture like Lector
Letchya in on a secret but you cant leak it
Lupes the killa killa killa killa
Since my entrance my niggas had packs
They moved em to a trap like Winston
Far from bustas baby nah
All my homies henchmen
I was the rhymer my talk went through the walls like Slimer
Or like eating vagina
Or a stray bullet whichever ways I put it
Crooks was hooked like crooks through neighborhoods I pushed it
Little Caesar niggas pizzas was like book it
Delivery mean like Leroy Green
They couldnt take it to the places I took it
Beware you dont look it
You aint dressed for this affair
Im hooded in the bushes like uh

Intro Lupe Fiasco
You know what Im sayin
You know some niggas really out there bad
You know what Im sayin
Some niggas is forced in positions where they gotta do things where they dont wanna do it
You know what Im sayin
So some niggas forced to dope sell dope
Some niggas forced to pimp
You know what Im sayin
But you got some niggas out there that
Just lazy you know what Im sayin
Niggas aint forced to do nothin
Niggas got other options they just choose not to do em you know

Verse 1
Sittin in the back of the police car position
Your mission is forgetting and denying the existence
Thinking of different ways to keep from submitting
And continuing to not to mention
like that
Grand Marquis Police Interceptor edition
With the wall so you can barely fit in
Knees is touching the front seat shifting
Cause your handcuffs is cutting your wrist and
Your wishing that he would drive faster pleeease
But he slows through the hood as he drives past the free
Its cool but you tripping
The quicker you get there
The quicker you sit there
Cuffed to a bench and
They playing good cop bad cop
One of the them pretending
So you rewind yourself
To your uneasy recline in the back of the police car
Handcuffed and the seat belt
Nah you aint gotta quicken the pace
That just give me more time to sit and erase
Alibi and alias switch and replace
Think about then forget about an escape
Thank God that Im up in the states
Cos if I was in Russia who knows how theyd do a hustler
Wait I aint a hustler Im straight
Im damn near a buster no laws I break
Money I never seen guns I didnt hold
Drugs I never sold calls I didnt make
Nigga this is a waste of your time and mine
Is that uncomfortableIm fine
A case This aint even a fine
You aint find nothing homie not even a dime
Not even a dime thatll drop dime on me
I know you was dying so you put a dime on me
I know thats a crime you supposed to fight crime for me
Protect and to serve
Prosecute correct and return to the homies
And thats gonna send them direct to the curb
So you can put em back on me

Hook

Verse 2
Hes sitting in the front of the police car position
His mission is bending pinning charges on niggas
Even if they didnt
Hes sitting in court lying
Testifying against defendants
Like that
And he love to choke niggas
He dont trip with the rich
He just like the broke niggas
Probably did more dirt in the street than most niggas
Even the old people dont like him
Cos of the way he approach niggas
Nigga you aint no better than me
Just a hustler with a badge
Confiscate the dope money
Put it with your retirement boat money
You aint building no playgrounds
In the poor for some cash
That aint a pension
Thats a shoe box stash
With a Glock to protect it
We both undercover check it
Thinking that the good we do
Gon out weigh the sinning that we do to collect it
Saying its for the community
They dont value us
Only around because the property value up
And they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up
Knock them Section 8s down
Put them 200000s up
Feel he dont get paid enough
To kick in doors to raid and cuff
So he use what niggas get on the street
To supplement the wages cut
So he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustling
To keep his paper up
Like that
Maybe he should be in the handcuffs

Soon as they ride Ill get back on my nigga shit
Cant reverse
The boygame Advanced complete the genesis
Ive broke bread with societies menaces
Ive dedicated sentences to the dead and said hold your heads to my niggas doin sentences
I send condolences to the victims but threats to the witnesses
On my path I was facing a paragraph myself
So they sentiments is felt
When you hate your own and discriminate of self
In a cell gotta make your home coz you might never make it home
Suicide on your side might commit it with your belt
Keep your pants on homie
Streets are damn so lonely like only
A bunch of niggas wont help nah
Thats the enemy of stealth
Plus if they get caught how you gonna keep your heart fatigue
The hustlers diet is the enemy of health give you heart disease
Arteries hard but its hard to leave the bread alone
Arent we hard headed headed for harm but dont fret it homes
From the twist tied to the butt
We be rippin it up
From the horror to the cure dont force the issue

Verse 1
When your spirit is strained
And you limited to change
The lyrics in your limericksll change
A different hook the way the sentences arranged
More demented in your deliverance more sinister in your slang
Sounds more belligerent when its sang
The truth is limitless in its range
If you drop a T and look at it in reverse it can hurt
Look at the grimaces of the pain
And its worse when it works and your membership is gained
But you forgetting the proof diminishes in the flames
Like poof the media pours images in your brain
Of the score of the war where militants is slain
The faces of the guilty where innocence is proclaimed
And they filthy the deaf ears are the winners
The listeners are the lames
Of the ballad of the man that the son of a minister has became
So

Hook
Wherefore does my glory go
Wherefore does my glory go Glory glory
Wherefore does my glory goWherefore does my glory go
Wherefore does my glory go Glory glory

Verse 2
But you gotta understand our differences is the same
What starts in clouded minds finishes in the reign
Of the fools that are used as instruments in the game
Where oppression is the queen and ignorance is the king
Where revolution is dead no candles in is memory
No remembrance of its fame just a mystery
No mentioning the history of the chain the enemy
No hennessy sentiments in its name
Just an unmarked grave that menaces have defamed
With the propaganda and images of the gangs
A lost art no apprentices in it trained
And they brainwashed no interest in its stain
And the minds weary all the adrenaline in it drained
While the wrecking ball is disassembling things
Her highness is the cause his eminence is the blame
The pride is still there the privileges still remain but

Hook

Verse 3
And youve gotta respect the position in which you playing
Never let your heart reflect the conditions in which its staying
Even if its dark and the temperature is the same
As winters in the Ukraine your appendages is in chains
Have forgiveness from the start keep maliciousness restrained
Be smart never indiscriminate in your aim
Cos theres innocent witnesses oblivious to the things
That come the ones the hypnotists keep entertained
And you cant arc have some resilience in your frame
Stay resistant and stay committed to what you sing cos
They can flip it the minute that you refrain
Read the book and the lines and literature in between
And gotta be educated when going against the grain
Pay attention they illegitimate in their claims
They assisted in the killing and pillaging
In addition to the addiction
Shit is much bigger than just them planes but

Unidentified man So Lu whos next man Whos up and coming in the game

Lupe Next kid um well of course my man um Gemini from the South Side of Chicago uh good kid good MC
Know what Im saying got some fire For real though but youll see

Gemini

Gemini
First and fifteenth niggas
Yeah
Uh huh
Feel me on this one
Yeah
Yeah
I done grew to be a monster
8 nigga face of a killer
Addicted to the taste of liquor so I pray for my liver
I gotta get up out my mammas basement
She need some more space and I feel her fuck could I do but take the sweet with the bitter
On top of that just had a baby delivered
Child support chasing a nigga
But I aint got no paper to give em
Water leaking from the cracks of the ceiling
Couple roaches here and there but they aint half as bad as in the beginning
Its like they always showed their ass whenever company visit
And then that black flag splashed em and they finally diminished
Losing ambition
Graduated school by inches
Eating Ramen noodle soup cuz aint no food in the kitchen
Taking baths with the same shit we use with the dishes
This is unconstitutional to you but I live it
Could move and distribute but Im cool cuz I aint trying to do prison
You couldnt walk inside my shoes unless you truthfully lived it
This is far from just some more Cago nigga
With cars and bitches running through Chicago twisting
This is top flow Picasso picture
12 car garage door living
Just better pray them Glock floors dont
Whys my best friend hoping I fail
Molded him well
Love him but fuck him
He can get the bulk of the shells
I write my life in a notepad and hope that it sells
Cuz broke or in jail aint cutting it like coke on the scale
Get toast by the belt
Too blind to fucking post it in braille
Loading my shells Im focused on a soul who I kill
No coat shall I tail
Coasting on this boat that I sail
I float with the whales
A free Willy cannot go to jail
Cause I swore that Id be 6 feet in a pine box cold
Before I let the streets of South Chicago swallow my soul
I seen too many friends before me choose that horrible road
Couldnt harbor the load froze and they swallowed em whole
Until you niggas is probably plotting to rob me and scram
Just call it quits
You be dead before you count the first grand
You may get far as Queen Latifah and the rest of her friends
You wont pull a Jada Pinkett you can trust that fam
So Im screaming help me dearly with tears in my pants
Ill be found in the cemetery buried next to my grams
I get dirty like 2 Mexican hands dropping the trans
Chopping up grams cause me starving is not in the plans
Motherfucker

Switch With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
That mixed with a little bit of pimp and a little bit of mack
And a little bit of limp and a whole lotta gangsta lean

Conflict Diamonds

Intro
Diamonds are forever yeah
They wont leave in the night
Ive no fear that they might desert me
Uh FF yeah
You know what Im saying
I figure I feel like I should just
You know show people other side that werent aware
You know what Im saying
They are presently unaware
They dont know about it
You know what Im saying
You know just show em theres an other side to this thing right here
We call it bling

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Yeah
Allow me to break down the game
Behind the bracelets earrings chains watches and rings
The bling
The crystal encrusted princess flooded
Canary studded blue coloured and blood stained
Yeah the older brother of the drug game
The giver of fame the take awayer of lame
The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child minus pain
Long ago kings used to wear em in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it used to scare em
If you wasnt rich couldnt wear em
Witches used to marry em
Theyll shoot you before they share em
The gift and the curse the venom and the serum
Most hated ladys best friend get merced for a clear one

Bridge
Diamonds are forever yeah
You know what Im saying
Diamonds are forever
Now I aint comin down on nobody
You know what Im saying
I aint trying to judge nobody and nothin like that Forever
You know what Im saying
I floss too I might go get me a pinky ring tomorrow
You know what Im saying
But I just want you to see man
You know what Im saying
Just see man

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Uh Cecil Rhodes sowed war and genocide
Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasnt thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that dont believe in following none of Genevas rules
I was brushing off the haters trying to be cool
Didnt have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocent torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uh I aint pushing an agenda homie
Im just pushing the facts fuck Bush
Cause theres people doing worse on this earth and theyre black
I took it there yeah now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself do they finance yours
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didnt know they lost half the value when I took em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldnt prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didnt appraise it nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl thinking I was cupid
Homies was all hate hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood knew I had to remove it
I see the Russian Mafia the Jewish Mobsters
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers
Homie its a wrap for the nonsense rhyming
Props to Kanye I call this Conflict Diamonds

Outro
Diamonds are forever yeah
You know what Im saying
I felt like I should just let you all know that
You know what Im saying
Make you all aware so many people
Do things to glorify em
I felt like it was time for somebody to do somethin
That would horrify em
You know what Im saying
Bet you never thought that
That 20 karat ring or 20 karat chain or bracelet that you got on
Is fundin some little war somewhere
Got some little kid murderin a whole family somewhere
You know what Im saying
But hey Just think now you know
You know what Im saying
You gotta know to be a hypocrite baby haha

If yall dont know what that means homie
Then yall understand thats mean homie
That means homie these jeans on me are only pale
After sewing machines homie

Like a dictionary
Just listen clearly to the clean homie
And this aint fair Im barely on my lean homie
I put my all like into a washing machine homie
Double loader you just watchin me clean homie
Wait til I sod you in dirt
Oops I spilled some 1st  15th on me

Are all nerds as good as you
Yes

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Look look Gander gander
Its the young boy from the Lambda Lambdas
The Land of Lincoln the Grand Theft Auto Chicago
Warn all the mics that hes hardcore
And hes thinking rose bearers to the area
Spotlights dancers dancers
Pro Tools come in answer answer
His flow is like the Klu Klux versus the Panthers
HaHaaaaa

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Hit the track like a heart attack cancer cancer
Boogie Man on the mic and a band of Santas
And the Easter Bunny is the backup dancer
They fainting in the stands gotta fan the fansuh
Panties on the stage and the pampers of grandmas
Cause they love the way that I pamper the grammar
Moon Man strutting down the ramp of the lander
Was nuts with the cane Planters Planters
Adjust my frames tamper tamper
Im real they Seinfeld
They aint talking bout nothing George Castanza
Louder louder grander grander
Cuff a friend we tell it to em like Miranda
The games in danger panda panda
Send orders to the reporters tell em pan the cameras
You might get killed if you dont listen enough
Well I guess Im dead cause I aint listen to Puff
HaHaaaaa

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
Best believe our system it sucks
And a person like me dont believe in assistin in such
Nah I be rippin em up
But for every pond there is different ducks
I believe if you participate at a lower level you can get a lot more things done
Like working with the alderman but I aint alterin this song
To be a political statement
Lets take it back to the basement
To the encore of the sold out tour
The More mores and the standing ovations
They be standing with more patience than the county on a Friday
I did it my way thank them

Once upon a time
At the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as happy folk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excessive violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called monkey was enough
Then one day strange folk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage
Hidden behind dark glasses
And no one noticed them
They only saw shadows
You see
Without the truth of the eyes
The happy folk were blind

Lupe Fiasco
Once upon a time not long ago
An idea yeah thats what I had
To take Demon Days and a little Pro Tools
With my MCing ways and make them mash
Just having fun not chasing cash
Apologize now if it make you mad
Had to call G Ball tell him warm up the mic
Put the padding on the wall time to make some magic
Studio is nothing lavish
Matter of fact its just an attic
Background noise from the fan
That hitting the mic stand and the outside traffic
Still turns out fantastic
Turn my vocals up just a tad bit
Fresh from the 1st  15th
Quarantine touching you super cool now thats sick

Lupe Fiasco
So sit on back and enjoy the show
Then lean on forward and enjoy some more
And then sit back again
And keep on enjoying like you was enjoying before
Whether you enjoy the beats or enjoy the flow
As long as you enjoying it it bring joy to Joe
And Joe is me but woe is me
If you and yours aint enjoying the show
So dont worry about the time it take
If you aint got one better find a date
A beautiful inside or a dime that take
I proudly present to you A Rhyming Ape
My rhymes are straight
If you aint got one better find a date
A beautiful inside or a dime that take

Well I know when they come for me will I feel it
When he blew all his money to ball did he feel it

When he stopped and he dropped when he died did he feel it

Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told her lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in bag take the pennies out the drawer
Little Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish black boots and black hat
He going to blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
Little Joker got a gun he bought on the street
To go and kill the niggas that beat him up last week
Cause he dont let go of none of his past beefs
Bullets flying out the window shells landing on the seats
Little Sarah got a gun from her Uncle Sam
She got armorpiercing rounds and her gun dont jam
She got laserguided rockets she killing to go to college
She thought it was an insurgent it was some old man
Now you can get guns on the internet

Catch me like Spalding catch me like Rawlings
If he indeed the MC vitamin like GNC
Cant see me like BIG on CMT
Did a little bit of time on BMG
But this right here homie this all me
Can you be down nah nigga CMB
Thats cold that aint nice G
So what though little homie remind me of IceT
By the way we share the same birthday
The word play is work but pimping is easy
So catch me Im balling
Im sick too if you aint catch me like coughing
Back when I said you should catch me like Rawlings
Its cool cause most cats that I bump into cant catch me that often
Most times they just end up falling
Ball for a few then end up walking
Catch me in the ball with a Cinderella waltzing
And I do it until its no longer exclusive
Might go once might go twice
But never three times like an auction to it
See I walk into it I do my thang
And tell a homie that its cool to let yall into it

Hijabs hoodies afros locks
Teddy bear liquor bottle shrines rocks
Tanks prayer rugs church pews Mexican corn stands
Blood sweat and tears police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners

Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause hes tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin nobodys hirin
In Illinois 67 is the new age when you retirin
Class lines have blurred those who used to have have not
Pensions bein snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a tshirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later its back to normal
But they say times are changin
The revolution is becoming second nature causes are combining
People carrying torches hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Now I cant pledge allegiance to your flag
Cause I cant find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast these streets are demons abs
Im telling you that setup in them situps is so sad
The system is a slab corruption is the swinger
Sitting high riding dirty drag racing into danger
And its so clean pine trees smelling good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I cant shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor
I shed tears I dont know what really matters anymore
Cause I dont know what really matters anymore

Man it aint mean
The strangest thing youve ever seen
Oh would you look at how they swing
Would you look at how they swing
They aint dead though
No I didnt die yall I cut myself down
And I admire my fall into grace

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Now as I wander through the city going mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience full of swag
Man they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doing bad
Then the separation from the truth is getting vast fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Doubleedged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Doubleheaded voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money delighted by the dummying
Down of the importance of crowns well never have
Thats why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad
Hating on your happiness you hit em off with laughs
Smile til they surrender then you kill em off with glad
Hello evil Im back

Hook Casey Benjamin
Man it aint mean

Verse 1
Hey shawty aint no future in no gangbang
And aint no manhood in no bangbang
Aint no honor cleanin interstates inside a chaingang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry nigga said a Camry
Watch that ho depreciate and then youll understand me
Its called being fiscally responsible
Dont let these lying images up in hiphop here conquer you
The TVs not your father fool that videos not your mama
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster

May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen

Empathy for the old more justice for the downpressed
Treat no liar ital iyah

Verse 2
I know youre sayin Lupe rappin bout the same shit
Well thats cause aint shit changed bitch
And please dont excuse my language
Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent

I cant listen if you aint sayin shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous

Mercy of the Lord on this doubleedged sword
Instead of askin where the hoes is
Maybe maybe may we have some roses

Hook
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen

Some peace humanity for the whole widewidewide world

But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home
Blew that bitch up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy Palestinian throwing stones

Cause this the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness

Verse 1
First off say Peace to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance Trail of Tears five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everythings hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes racism and a land grab
Katrina FEMA trailers human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Baath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause thats just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs

Hook
Live from the other side what you see

Cause freedom aint free especially round my way

Verse 2
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
Americas a big motherfuckin garbageman
If you aint know youre part and parcel of the problem
You say no you aint and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didnt and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessaryness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say its highly ineffective
Depart from Martin connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
Its all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

Verse 3
An allwhite Los Angeles the dream of Mr Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of Gods gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where Dboy coke bound
Its parts of Manila like the video for Thriller
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then whats the flavor of the Sunday preachers pedophilia
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr Burns or Mr Smithers
The tyrant or the slave but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of Americas dream
Freud fighting Neo Freddy Krueger refereeing now

Intro Lupe Fiasco
Yeah I say bitch bad
Woman good lady better
Hey hey hey hey

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
Now I aint trying to make it too complex
But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this what she says
Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch
Somethin thats far above average
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin here
First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
And because shes relatin to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor

Hook Lupe Fiasco
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches
Now lets say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
Reality check Im not trippin
They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using bitch as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
Sho enough in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house hot mess like that
Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him bitch dont play a part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre

Verse 1
With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks thats been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his color will be cured

Verse 2
With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers she wont even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover no resistance no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldnt go to school but she thought that that should change

With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think its normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think hes safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesnt mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it aint no you and me
But when youre trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lovers phone sends you back into the zone
Go With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

PreHook Guy Sebastian
I wish I never looked I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much

The verbiage gets merciless this wordsmithness just rolls
Ive tuned into my pertinence my purposes my goals
The feeling when you realize youve been working for your foes
And the curtains have just opened and they worthlessness exposed

There was nothing in the oven and just work up on the stove
And you blossomed from the bottom yeah you worked with it and rose

And screwed up where they pour
See I flew so way up high
And I SCUBAd way down low
Put the top down on my fears
Put the roof up on my woes
I dropped that food and liquor to put you up on my stove
They shoplifted and stole

And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
From the surface to the core
I took on the biggest wave
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode
That boat is now my bed desk dressers and my drawers
Now thats a house of pain

First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I wouldve said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That wouldve been the call but naw
You cant see in ours but we can see in yours
You cant see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall

So when that pond thaws and its no longer Gretzky
Thats when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up Lets see
Maybe see something we couldnt view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul we call that moving raw
Lions wont cross the line
Cougars wont move a paw
Chickens wont cross the road
Dogs wont roof at all
Always had flow just added a front door roof and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But thats only if you super dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just whos the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
Thats why I never really trust unless its Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now thats three mis like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horses head in your bed
Now thats what I call a good nights rest

You know You know just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go you know

Verse 3
And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now Im ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
Well dont forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But its no purple in the circle then there aint no rolling bs
Just spoken words thought provoking reeds
Hydro Im still strolling on the seeds
Aloe like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E Cheese
All without touching weed
But Im still hungry and Im having lunch for three
This is my form now what the function be

And art what I draw
And ooh what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas go to sleep
You know Its like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is it
It just be what it is you know

Verse 1
At my brothers Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Dont carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You work in progress from 40 projects God bless
An inspiration and a king
They wont know what I mean but this one bout to spring
Protect it with every feather on the wings
So even when it hurts youll never feel a thing

Chorus
Said its a cold cold war
Aint nobody wins like the government
In the USSR
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it but theres no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
Its a cold cold

Verse 2
Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
Thats the soul force of whats behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if Im over it
Or if Im numb because Im closureless
Or my closures that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it

Chorus
Said its a cold cold war
Aint nobody wins like the government
In the USSR
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it but theres no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
Its a cold cold

Verse 3
In the studio writing these words one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
Right in the back of this chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that its all lost or maybe that its all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now hes all gone
But he was never there cause
He was everywhere nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day rise up
Well both open our eyes up climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories

Chorus
Said its a cold cold war
Aint nobody wins like the government
In the USSR
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it but theres no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
Its a cold cold

Outro
Ride around you know what Im saying
All over the world right I mean everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere
Hed find his way back home yknowm saying
Another random things that consequence to me
But maybe to you not much
But with that said the reason behind me
Why I do what I does love
Just riding around bumping that uh
Either Jay or Nas or me
He used to tell em like yeah you alright
But you aint fucking with my man
It was always like that so
Drop a little for you let it bump
This that Esco music its that Esco music
Bumping with my Esco music that raw
See you on the other side AsSalamu Alaykum

This world my heart my soul
Things that I dont know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things Ive done
My young
My unforgivable youth

Verse 1
With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes and
What they think are islands are much more in their size and
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here And for five hundred years
Torture terror fear til they nearly disappear

Hook
This world my heart my soul
Things that I dont know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things Ive done
My young
My unforgivable youth

Verse 2
Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
How can land be owned by another man
Warns One can not steal what was given as a gift
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish
But the lesson went unheeded for the sake of whats not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists dont repair it when they leave it
The forestss were cleared the factories were built
And all mistakes will be repeated
By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
Foolishness and flaws greed and needs and disagreement
And then you rush to have the most from the day you left your boats
Youll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts

Hook Jason Evigan
This world my heart my soul
Things that I dont know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things Ive done
My young
My unforgivable youth

Verse 3
As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they were civil not barbaric in the least
A society at peace With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
Everythings so organized They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex Kinda hard to figure out
But this must be the temple
This White House

Hook Jason Evigan
This world my heart my soul

Verse 1
I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon might smite crows from the sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But Im warming up oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitaring
Would you look at all these spies
But they cant see me I took out their eyes
Replace with some hes so all they see is ehs
But I will never run not even if they cry
See I can never fall not even down their cheek
But I will always bawl lets see who the first to blink
And I dont need no passwords cause I dont need to cheat
But you can say your last words and you can rest in peace
Im the hook after your last verse Im also like the beat
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep

Chorus
So you can go to sleep yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep said you can go to sleep
Good night good night good night good night
Real niggas up again phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep now you can go to sleep
Good night good night good night good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off phony nigga nodding off

Verse 2
Insomniac since way back see this is what I been like
Baking eggs and pancakes eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard I dont need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm mental state is Zenlike
Always had a lot of heart never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime never been the 10 type
My girlfriend is very fine yes she is a ten right
Mink is draggin on the flo fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after the riots that I incite
Things get off the handle left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill stadium is fanfilled
Fill this bitch up with fans you still wont blow my candle out
My can do spirits in the house
And is possessing your possessions did you hear it by the couch
Boogieman under your bed not in your closet
Cause Im not a homo wont drill no door hole
I wont make a peep so you can go to sleep

Chorus
So you can go to sleep yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep said you can go to sleep
Good night good night good night good night
Real niggas up again phony niggas tucking in

Now you can got to sleep now you can go to sleep
Good night good night good night good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off phony nigga nodding off

Verse 3
I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And then my clothes dry but I am so high
I am sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come closer you can get warm but you get no pie
But you can sell it for em so heres you bow tie
Now get ready to fall cause humans dont fly
The boy in the balloon  see I didnt go hide
And Im coming back to float again
Close down all the opium but I had to OPEN
They said they need a hero in it so Im back to dope again
Pull up in that oldschool Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me this make me feel old again
Grandmas all around me I can feel her soul within
Hope my daddy over him woke the roosters woke the hens
Everythings cashmere count the sheep that you

If talk is cheap then my silence is diamonds Preach

From 45th and State to the last standing Henry Horner
JJs Harolds Chicken good finger lickin
While they sin gin sin sin at Rothschilds and Kenwood Liquors
The winos crooked stagger meets the high stride of the youth
Searchin for the truth
They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings
They get high off that trunk bass and 2020 rims
They rock braids Air Force Ones and Timbs
They drink Hennessy Hypnotiq and 40s
They call they women hoes bust downs and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed bubblin over in brown sugar
They keep empty Westside lots crowded hypes powdered
The well is running dry
The days of Malcolm and Martin have ended
Our hope has descended and off to the side
Waiting for the reinstallment of the revolution
Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution
But God has another solution that has evolved from the hood

Yeah my man said he wanted something real
Real real real real
Something he could recognize something he could feel
Feel feel feel feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real real real real FNF
Something that could make her move
Something she could feel
Feel feel feel

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Lust
Sometimes can override trust
She said thats why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything he crushed
Ruined everything he loved
He just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if its them
But we hush if its us

Hook Lupe Fiasco
Thats why my momma said she wanted something real
Real real real real
Something she could be proud of something she could feel
Feel feel feel feel
She said they so used to not having nothin real
Real real real real
That they dont know how to act
They dont know how to feel
Feel feel feel

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Life
Aint meant to come around twice
Yeah thats why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it thats why God give you night
I mean I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give em sight
Make em see break em free
Aint a G show you right

Hook Lupe Fiasco  Sarah Green
The game is not to give em nothing real
Real real real real
Nothing that they could use nothing that they could feel
Feel feel feel feel
Give em a bunch of lies and teach em that its real
Real real real real
So thats all theyll know
Thats all that theyll feel
Feel feel feel

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
Struggle
Another sign that God love you
Cause on the low
Being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes
To try and keep em out of trouble
Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes
Or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they aint got no reason to cuff you
Thats my plan if I can
On the man up above you

Hook Lupe Fiasco  Sarah Green
Thats why I gotta give em something real
Real real real real
Something they could recognize something they could feel
Feel feel feel feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give em something real
Real real real real
Something thatll make em stop
Something they can feel
Feel feel feel

I believe we are completed dig
We all in agreement on the wallpaper
Happy with the color scheme welcome to the crib
A two family Habitat For Humanity
With a view of where the insanity live
My vida loca was built like Bob Vila via God
He architected I arted what I harbored Jimmy Carter
From Chicagos west side finish my construction now
We hold the coming like contracepts
Im conscious cept the cons I kept
With conversations held with the Satan on my shoulder
Which lead to steps that kept me looking over the shoulder
Like chauffeurs where my angels at
Painful yet Mary I aint Jerry Garcia ma
Here but Im grateful chuuch

Hook Gemini
We just might be OK after all
Sun gone shine on this day

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Its finna get heavy as heaven
I am Atlas at this manage to balance
Massive masses pull my back with out tilting my glasses
This was not pilfered from passages of OGs this is so me
Ask us many mention little homie little bony
But the rhymes is fat in fact
Just like a Rochester customer
God bless the mothers and younger brothers of hustlers
Cause she dont wan sob at his wake
But he want to follow in his steps
Bang his hat learn his shakes
Master his swagger in the bathroom mirror
Cop a Chevy steady mob in his place
Chyeah its just the problems we face
Look his moms in her face and promise hes straight

Hook Gemini
We just might be OK after all
Sun gone shine on this day

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
Then he leaves the house that love built that
HUD renovated that section 8 pays for
Well lets pray for em let the beat play for em
Put his struggles on display for em
Cause he gotta go and face the drama
With a different face from the one that he use
To face his momma if you look close youll see
It consist of a smile that hurts an ice grill and a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father another criterion
Thats no different from a young Liberian
Who let the delirium weary him living in the inner city
Out of his mind liria reconcilia
Im cool I dont foretell best
I aint nicest MC I aint Cornel West
I am Cornel Westside Chitown Guevara
Malcolm eXorcise the demons gangsta leaning
He traded in his kufi for a New Era
Chose a 44 over a mortarboard
I aint a credited institute graduate I aint from Nazareth
My conception wasnt immaculate I aint master no calculus
A good addition to the rap audience

And it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
Theyd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said Theres no skating here

Flagrantly fragrant and they cant escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You dont want a loan leave my cologne alone
Its a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and yall cant mush me
I warn yall cornballs I hush puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly
But now they hug me because its lovely
They love the aroma of a roamer of the world
Got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
Keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl

Hook
You want the flava ma hey I gotcha

Children of the hat tiltin keepin hope alive now
All with no high I do it so fly
Banksys attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city really hope that God bless it
Have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of yall to my dark recesses
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My Ivories and my Doves my Levers and my Zests
This takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the beast you know Im from it
I wrap it in a towel hit Gomer Pyle in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring and I coast
Fudge wit it and get a mouth full of soap

Hook
You want the flava ma hey I gotcha
You want the realness well I gotcha

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Uhh yeah
He just sits and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box but he cant remember how to stop it
Uhh so he continues to watch it
Hoping that itll give him somethin that he can box with
Or how the locksmith see the box as locked in the box
Aint got the combination to unlock it
Thats why he watches scared to look away
Cause at that moment it might show him
What to take off the locks with

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
He just sits and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not comin out the box he blocks it
See he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do he does it
Anything it tell him to get he shops and he cops it
He protects the box locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it scared to look away
Cause at that moment it might get stolen
And thats the last of the boxes

Swallowed the combination and then forgot it

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
She said to him
I want you to be a father
Hes your little boy and you dont even bother
Like brother without the R
And hes starting to harbor
Cool on food for thought
But for you hes a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know hes much smarter
But hes hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter
Burst to tears let him know shes serious
Now hes fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
Cause you aint never pick him up
You see what his problem is
He dont know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
Its making a hole youve been digging it
Cause you aint been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasnt supposed to get introduced to that
He dont deserve to get used to that
Now I aint asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it aint sunny but it aint so hard
Just breaks my heart
When I try to provide and he say Mommy that aint your job
To be a man I try to make him understand
That Im his number one fan
But its like you booing from the stands
You know the world is out to get him so why dont you give him a chance

But I think I like her like a metaphorits hard to get
In the car we sit from the intro
She rolled down the window just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
Im calm a little more confident
Uh huh and then we lose consciousness
She says that Ive been waiting for you
And I know youve been chasing me too since they kidnapped
Me from a castle Ive been thinking of you
I told a firebreathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor yes you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said See Too beautiful to let you sleep
Youre my sunshine

Of numbers thats in the world just leave me a few

I keep him happy cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot cause I cant drive
Room enough for one I tell my homies they cant ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders but thats way too high
Lets try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now theres hoes selling hoes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
Theres crooked police thats stationed at the knees
And they do drivebys like up and down the thighs
And theres a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest Im sitting in my room
As Im looking out the face something to write about

Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain slowmotion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the babys sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tiptoe round creeping

Verse 1
He came back
In the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes he was still fresh to death
Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
He still had it cause they couldnt find it
And the bullets from his enemies
Sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy
From when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory
He didnt mind it
But he couldnt sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read I miss ya
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion
As he laid there soakin
He saw that the latch was broken
He kicked his casket open
And he

Verse 2
Not at all nervous
As he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldnt dirtspit he swallowed it
Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
Except his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined
Through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold
And almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave
And looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped
Six months after the shots
Thatd got him in the box
Wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours
Because he wasnt older
Used some flowers
To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
So he

He begged for some change
To get him on the train
Damn that nigga stank
Is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt
But it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window
Of what he became
A long look
Wasnt shook wasnt ashamed
Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah and gettin back in his lane
Doin his thang
First he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block
It had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot
Where he was shot
Shocked
That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird being on the opposite
They figured that he wasnt from there
So they pulled out and robbed him
With the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said
Youre scared aint ya
He said
Hustler for death
No heaven for a gangsta

Now I aint trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hiphop yup because the women degraded
But Too hort made me laugh like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite I stated though I only recited half
Omitting the word bitch cursing I wouldnt say it
Me and Dog couldnt relate till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort of liked
Yeah further ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rapbased filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac
Nas It Was Written intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions religion ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot tap the world and listen
It dropped

My mom cant feed me my boyfriend beats me

My teacher wont teach me my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

Verse 2
I had a ghetto boy bop a JayZ boycott
Cause he said that he never prayed to God he prayed to Gotti
Im thinking Golly God guard me from the ungodly
But by my 30th watching of Streets is Watching
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into
And thought what constitutes a prostitute
Is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things
With the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said Dont knock it mind your business
His business isnt mine and that nigga pimping got it

Hook
They took my daughter we aint got no water
I cant get hired their cross on fire

My father aint seen me
Turn off my TV cause it hurts me soul

Sitting on chrome 24inch wheels

In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
Made me a ripper deliver like river

We came through the storm
Nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the Pentagon lawn
Wake up the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty aint learned to walk already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflauged Torahs Bibles and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven
And let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpretated reasons for warfare
Reread them with blind eyes
I guarantee you theres more there
Rich must be blind
Cause they aint see the poor there
Need to open up a park
Just close ten schools we dont need em
Can you please call the fire department
Theyre down here marching for freedom
Burn down their tepees
Turn their TVs on to teach em
And move

The more money that they make

See that we all brothers

Strapped with a bomb on a bus

Give you the jitters
Just imagine an Americanbased

Planning to poison water supplies
To bring the second coming quicker

Intro
What down Charlie
How you doing Good hey what up Joe
Im just chilling know what Im saying chilling aint nothing yo
I said nah man theres people out there better than me
I just do what I do you know what Im saying Yeah aight

Verse 1
Uh I cant feel a field nigga pain
Devious skill that make a strong willed nigga wane
Since a lil nigga hang with the killers and distributers of caine
They dismemberers of swishers then refill it with the Jane
Then they tilt it and they lit it with a flame
Then they took a pull of killer to the brain like inhale noise ah
Evil minded like Krang they became
They deranged like the Rover that I rode
That was the Range that I drove when I was a little bit older mayne
Declaring war on the deck like they The Joker
All while ducking from Bruce Wayne
While they polka with the devil in our moonlitten ghetto
Hello My Name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was all back of a nickel like Monticello
When the underworld had to be smarter than Donatello
No honor amongst fellows
Its harder than sitting with a blind man and trying to describe yellow
Got me feeling like killer Joe
My life the album know the classics by heart
And exactly how the filler go
Repeat it on my way to the liquor store Charlie

Interlude
Whats up whats down what down
You know how are you  what you in for  stupid niggas
You know Im sayin its why I do what I do
I be aight we all be aight
We just gotta learn how to stay in our lane
And do what we know how to do you know

Verse 2
Cause I cant feel the field nigga chains
Though I covet mine so I covered mine in blame
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hun and uncovered minor game
Diamonds then under minded mayne
They give a nigga with no mack another kinda game
See money talks in another kinda slang
Detectives cant decipher as they listen through the wire as I accept the call
And listen to the lifer
Getting religion making wudhu in the sink of your cell
Reciting AlFatiha in the kitchen
Indeed on his deen and in addition to doing dishes
Listen as I give school on the rules to rule
The fuel of fools the obstacles the cool
Had to slow it down homie
Chopped and screwed he said blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only Gods words can stop the wolves
And dont fraternize with pigs those kidsll think your stool
Not at the bar but trying to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said borrow my jewels and bar the fools
Cause theyll play ya like the space bar in Tools
Theme music to a driveby put it in your car and cruise uh uh

With a tiger on his shirt alligator on his blues
With a nice young lady and some righteous kungfu
Im fighting without fighting enlightening you young fools
Frankensteins of mine I tighten you young screws
Send lighting to your mind and make you move
Car like cannonball run
Im lighting my guns fuse one
That mean Ill lean and leave you I mean this Needlz
They hook to my hooks they rehearse my verse

Reverse the fifteen teen is so serve
The serve is so mean like I served in the marines
And its full metal jacket
Upset the jokers every time I draft it
They trys to jack it change my will
I can wait for triple A I remain I chill
Even still niggas dont know the drill
And I mean it needles
Just hook em with my hooks they rehearse my verse

I lead them through the harm like a Hero
Peaceful
But I can bring the violence like Nero
Right to your keyhole then bring it back to silence
Cause thats the GCode

But tell the polices I aint seen it because I had it

Featuring Howard Zinn
Album Friend of the People I Fight Evil
    
Howard Zinn
We have to stop wars we have to stop this war
And we have to get out the habit of war
Its more than a habit its an addiction
We have to get out of thinking that we must be a military superpower

We must get out of thinking that we must have military bases as we have in a hundred countries
Is it possible that having military bases in a hundred countries arouses a lot of antagonism
Is it possible that it promotes terrorism when your soldiers and your sailors are all over the world occupying this country and that Is it possible

Why do we have to be a military superpower
Why cant we be a humanitarian superpower
Instead of sending planes for bombs
Why dont we send planes for food and medicine

Soldier One
Oh shit its one of the machines
Looks like its trapped under something its broken or something

Soldier Two
Lets get out here  we cannot stay

Soldier One
Hold on lemme get my keyboard I can reprogram this thing

Soldier Two
It doesnt matter Leave it

Soldier One
No seriously I can do it  just give me a second

Computer  continuously
Reprogramming unsuccessful

Machine  continuously
Enemy  I kill people

Soldier One
I swear to God man I can do this I can do this
Cross your fingers
You have to work
All right this is the last time

Intro

Verse 1
Yield to the forces of darkness
I bring you the torches of our shit
Reinforced with hardness of Wolverines
Arms with the harshness and overall sharpness
Now how far do the arms get
My nigga from the stars to the starfish
From the baby to the Bar Mitz
Its a whole lot of light and a whole lot of arm length
My arms long but Im lawless
A strong arm I can lift up all this
You gon have to build a bigger farm fence
To keep them wolves out of Old MacDonald barn bitch
Yeah Team Jacob
Were long armed put my hands on a lear
Everytime I put my hands in the air
Watch the throne as I dance in the chair
Throw my crown in the crowd hope it lands on the heir
The weak niggas like to pass interfere
Spit a lot of meh over jams of the year
That act like the man up in here
That dont count when your only real fan is a mirror
Thats subliminal to any nigga that he feel he is too
But you dont stand a chance playa
I am there ChiTown fan of the Bears
Love where they dance in the square
Yeah Yankees too but only cause Granderson there
And now wears khaki pants on La Brea
We all friends why your man lookin scared
Turning whiter than Anderson hair
Came out the garage like he saw a phantom in there huh

Verse 2
Old shit alert Louis clothes
Callin women bitches Louboutins and Gucci shows
Well I guess there goes my Louis shows
More old shit if your role models a movie role
And if you live your life like its a studio
Talkin to us like we mics a bunch of you aint do befo
Electric fences for a urinal
Also keep a toaster in my jacuzzi yo
Shockazulu call me Wasalu II
Oh shit man these record labels prostitute you
Strap them to sushi bars and feed em lots of fugu
Catch a bad piece
You can stick that 360 between your asscheeks
Artists lets mobilize and unionize like the athletes
Radio is making our craft weak
Forced to repeat the same dumb shit that work
Only as hot as your last beat
And rappers they relating to that last piece
Album never leave they desk if you dont got no BDS
Sacrifice your publishin they said you really need a hook
And they aint gon pay you said that you received a look
And whats stupid real is what producers feel
Twenty placements or you stuck in that producer deal
And RB chicks so get it the wildest
All they money goes to hairdressers and stylists
Gotta keep up with that image
Label lose they mind if they ever see a blemish
ProActiv and peels airbrushers and trainers
Managers suggest you fuck a nigga to be famous huh
But its all entertainment
Wonder when Cobain blew out his brains did he blame it
And if those snakes in the industry helped him aim it
Started pressing up records before the bullet left the chamber
I fight evil everyday Im livin
Rest in peace to men women and the children
And middle fingers to the Pilgrims that killed em

Lets begin this interview I know they got a lot of questions

This where I step in cause this Dosage from Philly and he so sick
And he my friend so he yo friend its who Lupe Fiasco with
They wanna know if Im insane I just dont accept defeat
But since Im nominated this is gonna be my acceptance speech
Your big bro requestin me cuz Im a friend of the people and Im next to be
In the game I dont hear the referees whistling technically
Dixie let me sing
I wish I was in the land of cotton old times they are not forgotten Look away Look away Look away I forever see
Dont go back or forever be a slave to the nation
Touch Lupe this is history in the making

Verse 3 Lupe
We so in Smithsonians when the story ends
We was there when the story started making history before wes artists
You know wes targets Target its always star shit
Or shall I say hotwired ride around reckless and doublepark it

Then go to court just to get up on some smart shit

Verse 1
Laid back villain on the smooth tip
All things gravy greatest fear to let the groove slip
Always tell the masses that its never gon stop
Cause you never gon do shit
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs
Mop up sop up the tears for fears with a Qtip
They proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick
Remember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick
Or when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched
Sent the tape to Bill Duke wouldve went to jail
If he wouldnt have got killed in that driveby by the dude he kicked
Cuz he was like It aint mine
And she was like You the only guy that I do it with
Remember when Pac and Q start fightin over Steels house
They broke a vase Steel scream Raheem told em to chill out
The jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips
The same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip
And wan it sad how Loco had the habit
And wan it funny when they caught TBone dancing with that rabbit
Didnt Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnsons son in the back with
Or do I got it backwards
And Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass
And Caine put his fist up and dapped it
And Chicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck
They left his ass he reached down to get his hairbrush
And Tr lied to Furious sitting down get his hair cut

Chorus
Yeah do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese huh

Verse 2
Caine told him as he jacked him at the drivethru
A hundred bucks will tell who Radames put the knife to
Another hundred for the cop who chased New Jersey Drive crew
The group who took Ricky ball Crip or Piru
Kicked Doughboy and told him he could buy a hundred balls
Little Bobby used his bed to iron out his overalls
Who knew in a few he would have a gun aimed
Caine had a niggas Daytons skatin on his Mustang
Remember when the whole crowd stopped and got tense
Then they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence
Then when Gee Money first got married to the cocaine
And Chris Tucker ODed there watching Soul Train
Camron shot him in the car and took his gold chain
Nino was free till he met up with that old man
And IceT was there and he oversaw the whole thing
Mello lost his legs just to get up out the dope game
Why he throw his gun into the river though
Just to hit the roof to get the juice and let Bishop go
Show Hodges love but the Pac Man day came
Specially after sprayed little ese with the spray paint
Remember when Bobby took off his tear
And when Doughboy disappeared
After his brother died and he said nobody cared
I still do after all these years
Because he shouldve played ball
Ricky aint deserve none of that at all
These are just a illustration
Of a few scenes that helped raise a generation

Chorus
Yeah do you remember these
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese
Double burger with cheese huh

Welcome to my whirlwind turn like TiltAWhirls

Going out we goin in say hello to my girlfriend
Vomiting and conquering that CClass is a girl Benz
My class is overseas I be on all around the world rims
Womens international my will is like my girl then
Goin in is goin wild goin in is goin strong
Going for the gold some worldclass goin in is goin on
I can do this all day I aint got it all kay
They all say Im one wall short of a whole hallway
One Halls short to keep from coughing all in yall face
Man Im so appalled I can keep them all safe
I can really ball and put titties all in yall face
That was Robert Paulson and that deserves a pausin
So thats Blart Pierce and all thats missing is a bearer
For the coffin that is needed for this beat when Im done talkin
Balling in the morning this feel like my callin
This the new bitches brew fall off in my cauldron
Lupes going crazy Flow is going almonds
We going back to goin in you gonna need a Garmin
Then go and get a car to put your Garmin and my broad in
Destination everywhere reputation everywhere
Music drop music stop one man take up every chair
I know that that aint very fair how one man take up everywhere
But it aint for long though itll be some closure
Or maybe Ill be everywhere after Im all over
Say goodbye then start the show fall on off then start to blow
Acting like Im rapping its that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow
Flow is in the microwave call it Michael Tyson flow
Killing is a dirty job Michael Myers Michael Rowe
Bring it back like Michael Fox see how far them Michaels go
I feel like Im Michael Crichton writin with a microphone
I aint saying you should die but you should leave your life alone
Maybe borrow one of mine fast life life at home
Life is like a box of chocolates pockets full of Toblerones
Pocket full of wallets so what continent we shopping on

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Excuse me Lupe Huh This here is your conscience
Supplier of your fire and provider of your content
They really dont want none of you lets put them in a convent
You are such a handful you can call us palm prints
They cant get a handle try to run around my track
And you might get a ham pulled swag I got a vanfull
Plus a motorcycle and a tow truck my sedan pull
I am like a Superman just without the damn U
Flow is tied around the track something like a damsel
Flow is really manly though see that was an example
Remember that for later though because I might exam you
Get ready for your testsss his excellence commands you
See thats how I get it done effortless and ample
Means I got a lot of that no camel toe or Monistat
No pussy in my program worldwide
Let em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Put in my work and punch the clock like Riddick Bowes hands
See my pot is overflowing can I put some work in your pan
Yeah yeah I am such a dope man
Kitchens really happy you should come and see my stove dance
Movie of the week I call it Beauty and the Beast
And that theres just the kitchen you should see just where I sleep
Crib is on some other shit mind is on the mothership
Brain is on my sister boat thoughts is on my brother whip
Fitted hat is Reynolds Wrap cause I dont trust the government
See Im not just touching it Im clutching it with oven mitts
Shit get hot this wristwatch looks like its a club in it
Like the way I emcee man they just be lovin it
Used to be a pushover now Im into shovin shit
You be on your glory hole you dont know who you fuckin with
Stay off in that story mode I never like a quick game
Came in with a big blast go out with a big bang
You might catch some whiplash every time I switch lanes
See I drive a bit fast nigga kinda insane
Career on stilts Braveheart no kilt
You can hear it screaming freedom as the beat get killed

Intro
Really
This is what you guys been doing
Seriously

Hook 1
Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
From moon to sun it goes on and on
The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on and on
Come on woman in your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity
Become a woman in your own time
Far far far from the virgin vine
Rise on out from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh she sings her favorite song
Left with tears and dreams it goes and then on

Verse 1
Standing in line for the new one
Not the black but the blue one
And I dont even know what it do son
But Steve Jobs said that its too fun
Fun in abundance what I need
Its cold out here put my arms in the sleeves
Ill probably lose my place if I leave
But I really need to pee
If I do it right here theyll see
Makes you wonder how do snipers
Marathon bikers
Next time diapers
They say it has all new features
Faster processors and much better speakers
Great for kids a necessity for teachers
For work or home
A revolutionary way of being alone
I mean should we really get a loan
Hey whats the matter just tell it to your phone
Cupertino heart with Chinese parts
Built by the poor but designed by the smart
They opening the door so you go
On your mark get ready set buy
Imagine a world where everything starts with an i
But it still ends with a die
Probably got an app for that you could try
From the iClouds right into the great WiFi
Siri can iGod really hear me
Does not compute  can you repeat more clearly
Woaaaaah

Hook 2
A vessel in the bloodline
A thirteenth Zodiac sign
A stitch in time it goes on and on
Become a woman on your own time
Far far far from the virgin vine
Rise on out from the dead leaves
Come back to me
Oh she sings her favorite song
Left with tears and dreams it goes and then on

Verse 2
Standing in line for some new Ones
Had a bunch of blessings but I blew them
Asked Google how to use them
They sent me to a section bout used guns
New runs nunsll scream moms with jeans
Match their teens jeans and genies who try to chew gum
Aw man its so confusin
Confusion in abundance what I have
Good thing that God accept cash
Maybe buy my way up out His wrath
Skeptically why am I way up off this path
Atheisms cheaper and accepts Visa
My thoughts as Im queuing up for sneakers
Wont discriminate  Im getting all eight
In every color that they make
Beaverton hearts with Chinese parts
Built by the poor and designed by the smart
On your mark get set cop em
Imagine a life that revolves around shoppin
Conspicuous consumption
That means it serves no other function
But to show off to someone or others
Who only try to show off to you  look at your fellow loyal customers
Isnt harmony great
Look at all these friends that marketing makes
How many fries can these arteries take
Ill give McDonalds a little help here
I think they should expand into healthcare
And then youll have all ends covered
Even make caskets have it all umbrellad
Can you make the corporation fear me
Couldnt hear your order can you speak less clearly

Hook 3
That which was put in the ground
Will someday come back around
From dust to dust it goes on and on
Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
And still the story goes on and on

Hook Ellie Goulding
I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And Im not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And Im not keeping up
The strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when Im alone
And so I tell myself that Ill be strong
And dreaming when theyre gone
Cause theyre calling calling calling me home
Calling calling calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when Im alone

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
So what are you going to stand for
Dreads in the sky I and I 2 new Vans on a land four
Take that back make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a neverbackdownfrommystance tour
Yeah touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan or  wait let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and youll never touch the floor
Woah now if Noah need a rower
Ill be there with my oar till we get back to the shore
Dad made me a soldier GI Joe to these Cobras
Tryna FBI my Panther CIA my Sankofa
Infiltrate my Carter illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubbas mothers
Take the hero out the Nino keep it real as troubletrouble huh
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them 45s or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know thats contradiction wants and needs in competition
But its hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise proceed with that conscious eye
New gang alert hashtag occupies
Repper til the death of me FnF whats left of me
All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestles when Im wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know that that dont mix like ecstasy and ketamine
Funny how Im only sick if you never catch a thing
Argue with your friends over what really the record means
Back and forth about its course with professors refereeing
Why he so rebellious Upfront with his realness
They wanna be fiascoes reproduce his failures
Emperor is his alias but not Marcus Aurelius
This is more like Sparta kick you down a well kid
And on my last check I copped the NSX just like Pharrell did
Well did better doings to come
My only promise is Ill never ruin the young
Ill never human the sung lyrics in a spirit thats
Superhuman to some keep you pursuing the sum of
Slums plus get up out of them plus never forget
Just where you from plus make sure that youre ballin
When you come back up in them plus we dont die multiply
Every single comeup parumpapumpum yup

Life Death And Love From San Francisco
Lupe Fiasco
Album Friend of the People I Fight Evil
    
Verse 1
She said love is a hard thing
Somewhere between golfing and gardening
Or parole board pardoning
But she was still down for a hard swing
Flowers she would pick like guitar strings
For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a barteend
And pour hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before its time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see what a bum riding BART dreams
Before he get gunned down cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene
Around the time they kicked us out they had the park cleaned
She aint living in a car she just RVing
Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times tryna duck em like Darkwing
Known for burning clothes and petty carkeying
And other less harmful skylarking
Bought a bag out of American Rag
A small Chinesemade American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half
The picture that she bought wouldnt fit in the cab
On the train trying her best not to live in the past
A bum probably asked could he spit in her ass
And that was it fits tantrums random
HelterSkelter a world gone Manson

And Ill spare you the details
Dinner is ceviche out of seashells
Annoyed cause her date really cant speak well
But she forced to press on like Lee Nails
Next table was abhorred by the weed smell
She was done at the moment that the tee fell
A thick wool jacket on a cool night
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight
Doesnt satisfy her like a game of pool might
Thinking what if Fantasia had a broom strike
Tuned right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like
She said Absurd last words from a dude off a Zoosk site
And then left him
Like the Roots left Geffen
And the state Howlin Wolf left Chess in
Stop to watch flows have an unpaid session on the steps of a Westin
She really need to check in
And to apologize to her best friend
New bras to put her chest in
Love life and death in

Walk right into Philippes when I ran outta Chows

Mayweather on the speedbag
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has
Thats how the hood sound
Grew up in the hood town

Black skies lookin up crack pipes lookin down
Accused of not lookin back blind nigga look around
City on my back so the CHI go errywhere Im at
Presence so shiny Mercedes so matte
Cop that from Platinum the color of my plaque
I memorize Colors off of Yo MTV Raps
A nightmare walking in a psychopaths nap
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab
Guess whos sneaking in the weed bags
That be me with my me ass
Not tryna be anything but free as
Flow is so nuts the track is gettin teabagged
Just wanna rap nice that aint me  tag
If you wanna be mean then you wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You cant understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and Im a mother lovin mirrorfull
Bein dope is all in the muscle
Its more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants and bowlin ball juggle
So dont be scared to take the Super Lu route
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out
School ya on your history I tell ya what you bout
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out
Pharrell what these niggas talkin bout
2 man Big Pun a 1 man Slaughterhouse
A 2 album JayZ a 1 nigga WuTang
Young and hungry Mos Def a conscious rappin Lil Wayne

A Jesus in the desert walking Dundee walkabout
A self imposed exile learn to let the awesome out
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house
Cause the world is mine Lupe to the rescue the world is fine
Words and lines of mine I feel are better than every rap in the world combined
And thats how you do it

Stupid with the raps but the raps never stupid

My cooler closed airconditioned seats
I dont trust them niggas they conviction weak
They be thawing out my commitment keeps
Twelve months hope that well jumps
Seems like selling souls is havin sales bumps
I be in to win while your sales slump
Your chances getting slim mine on their 12th brunch
And they smell lunch Hercules Klump
Throw my weight around
Aint left the scale once
Always bear in mind even with your white fur
We still polar opposites you ice picks to icebergs
Im colder than Universal Soldier
Angel on my back everywhere Im at
Niggas dont believe it just when I lay it down
And when I get back up and see my angel on the ground

Chicken soup for souls now who could use a bowl
Dont be salty now trying to reduce my snow
Cause I just move em out Ice Man
Fresh out a mutant school I aint no student though
Black Shaun White and he skis and he skates
And he leaves all types of cold tracks all behind me
And you can follow those if you ever wanna find me
Better dress warm or you might end up like the Shining
Not that boy or that lady but that nigga gone crazy
Pretty damn amazing I cant get out
So Im forced to ride this elevator anywhere it takes me
But when I hit my flow Ima open up that door
Wont be three stacks or your cousin but just that super cold

Now isnt that fun
You just wanna make the world better isnt that young
Well blessings to the youth then

And exactly where I started is exactly where I leave it
Cause I aint never ever ever change

Things are getting outta control
Feels like Im running out of soul oh woah oh oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think Ill be letting you go oh woah oh oh

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Selfabsorbed with his own selfforfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike
We was tight seeing lights speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I dont get high Life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted trying to fall asleep Lost inside my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now burnin all my motives down
Inspiration drying up motivation slowing down

Hook Lupe Fiasco
Things are getting outta control
Feels like Im running out of soul oh woah oh oh
You are getting heavy to hold
Think Ill be letting you go oh woah oh oh

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Im begging me dont let me go we vow like the letter O
To never go our separate ways and spinoff into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits livin off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow cant wait for the exit hole
Give me room the entry wound Let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is unprepared and filterless
Magnify the youth in me alibi the shootin spree
Amplify the revolution sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers shootin out of you and me

Hook Lupe Fiasco

Bridge Lupe Fiasco
Sometimes I feel like the world
Sometimes I feel like the world is against me
And everything that Ive done before

But we cant be in love no more

I turn around and pick up one

As I drown in my regrets
I cant take back the words I never said

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip
911 building 7 did they really pull it
Uh And a bunch of other coverups
Your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts then wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place thats on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it then they move it so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV all you sees a bunch of what the fucks
Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
And that aint Jersey Shore homey thats the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed Obama didnt say shit
Thats why I aint vote for him next one either
Im a part of the problem my problem is Im peaceful
And I believe in the people yeah

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Now we can say it aint our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war wheres that in the worship
Murdering is not Islam and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel dont take my side cause look how far youve pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for
Complain about the gloom but whend you pick a broom up
Just listening to Pac aint gon make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts aint gon make it halt
If you dont become an actor youll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects take em when the pains felt
Wash them down with diet soda killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment they can take your home away

Hook Skylar Grey
Its so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I cant take back the words I never said

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion thats why I despise it
We scared of almost everything afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me Im scared of even telling you
Sometimes Im like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
Im locked inside a cell in me I know that theres a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out so take a breath inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free my thoughts is finally yelling through

Hook Skylar Grey
Its so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I cant take back the words I never said

Man now aint that cold
Im just tryin to talk to my homie thats up in the hole
And homegirl not tryin to be a ho even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance No
Whoa like the opposite of go
That aint how its supposed to be or butterfly
But for the sake of rhymin lets just say butterflyee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell em tell em dont homicide me
Im just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin for his fans and fightin for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block em out then I could knock em out and
Dance around the ring but until then Ill sing

Verse 2
Doctor doctor please the fame aint painless enough
Thats cause you aint famous enough
You got a little game but your name aint ringin enough
He said Take two of these put some change in my cup
I said I wasnt poor he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
Out ouch Im tellin you this all from a therapists couch
Tell me about your mother what shes all about
Prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
Damn jeez
The world is so cold Im glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Rendered unconscious they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots

Verse 3
And when I finally make it Ima stunt so hard
Evil as Knievel Ima jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere I aint comin back
Be a jerk to them jerks yeah thatll make em hurt
Huh said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me so I started to tear up
He said You need to cheer up your mind need to clear up
Youre already here just be yourself from here up
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Somethin I was taught somethin I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from

Get your respect but lose all my worth no
You can dead that get a hearse go

Know it hurts but I really dont care though
Let me rub it in get it all up in that ho

Youre way too late youll be trapped here forever
Theres only 2 ways out of here
Ones through the door the others through me

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Sometimes living in a world like this
Its pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you dont comply
Pretty easy if you dont complain
Stand there like you dont feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend til the end that you dont fear change
Dont admit that your faith is weak
Dont say that you feel like dying
Lifes hard then it feels like diamonds
Your homes just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Cant understand what Im saying
Cant figure out what Im implying
If you feel you dont wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
Im on the dark side
And you cant come find him
How when its light all around you
Yeah But its dark all inside him
No winners when its me against me
One of us just aint gonna survive
My heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin me alive

This world is such a fucked up place
My minds such a fucked up shape
Everything down here sucks
Maybe whats up there is great
We all gotta go one day
I just wanna cut to the chase
I wanna stop these nightmares
I just wanna touch your face
All you see is all my feats
All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs
Door keep telling me to fight
Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things yea you really like summer
You really like music you really like reading
Love I cant win if its me against me
One of us aint gonna survive
And my heart been broke for a while
Yours been the one keepin me alive
Yours been the one keepin me alive
Yours been the one keepin me alive

You must be a radio station
And who are we we must be
A number one song spinnin all day long
And over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we dont win when we call in and nothings free
Sounds to me like
State run radio state run radio
State run radio state run radio
State run radio state run radio
State run radio state run radio

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
We interrupt this broadcast
To bring you this special message about the forecast
The futures cloudy and its raining on the poor class
Road to peace is closed heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is balling on a budget
The militarys says its gon need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas keep us in our hoods
And hope we never explore past stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learn in your class
That theres no treasure in your trash
And a Sealy has the same feeling as the floor has
And thats where you should stay this is what they play

Hook Matt Mahaffey
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we dont win
When we call in and nothings free
Sounds to me like
State run radio state run radio
State run radio state run radio

State run radio state run radio

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Youre now tuned into the weakest
Frequency of fear keep you locked right here
And hope you never leave this never be a leader
Think inside the box and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Hi youre on the air now what you want to hear
Well we aint got the truth but how about a remix
Different is never good good is only what we pick
You aint got a hit unless it sounds like these did
Not too smart you will be a superstar
And if you dumb it some maybe you could be number one

Hook Matt Mahaffey
Over again and over again
And over again and over again
And over again
And we dont win
When we call in and nothings free

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
So beware whats on the airwaves
And be more aware of whats not gettin airplay
Independent spirit you can barely hear what theyre sayin
Truth aint getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propagandas everywhere constantly on replay
All the hits all the time backtoback on relay
Were really where it lives make them hear the records we play
Build your own station become your own DJs

Bridge Matt Mahaffey
You must be a radio station
And who are we we must be
A number one song spinnin all day long
And you put me on daily rotation
Youre on the air we know youre scared
But we dont care well play this here

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Freedom we can use some of that especially where we from
Where we grew up like a green thumb
Its like a criminal is the only thing you can become
Look at what I became
Something like a phenom Nuthin but a G Thang
Things Ive seen when Im looking out of these frames
Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell a son
Who aint have a father
How to try to grow up and be one
See um feel it in my bones
That Im sitting on a throne
Like a killer with a chrome
When I spit another poem
Shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home pow

Hook Eric Turner
I waited all my life to play
I still cant find a way

Planes Im fly plus I dont write no more its all off of the top I shaved the braids
And stayed sharp mother knew how to raiseablade Razor Blade

Ask Lupe Im Sucre I aid the break
Quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai I like to travel light

In the webisode necklace stole let em know
That I put up the footage that Im takin your shine
Wanna see the real chains Look in your mind
Your brain look like Keenan Wayans brother
Overgold overload broken soul

Intro
Sometimes you just gotta 
Go

Hook
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Verse 1
Uh and we aint get exploited
White man aint fear it so he did not destroy it
We aint work for free see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by WEB Du Bois
Were no reconstructions civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill OReilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where Fox News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize

Hook
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Verse 2
Uh and it aint no projects
Keepin it real is not an understood concept
Yeah complexions not a contest
Cause racism has no context
Hiphop aint got a section called Conscious
Everybody rappin like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor Bloods to attack them
Matter of fact no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons
Eminem fitted in but then again
He inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic him
And thats what really rose up out of Michigan
The sounding white rapper by the name of 50 Cent

Hook
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Verse 3
Uh and I know its just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why cant it be
Now we can do nothing about the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman queen and every man a king and
When those color lines come we cant see between
We just close our eyes til its all black everything

Hook
You would never know what you could ever be
If you never try you would never see
Stayed in Africa we aint never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships were no misery
Call me crazy or isnt he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black everything

Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we wont erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
Ill never forget you
Ill never let you go
Ill never forget you
Ill always remember I hope you know

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward with every step
And lets push towards it never regress
And lets remember if ever we get
Down the places that we came from round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The upside of bad flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe and from this view we achieved
We looked back at the rules we received
And how we broke those dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos
Sounds of the summer day and go wise
Cold wind blowin through a city on fire
Moments of the past came here to find you
Not to relive them just to remind you

Hook John Legend
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we wont erase

Verse 2  Lupe Fiasco
And let the evidence show the futures so bright
Its never been more not like tonight
We walk into the glow right into the light
The past all around us the time of our life
The first love kisses the broke heart disses
This is just like a firstclass ticket
Back to the first written rap
The crumbledup paper and the pen with no cap
The handmedown clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at
Or to these are shades of my youth
Trials of a child everything truth
Moments of the past comin back to find us
Not to relive them just to remind us

Hook John Legend
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we wont erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad
Ill never forget you
Ill never let you go
Ill never forget you

Verse 3  Lupe Fiasco
Everything cherished remembered in my heart
So you will never perish you will never part
I tell em all about you drummin in the park
We put you in the ground but I see you in the stars
Gon take a bow a round of applause
The best dad ever always ready we are
Love always shines thats how Ill find you
In case you forgot I hope this reminds you

See that Im everywhere everywhere
Shining down on you

Verse 2
No I aint that nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines want this petition signed
It says Im sick of dying sick of this prison time
I really love my people Im sick of pimping mine
Now if we AutoTune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it just to shoe it like a blacksmith
Were trapped and moving round in circles like its Chapstick
And thats the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
Well wrap this around your head
Like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well Im not having it

So I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who aint never heard mine
And if you have then you know you aint never heard lying
Lu dont move no cowards you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher Id rather have the scars
I dont idolize America Im dancing with the stars
Uh huh All of them Yea they are too
You look up and you see us shining down on you

High as the eyelids of osprey
Im thriving
Poseidon your trident cant stop me from diving
Looking for my
Looking for my
Looking for my
As I float
Brand new shell for my ghost
Tattoos all on my coast

Interlude 1 Lupe Fiasco
Throughout history
It has been the inaction of those who could have acted
The indifference of those who should have known better
The silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most
This has made it possible for evil to triumph
Selassie

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Mans limitation transfiguration
Haka dance done at the welcome to the demo
Modern man comes to the weddin in the limo
Mixin doves with the rice rain
Uncle Bens off the rails on the night train
And that storm took us to the platform pushas
Back to the bachelors backdoor unhook us
Hope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us
And thats very old like Blackberry Bold but the juice
Sweeter than where the party at or
Releasing these niggas from the rooms and
Leavin these niggas on the loose or
Keepin these niggas in the coops and
Leavin these niggas on the noose free
Shamu fan got a world to see

Interlude 2 Lupe Fiasco
Then until the philosophy which holds one race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
That until there no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the color of a mans skin
Is of no more significance than the color of his eyes
Selassie

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
To the limit
The limit in the Methadone clinic
Ridin with the pack like a Peloton
Flyin with the sack in the trap like the pregnant
As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon
If I triple my worth will it cripple my mom
If I simple my search will it mental my calm
Will it hurt if I give you my palm
To tell in it dont put a nail in it
How you gonna see the world if you a whale in it
And readin my palms like theres braille in it
Is it the trail or the forest
Or the forest with the trail in it
Thats a sail with a 12 in it
Water coming through from impalin it
Water come through for me now
Nothin left of the boat but my oars
Still I fill up the world and I float like

Interlude 3 Lupe Fiasco
A qualified man with vision
Unmoved by daily selfish interests
Led to right decisions by his conscience
In general a man who knows from whence he comes
And where hes going
Will cooperate with his fellow human beings
He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties
But will inspire others by his good example
You are being watched by the nation
And you should realize
That you will satisfy it if you do good
But on the contrary you do evil it will lose its hope and confidence in you

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Come and bring the pieces to the master
He who organize by size then completes them with the plaster
Now what should we call it
After 12 cocktails prevails the inner alcoholic
Who knelt you by the toilets
Remember remember Just like the Knights of Malta
Niggas like their liquor malted manifested like a land without the Indian
Just all kith and foul kin
Whether Maltese or Millennium
Saucer Chaucer of the airwaves
Two assists one Senegalese but her hair beige
The others hairs shaved both standing at the bottom of the staircase poised
But boys too coy to look in their face
Oi bring the dowry you can have em
On annual sabbatical lookin lousy in the cabin
Groomins only prudent to continue working with humans
But aint no livin signals inside my circle of students

Lilies in the valley of my heart
Lay you on your back and fall apart
Lately I been looking at the spores
It got my mind going back to Cali after dark
I got a problem with commitment Id say
Laying here waiting on waves

Barriers and barricades
In the lilies in the valley of my heart

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Leave and take these pictures to the pawn shop
Tell em you want the same amount of money that the one got
Pull up on the side of his Ghost and let the Dijon drop
If they muster up the courage to murk us at the Quran swaps
For the ones that tell you how to orchestrate the bomb plots
Taught you well on how to tell the impostors
Made an inner city Mosque in Mississippi Madrassas
Much like differences in instances ittybitty is topless
That was food for the fingers
Dim the lights to set the mood for the singers
Who can turn the stage into a school for the redeemers
Like an agent teaching Afghans to use the tool with the stingers
Useful as a back tire to a flat tire
A bazookas your best friend until it backfires
Your strata needs a bunk bed ladder to climb up
And high hopes will put this whole matter behind us

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
Still debunking the myth of a sleepover
As the enola sneaks over
The seat thinking ricolas fixes Ebola
Hol up heathens and thieves in case police show up
Out the belly of the beast making the streets blow up
Blowing in her hands making the heat hold us in streaks
All my skills on the hilltop you can hear a quill drop
Spoon full of sugar help the pill pop
Let us Tetris little blocks until the bill clots
And then fill spots and make the field drop
Levels wearing the barons medals
Otherwise bare expect for a pair of petals
Somethin like a bear except hes wearing a pareo
Fair safe haven to take your share of De Niro
In his care might square to a pair of you share hold
Heavily invested to bury Harriets railroad

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Sinister times pacific the rims so I live in the mind
Sit in the head of the shit I design
Position it bent so I sit in recline
But never I sleep
Tears out the eyes is the weather I weep
Give cheddar to beggars to better my keep
Dont turn a back and never a cheek
Wont be here forever we sever we cease
A liar who said that we never release
Nooses surroundin the neck of the beast
Loosing they pounds on the treasure beneath
200 pounds under pressure decrease
Reducing the sound to a set of beliefs
Devils a trick like they sent the police
Is it or nahs Nas like wedded Kelis
So not the same like a Jet and a Jeep
One in the clouds the other up under him running around
Unlike the one never touching the ground
Some like the one cause it doesnt come down
Unlike the oven thats under the town
Liquor the fire they jump in and drown
Wait till they die its for something profound
Head is so dreaded for clutching the crown
And keeping it standing when jumping around
Feeding the animals touching the hounds
Eating with cannibals lunch in the lounge
Keeping it manual clutch in announced
Eating the actual reaping the benefits
Repeat the annual bleeping the fouls
Something about something about
Reaching the valuable touching the down

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Lovin the Lord
Covet the lovers of governor or
Dozen in love with the covets or more
In concerts with convertswhocover galore
Wash off they feet and then cover the floor
Mother the ships so come hover aboard
To raptures and ruptures start flooding the shore
Pushing and shoving and punching with oars
Thuggin and judging no plugging the holes
Sink to the bottom like sex in the kitchen no food in the fridge but its nut on the stove
Its what on the what
Like Monica sucking and bust right on her clothes
Dishonouring Monica what is it for
Monitor Monica what does she know
Finding the evidence answering the questions
Did you and the president fuck on the low
Room full of elephants elegant elements breaking it down she touching her toe
Triple A coming to give her a jump and her engine construction dont function no more
Its killing her options to live in a box when they filling their stockings with lumps of the coal
Finding the diamonds with dynamite fighting the fire is hiding while wiping the pole
Sliding off slightly to siphon the go
She biting her neck like she vampirelike aint no lighten her load
With the tide and a bleach at the laundromat black trying to whiten her clothes
So maybe she can sneak into heaven hmm yeah

Intro
I was born in a small village
I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers
Foreign soldiers
Torn from my elders I was made to speak their language
With each new post my masters changed
Along with the words they made me speak
With each change I changed too
My thoughts personality how I saw right and wrong
Words can kill
Time and again the country was ruled by a foreign tongue
When he was a young boy he lost his native language
The bedrock for any developing child
His country his family his face his identity
Everything was stolen from him

Verse 1
Meet me on the corner I be waiting on you
Thousand years of better right into forever
Fire on my feathers fall from out of heaven
Fight without a weapon life without a lesson
Lost Im my own boss pay my own cost
Fill my own goals see my own hopes
Tired of all of this wish I had a switch
One kiss then you cut me off
Knowledge is the power college is for cowards
Hollering for hours swallowing the sour
Skin stuck around the rims peeking in on a life so sweet
The other side made it why dont we

Interlude
From ancient times every civilizations ruler has had the same idea When people unite under one will they become stronger than the sum of their parts and what do rulers use to bring people together Language This world will become one I have found the way Race tribal affiliations national borders  even our faces will be irrelevant The world that the boss envisioned will finally become a reality and it will make mankind whole again

Verse 2
Found a friend in the words and my words and it works
Take away the pain take away the hurt
Make a way to make a change make it sane
Specially if you plan on staying on this Earth
Low to the lows high to the highs
Eyes to the sky strive to revive dying to survive
Pool full of cries but its cool Im still alive
And every breath is every left soul
And the family never kept whole
In the slum want to quest to be the best of being less
Never let go the best road to the next level
And the scenes where its mean to do the right thing
Not to be a good king but the best devil
So its horns for the crown torn from the ground
Roses by the roots stolen from the roofs on parade days
Look at them rain down
I was brought here a slave
But I leave here a pharaoh

Interlude
America is a country of liberty a meeting of immigrants
Instead of simply assimilating its citizens live alongside others
So the major sought a system that used information
Words to control the subconscious
In his eyes the greatest symbiotic parasite the worlds ever known isnt microbial  its linguistic
Words is what keep civilization our world alive

When it took twenty minutes just to download one
Aye you got a fine face also a dime in your behind
Please can I find some time space to find base
Kinds of rhymes to describe how youre designed great
And maybe remove the mind freight
Like its overhead cranes at the train yard

Before the aliens came part
Remember that Oh not a fan of the scifi
Like dialups not a fan of the wifi

And its 1972 and Im some longhaired high guy
Driving a Volkswagen Beetle off into the California twilight
I usually got top cause Im a guy right
But if youre gay thats straight too
Hey I dont hate I got a couple of friends who went bi twice
Did that arrive right
Do you like whole stories or just the highlights
Cause I like to write your life story on the sky
Made of Lite Brights remember those

You were a ten ten years ago
Am I right who you calling

Where your Mother lives with your brothers kids
Because he locked up cause

Do you flicker like Liberace Sequins

Metabolize on the scattered snare
With the banana pies that he dont like
Like mosquito bites on the shins or ankles
In the end it bends
Lets begin and pretend its tranquil
Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion
Carved in the wall by the pond
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines
Ergo sum empire not the inch but the entire
More pills mean more spills by the whore house with the extra door
To let the divorced out with force
And other course routes of course
Cleopatra speaking patois with a mouth full of that jerk chicken
With rum in hand for the curse lifting
Onion bread with the shine to it
Its up and fair to define stupid
But she aint dumb at least she know that he aint fun
And neithers Europe even to the Middle Eastern tourists
Where oil is spent by the drum load
How many millionaires can the slums hold
Potentially all of us this whole plane and all the bus
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust
You strain to see through the fog of dust
Like spaghetti for the meatballs
Of dust Parmesan immaculates
Head over heels like a back is flipped
The Japanese dont perceive Atlantaness
Love labors get her backstage like the judge chambers
Everyone under the sun loves hugs from a young stranger
Or do us oh foo us
On boats in the Bay of Pigs
Runaways wait with the wayward kids
And the underpaid slaves from Jamaican gigs
Dont shoe us cause we aint Bush
We aint hoofs dont boo us cause we aint cooked
But who else could hook the fufu up
In this book I mean dumplings with dark continents
Dumb things even bar common sense
Sometimes sometimes sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents
Detergents deterrents and permits to build a hut
Twerk team Operation BuildaButt
Great like Gildersleeve
As a king breathes through a silver sieve
Jack and Jill aint up that hill enough
Filtering lean through a gold grill
Theorize things from swole hills
They came became what that po kills
Throw ho drills on that hotel thatll oil spill
Looking at space from a submarine
Putting that bass in the club machine
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face aint no love between
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings
Flying round town in a tub of wings
Found out how to make love to fiends
He mixing that fudge with the drug of dreams
She too teenage to have a drug of choice
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit

Okay okay okay check this out listen

Verse 1
Cold killer bold old guerrilla
Bold as a font with the thickness
Old as yellow gold in a Chevrolet with a stick shift
The story goes his mother left him on a church step
First step was out the front door then the first left
Down the block to the spots where the worst kept
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper
To shoot up the scene and scheme
Plot broken all down to two rounds of scotch
A pound means now and we too down to stop
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops
Military grade these things shoot round the block
Shh threat check
The dame will hang out like chains round the neck
He ever seen her before her face dont connect
No so keep it on the low go
Seizes her by the arm
Looks right into the eyes cause these be the charms
Sheba King Tut suite at the Khalifa
Tied to a chair getting burned by Cohibas
A well dressed thug who run clubs in the Koreas
The room smells like fresh hand made tortillas
He recognized the tattoos of a real big Maui brother
Known for bad news when his cash rules
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb
White girls enter drunk he stands up runs to the window and jumps
Aim for the pool splash
The impact from that almost split him in half
Voice from the past asks did he enjoy the bath
Laughs with his arm in a cast hold up

Its never what it seems everybody wanna be seen

Everybody wanna sip lean
Everybody want a big dreams
Everybody want bling bling
Everybody want CREAM
Everybody wanna have a team
Everybody wanna be the king
Everybody want a big scheme in the land of pyramid schemes

Verse 2
As he tried to do the math with Smearcon the fed
The contract states from here upon youre dead
The girl at the bar is an underworld star
Settling on debts with north Zanzibar
Your names on the list kitsch
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish
Tuna Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya
Youre hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumuah
They want your head on a platter not right now but sooner
I got you a 45 and a Mitsubishi tuner
Wait wait Ive never been to Costa Rica
And then it all comes back
Just as Smearcon falls with a ninja star in his head likehuh
Then they slowly enter the room
I grabbed a 45 the ninja stars resume
I catch him in the cast and answer them with a blast blow
Three more shots for good measure
Only exit is another window pfft whatever
Short fall to the roof of the car
Then I get in left arm covered in ninja stars
Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick
Look around the car for something else to kill with
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through
Especially with just one hand
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs
So they gaining heavy raining
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming
Arm paining blood draining
Pains head for the Louvre
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves
A little shook from the landing
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling
Was at the Mona Lisa
Stop the car right in front of the Delacroix and have a breather
Press play on the radio voice from the speaker
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers
But I follow the leader
1995 S Class in the back seat is a dead man whose car I just crashed
Smearcons alive audience now wonders how Smearcon survived
Let alone not be hurt he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work
What Visine for red retinas what else would you expect from head predators
Exlecturer at Exeter the dean too secular
So now Im totes hecklers everywhere
Now Smearcons on the team so everybodys down for the scheme

Interlude 1
The final chapter in the incredible ape saga
Smearcons back

Verse 3
Now its time to finish this getting too late for international syndicates
To which the driver reveals his membership

Damn you all to hell

Interlude 2
Wait what happened Uncle Lupe whats going on
Go to sleep
But what happened I dont understand
Nope
Please finish the story please
Storytimes over
You asked for a story I gave you one
Take it just take it
This is the worst bedtime story ever
Bye

Verse 4
Psych sucker Smearcon is back
You really think that he would go out like that
Theyre under attack MAC under the back

Verse
They thought it was cool to burn crosses on your front lawn as they hung you from trees in your backyard
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded Katrina
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire Virginia Tech Columbine stop the violence
They thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos gentrification
They think its cool to stand on the block hiding product in their socks to make quick dime bag dollars
They think its cool to ride down on you in blue and white unmarked cars busting you upside your head

Verse 1
I love the Lord
But sometimes its like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach baby thats law
But she doesnt see therefore I spoil
I trick I fall run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein every vessel every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene the obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen I could be her king together
She would make me cool and we would both rule forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure ever again
And if the rain stops and everythings dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
Shed teach me how to fly even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe shed retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell and Ill be

No weather man could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard umbrella whatever put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
Cause you gon need a sub til he does reply
And not one of Jareds you think its all arid
And everytings irie another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger Felix
Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving upandcomers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and welltodo mommas
But not well enough to keep em from us
The ones that were fighting in class who might not pass

Can you feel it Thats what I got asked
Do I love her Said I dont know
Streets got my heart game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying dishonored baby mama
Whos the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby but what about lately

Come these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool

And no one will receive thee
So shed no tear when were not here

And they wanna know oh oh oh the return
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show oh oh oh yeah

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Yeah uh a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone check 212
Wanna believe my own hype but its too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you
Did you improve on the design did you do something new
Well your name aint on the guest list who brung you
You the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me Im too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung Blue
Go back whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven the devil on me two tons too
Ha ha ha hahaha

Hook Matthew Santos
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the cameras here

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five unless its pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now thats important to say
Cause even with all that most of us dont want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience aint fazed
And they aint gonna clap and they aint gonna praise
They want everything back that theyve paid
Cause theyve been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha hahaha

Hook Matthew Santos
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show oh oh oh yeah

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause Ive been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security aint getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown MMs are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror dont flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs her favorite song and mics dont feedback
All the reviewers say You need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like Ha ha hahaha

We can make a hundred grand spend it in the south of France
Nothing further I jumped grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
Thats when I heard murder
Youre killing me youre filling me with sorrow
Sunrise goodbyes and missing you tomorrows
I turn to see my dream love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash thats faster
Than 180 on that dash shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
Yous the dame whos the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love love

Hook
Lets go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo

Verse 2
So lets keep it real all in together Free Chill
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Dont wake me til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap they applaud they love me my God
Otsukaresama deshita or maybe au revoir
A spree on SaintHonor then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been and
Everything that I done and
Tell her that shes the one and umm

Guess whos back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams fore I went to sleep
To lala land to count them sheep

Its got to be a prophecy for us to stay together evermore
For better or less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure Xs on the shore
I know my world tours like war to you
But Ian said Aloha and Harley said Cheers
Julian said Bonjour Big O was like Yeah
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership all for My Tenderness

In your heart and on your mind
So as I taxi down another runway

Album Lupe Fiascos The Cool

Intro Matthew Santos
Tonight tonight tonight
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
The plan is arriving and shes out there smiling
The fear is upon us the skies tried to warn us
The parents are goners no children to mourn us
Its driving me crazy this war is my lady
Weve lost all our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer the slip of the rhymer the pimp and the riser
Your cross there youll find her
Hey hey

Hook Matthew Santos
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Dangers at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Dangers at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Disease the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines remedies and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Dont let them in not a friend not a reflection
Everybodys got it and want you to have it next and
Dont accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say its an exit and some say its an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say its psychological war
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue some say the skies some say the floors
Whores say the nuns nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls
The preacher man said its going to kill off the soul
A bum said its going to kill the whole wide world

Hook Matthew Santos
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Dangers at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Dangers at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
Believe so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it it reports back
Everything in your mind everything is lying
Everything is dying everything is a rule
Everything is a crime everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
And she likes it and she loves it
The sadness the madness the bad shit
The lavish the fastest the clashes the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said shes all inside my mind
The little boy said What happened to all the girls
The preacher man said Shes going to kill off your soul
The dope boy said Its the whole wide world

Intro
Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed a candy shop told her Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag take the pennies out the drawer
Lil Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck in the school is his black book bag
His black nail polish black boots and black hair
He gon blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then we can get a soccer ball
Thats what my commander say
How old Well Im like ten eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I dont know much about where Im from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but Im still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If Im in your dreams then your end is near its me

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a little loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson that struggles little recruits
Cute smileless heartless violent
Childhood destroyed devoid of all childish ways
Cant write their own names
Or read the words thats on their own graves
Think you gangsta popped a few rounds
These kidsll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down
Its little weapon

Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim my hole right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs press pause for your moms
Make the room silent she dont approve of violent
Games she leave resume activity
Start in blue heart subpar sharp wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the little persons murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder hes only seconds older
Than me we playful but serious
Now keep that on mind for online experience

Grams man he had a whole lot of these
And he would let you hold like a whole lot of kis

He was a heart breaker
And a law shaker
If it was about caking he was a partaker
International he would take trips
Bon voyage thats how hard he was fishing for the chips
So greedy never gave to the needy thats what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hanging in the subways
He called em fruits and laughed at em
Delivery man on the pickup
Drive through and throw a bag at em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Making a killing the way he had em standing in line

Lovers call him King haters call him Clown
He would say Bite me thats the way its going down
He was having thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to Church on a Sunday and saw a deep Friar
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones was only scared of the Feds
He lived the fast life couldnt get his path right
The Friar just told him bout the Hooters that he had last night
Turn yourself in to the paddy wagon Said No
Bacon wouldnt take him had the Pigs on the payroll

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Im fearless now hear this Im earless
And Im peerless that means Im eyeless
Which means Im tearless which means my iris
Resides where my ears is which means Im blinded
But Ima find it I can feel its nearness
But Ima veer so I dont come near
Like a chicken or a deer but I remember
Im not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer I really shouldnt be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere yeah Im both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie pockets full of posies
Given to the mother of the deceased
Awake and at war til Im resting in peace

Youll sell more records if you Dumb it down

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
And Im mouthless which means Im soundless
Now as far as the hearing Ive found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear shes fine and shes flying
I feel Im flying by em cause my minds on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Whos also Klingon to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
Im flying on Pegasus youre flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder picker of the fire flowers
Spit hot fiya like Dylan on Chappelles skit
Yeah smell it on my unicorn
Dont snort the white horse but toot my own horn
Sleep

Hook 2 Graham Burris

Theyre startin to think that smart is cool Lu Dumb it down
Theyre trying to get up out the hood Lu Dumb it down
Ill tell you what you should do Dumb it down

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
And Im brainless which means Im headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplayless sex is which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklaceless like a necklace theft
And I aint used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the bestfed FF jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon Westside beside em
Chesthigh and rising almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine make it rain
You make a boat I make a plane
Then I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again

He once was a hero they dont love him no more
Theres a blast every time a ten hits the floor
Had a gift for not fighting another mans war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put someone else in his place to restore
The state the illusion that its safe
The faith that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room
And rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers he once trained
To never miss their targets heartless

Well I herd like groups of cows

Semiautomatic weapons that produce kapows

They gon hit you up you aint even gonna see it
You got a lot of money I aint tryin to be funny
But they say where you goin you aint even gonna need it
I seen you ridin round shinin with your fine round
Diamonds pretty green eyed lady
Been on the sideline plottin while you prime time poppin
Hungry niggas want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect your bakery cause they comin for your head
And theres a bounty on the chain thats hangin from your neck you see

Gon be strapped cause a nigga finna squeeze off ten
Run upon this nigga lac ratatattat

Shit is going down if ever I see him
Rub a nigga out like Oxy 10
And keep a couple of dollars up in the wallet
To pay the cops so they can never box me in

Bulletproof windows you couldnt break em with a pad lock

Verse Lupe Fiasco
Let me put you on game
Let me put you on game
Dont you know that I run this place
And Ive begun this race must I rerun this pace
Im the reason its become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
Let me put you on game
They love my darkness I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
Ive been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
Let me put you on game
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this but theyre fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
Im the one that they follow I am the one that they march with
Let me put you on game
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices crackhouses and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
Let me put you on game
Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chasers pager yo Im famous on the scene
One of the oldest most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet yall mean
Let me put you on game
I am the American dream
The rape of Africa the undying machine
The overpriced medicine the murderous regime
The tough guys front and the one behind the scenes
Let me put you on game
I am the blood of this city its gas water and electricity
Im its gym and its math and its history
The gunshots in the class
And you cant pass if youre missin G
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
Im glad your daddys gone baby hope he never comes back
I hope hes with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps
Let me put you on game
I hope you die in his trash
I cant help it all I hear when youre crying is laughs
Im sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital little baby crack addicts had
Let me put you on game
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfarereceiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor quench your thirst on my elixirs
Let me put you on game
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel so I make them cool
Let me put you on game
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleones food
If you die tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
Cause Im the gunshot

From the inner city or the Windy City

See what I got matches on the wall
Plus a crazy flow suicide watch
Im just killin time plus Im insane
In a straight jacket but its Romanelli
Im just gettin back for now its kinda poor
Want to have things couldnt afford a Pelle
So dont mind me cause I aint got a mind
I dont front hard I aint got a mind
Im just gettin mine but dont step here
Because its something buried that I didnt find
And if Im on top like a mohawk
I remember when I was so not
It was no locks man I couldnt ball
I was so bald Robocop
I was Mr Clean now Im Mr T
But a different team FF rules
Call me FI from the Westside
And Im underground pepperin you fool yeah homey

Hook 1

I know youre slummin and you feel me want to be like that
Well you cant see me thats cause everything is black
Black black black black black black black

Verse 2
And Im feelin good like a villian would
If he was doin bad kill Superman
Tied to a log pushed into a saw
Take a little dog right through the fan
And it mean man like a dictionary
Like a definition like you never listen
Not the ition endin but the deaf part
Break it in half like an intermission
Youll see then what I mean then
Or what I meant there doesnt impair
Now youre learnin it keep rehearsin it
Til its permanent like pimp hair
Got an empire Im the emperor
Like the cat were Ill be faster
Youre tryin to add syrup just to slow me down
But I blow em down like Im halfwere
Thats wolfman you got a full house
I got a full moon then I pull out
The ace up my sleeve like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips what they took now
What they put now gotta look down
And check your shoulder cause Ill be over
Like a boater you got boulders
In your loafers put your foot down
While I Ottoman or a LazEBoy
Or a handstand see I elevate

So this lights out like a lighthouse
In the daytime make it lay down
Make it go to bed make it go to sleep
Like Deebo when he was chokin Craig
Thats a headlock its what I said I got
The whole game in like shooter box
Then the Shokazuki if you dont know the movies
I ninja vanish Michael Dudikoff
I get super low I get super lost
I be super cool like a super boss
Say they super bad but they super soft
Like super chicken without the super sauce
Lets step out its a rap now
Blow your candles and your lamps out
When I pull up you can pull the plug
Cause its game over its a black out

Verse
Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm
But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling
And whats the talking without the match feeling
Thats buried living And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons southern cities with large moons
Faith healers exfemale drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt kind of salty that Im going hard
First part of a party that I throw in parts
One minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
But thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like Im throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay playing at the mans states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes Im reflectious what they cant face
My peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
The unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand Im talking wave like you saying Hey man
And not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when youre recording
Cause thats the portion thats important
When I was reporting that I was poorbut now Im more than poor
Its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drops and the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties then it relocks then it relapsed then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got like yeah

Then forge poetry like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbety
From the steel orbitings sorcerer sorcery
Coming down gorgeously just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing a waterboarding Barbie doll
A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her dont ever send her to Mally Malls
Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macaulys claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras
The fame champagne walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition missions attacking systems
But theyre not apt to listen unless its dropping on Activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more
Than soil tainting disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing and foiling others royal saintings
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh Aint nothin to it but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary nothin do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary its a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin forest
As I perform a nerve storm I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like KoolAid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration so thats OJ da Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves thats too snug to judge who was who drew blood
And Lupe look at all these toucans in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners dont fall off cliffs they run across
Anomalies by the colony flukes by the reservoir
Wildin pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youths who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buccaro roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isnt Chicano
Whos the Boss If it isnt Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi shinobi hittin Kenno in the face with all my throwin knives
Subzero guiding hiding riding in the pack as well
Sound village Leaf village wolf spirit magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filetofish ships seashepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that youve had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cubascuba couldnt take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious featherweight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot practising stillness
Real still til he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah

Its road rage without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like No way but Im a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox molding
Go ahead
Dont stop go ahead
Sitting in your car just listening to the bars
And theres traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that Im spewing out enough to calm it down
Fore you know youre out your car with your briefcase walkin round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook like being dug by Michael Douglas yeah
So dont start that walk through Echo Park
When lifes a oneonone and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan

Where the golden means so the overseer gets overseen
And the over heres are the older things
Can see the bell but dont know the rings
The rings are not sounds but circles
Wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel
Till its all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And its dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity

Verse 3
The applause and patience of the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
Thats bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
UnderChristian its unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told its the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The souls gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask then youre reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

Because music is the king of all professions

Verse 1
Best laid plan make a mess made
Damnation lets play hands sans spades
Thats without a boycott and a sitout
AfroBlack pick in with a fist out
From the Welcome Home to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time hmm
Sick sick sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls finger waves closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters old boots thats a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale two Ls and some old letters
Now he doing double life while she lead a double life
Man he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead em to the same pen
And the hunger strike in em to the same tin

Verse 2
Getting slammed from the protest no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
I need more for the Michaels
Thats a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
Its all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
Im just looking at they feet cause Im looking for the Lord
Looking in the library looking at the law
10 years deep now Im looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty cause Im bunkin with the moors
They degenerate they aint looking at the game
They just looking at the scores they be putting on my books
Cause Im looking at the stars trade a shank for some crank
Now Im looking at a war BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen snitches on PC
MM on a mission but COs got the prison
God got us all God set us free
God is the key but the guards got the doors

Verse 3
Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid wasnt gonna take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make em stay with it
Wicked swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT Team
Thats a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop the helicopteriiiing
Man he thought that hed fly away
Like a kite take flight like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing but the kite was the key
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel out of A Block
And wear gloves for the razorwired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay Thats how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When youre rehabilitated so correctly
And lets hope thats how youre living when youre set free

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow
Are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck
As the new Jim Crow Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn
Hell be captured by Maya in a rubyencrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen The new Jim Crow
The new Jim Crow the new Jim Crow Crow Crow Crow

Verse 1
They sell they souls they sell their selves
They aint twelve they old niggas old as hell
Old as jail old as cells
Sold so much salt aint no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too you living here too
You just like us til your shift get through
You could look like us you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us you should get strike too
You should get like life you should get like woo
You should get that twice You should get refused

Over your own soul so control

You can see whats CO see

Lived in a small town his whole life
Never left soundin like the hole right
Either working at the prison or its no lights
In the system working with the police
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down he tell us
With each beat down he help us
Wrong one gon knock his ass out though
Its why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound
Its why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on em these niggas might spit

With a 3000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else to come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill she done they will never love you

This condition when the world that they make him become

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
Now bring it out like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum
Tara at Sarahs wedding Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sams hairiest hand
If that sickens you you a bigot
If it doesnt well then youre wicked
Such is life odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And todays mathematics for beloved
And beasts bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

Hook Nikki Jean
How was your day
Can I make what you say what I wanna hear
Cause I want you here
The hell that we raised
To the heavens do anything for
La petite mort la petite mort

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken What is it missin Is it dry
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didnt go relaxed
And the tension from its demise
Pulled all of the flavor from the fat and made it flat
And rather lifeless well theres a place
That has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
Its rather niceless apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when hes left to his own devices well
How is your memory Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me
Or was it slippin like permission Am I trippin like field
I feel Im grippin but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life also left out the will grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth

Is it real Is it real Is it real Ha hah

Hook Nikki Jean
Howl at the day
Can I make you my prey
Cause I want you dear ooh I want you dear
The hell that we raised
To the heavens make symmetries for
Our petite mort our petite mort

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
So glad youre back
But not glad at that youre glad
Where is the glamour in collapse
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkies a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors sittin like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We shouldve been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

Hook Nikki Jean
How are your chains
Do they make you behave
Keep you over here by your overseer
Fallen from grace
Down from Heaven to memories floor
La petite mort la petite mort

Intro Lupe Fiasco
Its for the love
Cause we love you so much
Keep it real
I dont feel what you feel though
You dont feel what I feel so
It all started out

Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco
See first I had patience and a nigga had energy
But now Im weak definitely
Pedi to the pedal you finna speed
You remind me of of my Jeep
But off in the future and what its finna be
All your memories can become enemies
So lets intercede I know you in the seat
But lets get outta that before its injuries

Hook Nikki Jean  Lupe Fiasco
At first I had patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin turned to wasting my time my time my time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All around my mind my mind my mind my mind
So before we hit a wall heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches No scratches
See first they had patience

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco
But niggas start getting sick niggas start getting ill
Niggas got cold feet niggas start getting chills
Niggas start staying home cause niggas start getting bills
Building up an immunity niggas stopped getting hurt
Niggas relied on faith
Hopin niggas get healed its hopeless nigga get real
But ah get back on the pill
We in it for the feel but even winners can earn sinner

Hook Nikki Jean  Lupe Fiasco
Patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin turned to wasting your time your time your time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All inside your mind your mind your mind your mind
So before we hit a wall heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches no stratches
So before we hit a wall heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches no scratches
First we had patience

Verse 3 Lupe Fiasco
Mini bar raided in the Indy car faded
500 miles its pretty far aint it
But its a pretty car aint it
Pretty hard painted but pretty darn dangerous
But we aint get the memo
Hangin out the window they dont care no more
Tryna take this mini to a limo
Without a helmet then you can Thelma it
Louis Louise but we on the same thing
So I be James Dean
So your wreck and my wreck look like the same scene

Hook Nikki Jean  Lupe Fiasco
So before we hit a wall heartbreak and it crashes

Then bring a frown to my friend up in an alley we warned you
Background check for the chopper
The barrel breathin back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate aint back down yet
Cause they aint wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin
Some people listen
You could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher been preaching be the person
To put some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I dont stop grindin until God tell me to
I get money I aint gotta sell my soul ho who the hell is you
They say my kind aint welcome everywhere
Well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them
Its still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
Youll solve youll find that this is
Best for everyone involved all in all the Lord my witness

Verse 3 Trouble
Permit dont need permission from a doctor
I been smokin since a preteen toddler
I been servin since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause no cracker never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yeah Im just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town
More often than these bitches emotions
I got a yapper five dollars off the streets yeah Im totin
For protection more than anything though you gon test my devotion
My first amendment right they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin up but we just focusin
On other environments cause the country is taking notice
More fiends are risin Molly the new dope
And I apologize cause it was something I was promotin
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay shit thats all they see thats all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this in 09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said all their names and niggas still aint want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mac down
Felonies all in your background
Said this in 09 and still no medicare for grandma

Verse 4 Trae tha Truth
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go blocka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like Im Waka
I dont wanna see no chain I cant rocka
Heard em tell me life is a bitch cant stop her
Even if I could I tell em I wouldnt knock her
Til I get that section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like Im Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped what that water cost
Yeah Im actin like a nigga that aint never had shit
Filet mignon porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga health care insured by that guap
Doorways aint hiding me no stop
Jackers playin overseas with they yacht

Laws out lookin for me like Osama
I dont wanna do no bid Your Honor
Still waitin on my one phone call from Obama
Tell em I need the chopper they tellin me Im a felon
Im tellin em they got it wrong I beat the case in 97
And Im well acquainted with Hell but Im tryna make it to Heaven
But they dont want me to make it thats why the niggas be tellin me
If I dont get the chopper Ima probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer Im tryna be cool
If I dont get it then everybody gon fear it
Every week Im finna make em repeat it like they in school

Storm is gone now its all clear the road was long but we all here
Now go and tell I dont care 2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All yall pussy niggas hold these
Yall play tough guys but call the police
Look I dont care I dont share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When Im somewhere sittin in a lounge chair
Overseas blowin tree blowin green throwin Bs
Livin like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all nigga roll with me
To the top couldnt stop had a major deal but it wouldnt pop
Niggas hated on me but I wouldnt stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin pop
Think so slick come and get me dog
None of yall niggas fuckin with me dog
Some of yall niggas comin with me dog
None of yall niggas boots fit me dog
You think an echo was yall you need to think tactical dog
We laughin at yall while you thinking me and Lu radical naw

Strip pole in my bedroom but Ima kill my daughter if she twerk

But a real nigga cant judge that for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal fuck college missed out but no Pyrex
My Harley got low mileage and this white carpet in my project
Thirty guns in my section none of the homies got aim

Picatinny rail with a threepoint harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ay FMJs by the box nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs nigga
Shouldnt find that surprising
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby cant afford me
Healthcare there I aint worried
Healthcare there I aint worried
Excuse me as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hiphop purist
When Im spendin 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction youll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
Its why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen cant fill us Medicaid cant heal us
And the mamas cant stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video its some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried

Cause Im from the ghetto the never ghetto come
Buzz you in if the bell of my ghetto rung
And if the ghetto lose that mean a ghetto won
Thats how they do the ghetto thats how the ghetto done
They keep it they never bring the ghetto none
What make the ghetto tick make the ghetto run
What make the ghetto sick make the ghetto dumb

A place that defines your station
Remind you niggas your place is the basement

Intro
Yeah yeah
Ayo Black its time word Word its time man
Its time man Aight man begin
Yeah straight out the fuckin dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas dont make it back
I dont know how to start this shit yo now

Verse 1
Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kickin
Musician inflictin composition of pain
Im like Scarface sniffin cocaine
Holdin an M16 see with the pen Im extreme  now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes Im suited up in street clothes
Hand me a 9 and Ill defeat foes
Yall know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some EJ sittin bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the ceelo champs
Laughin at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
Gpacks get off quick forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin through the block shootin
Time to start the revolution catch a body head for Houston
Once they caught us offguard the MAC10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up told brothers Back up  the MAC spit
Lead was hittin niggas one ran I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook couldnt look
Gave another squeeze heard it click Yo my shit is stuck
Try to cock it it wouldnt shoot now Im in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw
Three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now Im jettin to the building lobby
And it was full of children probly couldnt see as high as I be
So what you sayin Its like the game aint the same
Got younger niggas pullin the triggers bringin fame to their name
And claim some corners crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight stickup kids they run up on us
45s and gauges MACs in fact
Same niggas will catch you backtoback
Snatchin your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block gettin niggas knocked
So hold your stash til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
And if its good shell bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin and their wives basin
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleepcause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence life is defined
I think of crime when Im in a New York state of mind

Chorus
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Verse 2
Be havin dreams that Im a gangsta
Drinkin Mots holdin TECs
Makin sure the cash came correct then I stepped
Investments in stocks sewin up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin gunfights with megacops
But just a nigga walkin with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
Give me a Smith  Wesson I have niggas undressin
Thinkin of cash flow buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated Im a hijack Delta
In the PJs my blend tape plays bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black Im livin where the nights is jetblack
The fiends fight to get crack
I just max I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life rings flooded with stones holmes
I got so many rhymes I dont think Im too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me blamin us were held like hostages
Its only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
Ive taken rappers to a new plateau
Through rap slow my rhymin is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps full of villains and creeps
Thats where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
Im a addict for sneakers
20s of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleepcause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothings equivalent to the New York state of mind

Chorus
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Intro AZ  Nas
Ayo whats up whats up
Lets keep it real son count this money
You know what Im sayin Yeah yeah
Ayo put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what Im sayin
Cause we spendin these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey you know how that go
Im sayin thats what this is all about right
Clothes bankrolls and hoes
You know what Im sayin
Yo then what man what

Verse 1 AZ
Visualizin the realism of life in actuality
Fuck whos the baddest a persons status depends on salary
And my mentality is moneyorientated
Im destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin mustve got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin
Others such as myself are tryin to carry on tradition
Keepin this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin thievin
Well be leavin with some kind of dough
So until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin plenty papers
Keepin it real packin steel gettin high
Cause lifes a bitch and then you die

Chorus AZ
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we get high
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we puff lye
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we get high
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we puff lye

Verse 2 Nas
I woke up early on my born day Im 20 its a blessin
The essence of adolescence leaves my body now Im fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some godlylike thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one cuss while I pus from
My skull cause its pain in my brain vein money maintain
Dont go against the grain simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now its all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin years in the hundreds
I switched my motto instead of sayin Fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle couldve struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4matic to crack your whole cabbage

Chorus AZ
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we get high
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we puff lye
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we get high
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die thats why we puff lye
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die

I sip the Dom P watchin Gandhi til Im charged then
Writin in my book of rhymes all the words past the margin
Behold the mic Im throbbin mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thiefs theme play me at night they wont act right
The fiend of hiphop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation react like Im facin
Time like Pappy Mason with pens Im embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I cant call it the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin but never fallin six feet deep
Im out for presidents to represent me Say what

Dwellin in the Rotten Apple you get tackled
Or caught by the devils lasso shit is a hassle
Theres no days for broke days
We sell it smoke pays while all the old folks pray
To Jess soakin their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin a word best describin my life to name my daughter
My strength my son the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction all the wrong shit I did

Verse 3 Nas
Im the young city bandit hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps I kick my thoughts alone get remanded
Born alone die alone no crew to keep my crown or throne
Im deep by sound alone caved inside 1000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while its over me its too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin to maintain I flip fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps not eatin can make my heartbeat skip
And Im amped up they locked the champ up
Even my brains in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin Big Willie style
Check the chiptoothed smile plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes burnin dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop checkin dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

Intro
Right Right
Check me out yall
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Verse 1
Before a blunt I take out my fronts
Then I start to front matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldnt catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
Thats like Malcolm X catchin the Jungle Fever
King poetic too much flavor Im major
Atlanta aint Braver Ill pull a number like a pager
Cause Im an ace when I face the bass
40side is the place that is givin me grace
Now wait another dose and you might be dead
And Im a Nikehead I wear chains that excite the feds
And aint a damn thing gonna change Im a performer strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas why did you do it
You know you got the madphat fluid when you rhyme
Its halftime

Chorus
Right Its halftime
Right Ayo its halftime
Right Its halftime
Right Yeah its about halftime
This is how it feel check it out how it feel

Verse 2
Its like that you know its like that
I got it hemmed now you never get the mic back
When I attack there aint a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause Im as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
Im max like cassettes I flex like sex
In your stereo sets Nasll catch wreck
I used to hustle now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels wear jewels hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mothers stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause Im wise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in 83 I was an MC sparkin
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps cause I thought niggas wouldnt understand
And now in every jam Im the fuckin man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch CHiPs now I load Glock clips
I got to have it I miss Mr Magic
Versatile my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual Im an intellectual
Of rap Im a professional and thats no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man you cant near it understand
Cause in the streets Im wellknown like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas aint all that
And next time I rhyme I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggas say Im wild
I hate a rhymebiters rhyme
Stay tuned I assume the real rap comes at halftime

Chorus
Right Its halftime
Right Exhale check it its halftime
Right Its halftime
Right Its real in the field
Word life check it

Verse 3
I got it goin on even flip a morning song
Every afternoon I kick half the tune
And in the darkness Im heartless like when the NARCs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb thats my word
I be slayin them fast doin this that and the third
But chill pass the Andre and lets slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Puttin hits on 50
Cause when its my time to go I wait for God with the 44
And biters cant come near
And yo go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I wont plant seeds dont need an extra mouth I cant feed
Thats extra Phillie change more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and
The Boogie Down enough props enough clout
Ill Will rest in peace yo Im out

Verse 1
I rap for listeners bluntheads fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessyholders and oldschool niggas then I be dissin a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor fuck whos the liveer
My man put the battery in my back a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My durations infinite moneywise or physiology
Poetry thats a part of me retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hiphop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco bluntsll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
Its real grew up in trife life the times of white lines
The high pipes murderous night times
And knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac hold strap
With my peeps thats into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler
I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dicerollin mats for craps to ceelo
With sidebets I roll a deuce nothin below
Peace God Peace God  now the shit is explained
Im takin niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
Its like that yall

Chorus
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge

Verse 2
One for the money two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Aliz niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine God check the prognosis is it real or showbiz
My window faces shootouts drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses only the drama
For real a nickelplate is my fate my medicine is the ganja
Heres my basis my razor embraces many faces
Youre telephone blown black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro dramatic automatic 44 I let blow
And back down popo when Im vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brains blank
I see dark streets hustlin brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin for somethin somell prosper some fail
Judges hangin niggas uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin cross with nails
Ill reinforce the frail with lyrics thats real
Word to Christ a disciple of streets trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat that niggas name made bell rings black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo son heard he was kingpin
Yo fuck rap is real Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Chorus
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge

But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin on the Island but now in Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corners ours
On the reals all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill see you on the next VI
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent you flicks

Verse 3
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Minds in another world thinkin
How can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books bibles et cetera
Fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexeder
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin Ls while Im sleepin
A twoday stay you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin terrible
Fuckin with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home nobodys out but Shorty DooWop
Rollin two phillies together in the Bridge we call em oowops
He said Nas niggas caught me bustin off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tredeuce
He inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack my army suit was black
We was chillin on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin mad shit
I had to school him told him dont let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows
The one thats murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck families fucked up
Coulda caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed
Shortys laugh was coldblooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve tryin to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose wipin the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man Ima ghost I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake Shorty Wop one love

Straight up shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble gunsll blast niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot full of mad criminals
Who dont care guzzling beers we all stare
At the outoftowners
Ay yo yo who that they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers
Homicide chasing brothers
The Ds on the roof tryin to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it cant happen til I trap em and clap em
And leave em done wont even run about gods
I dont believe in none of that shit your facts are backwards

Whos always on the corner rolling up blessed

Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor keep it under my tongue
The school dropout never liked the shit from day one
Cause life aint shit but stress fake niggas and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer crew desizer accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Ballys and Cazals with black frames
Now Im into fat chains sex and TECs

No doubt see my stacks are fat this is what its about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning see my crew on the block
Every days a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasnt hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory breaking the locks
Nowadays I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard God let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun son but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then Ima be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too with Swoop
Bokeem my brother Jungle Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mikell chop it Mayo you count the profit

Produced by Large Professor

Verse 1
It aint hard to tell I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death breathin a snipers breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a cometinvasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian halfman halfamazin
Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin then extend strong
I drink Mot with Medusa give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale it aint hard to tell

Verse 2
The buddha monks in your trunk turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up parties I shoot up
Nas I analyze drop a jewel inhale from the L
School a fool well you feel it like Braille
It aint hard to tell I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills Im Ill plus Matic
I freak beats slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me surprise me but cant magmatize me
Scannin while youre plannin ways to sabotage me
I leave em froze like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well it aint hard to tell

Verse 3
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
Ill leave your brain stimulated niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang begin like a violin
End like Leviathan its deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops givin mics menestrual cycles
Streets disciple I rock beats thats mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
Youre still a soldier Im like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetrys deep I never fell
Nas raps should be locked in a cell it aint hard to tell

Intro
Uhh yknow
I still run with that that blood of a slave boilin in my veins
Its just hot  until a nigga cant take it no more
Blood of a slave heart of a King  turn my voice up

Verse
Ayo the brothers Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave wipin the dirt cleanin my shirt
They thought Id make another Illmatic
But its always forward Im movin
Never backwards stupid heres another classic
Cnotes is fallin from the sky by now the credits roll
Theyre starrin Nas executive poet produced directed by
The Kid slash Escobar narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin to survive
The feature opens with this young black child fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa turnin the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls 45s playin soft in the background
Food from CTowns mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends walkin out the door all of us poor
I learned the difference tween the snitches
The real ones and whos soft and the murderous hungriest crews
People jumpin from roofs
Shotguns pumpin made it through my youth
Walkin very thin lines ages seven and nine
Thats the age I was on my album cover this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin through the hot desert searchin to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning  nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places its like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all did it all most of yall will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the gamell get rid of yall
Yall got there but yall didnt get it all I want my style back
Hate to cease yall plan its the rap repo man
To them double up hustlers bidders niggas who real
Professional stickup kids dreamin for mills
Let my words guide you get inside you
From Crip to Pirus this is survival

Outro
Blood of a slave heart of a King
Blood of a slave heart of a King

Verse 1
Brace yourself for the main event yall impatiently waitin
Its like an AIDS test whats the results Not positive
Whos the best Pac Nas and BIG Aint no best
East West North South flossed out greedy
I embrace yall with napalm
Blows up no guts left chestface gone
How could Nas be garbage Semiautos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome come out of my throne
I got this locked since 91 I am the truest
Name a rapper that I aint influenced
Gave yall chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame kept my name in his music

Chorus
I Fuck with your soul like ether
Will Teach you  the king  you know you

With your hands out for my money man how much can I take
When these streets keep callin heard it when I was sleep
That this GayZ and CockaFella Records wanted beef
Started cockin up my weapon slowly loadin up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint dick
First Biggies your man then you got the nerve to say
That you better than BIG
Dicksuckin lips why dont you let the late great veteran live

Interlude 2

Gods son across the belly

The king is back where my crown at

I Fuck with your soul like ether
Will Teach you  the king  you know you
Not Gods Son across the belly

Verse 3
Yall niggas deal with emotions like bitches
Whats sad is I love you cause youre my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child Ive watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin women
Were you abused as a child
Scared to smile They called you ugly
Well life is harsh hug me dont reject me
Or make records to disrespect me blatant or indirectly
In 88 you was gettin chased through your building
Callin my crib and I aint even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin in my face glad to break bread with the God
Wearin Jaz chains no TECs no cash no cars
No jail bars Jigga no pies no case
Just Hawaiian shirts hangin with little Chase
You a fan a phony a fake a pussy a Stan
I still whip yo ass you 36 in a karate class
You TaeBo ho tryna work it out you tryna get brolic
Ask me if Im tryna kick knowledge
Nah Im tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether that shit that make your soul burn slow

Oh I get it you Biggie and hes Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS that was the end of his chapter
And thats the guy yall chose to name your company after

In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock fellas
Foxy got you hot cause you kept your face in her puss

To take it back to Africa I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle

Verse 1
Zoom from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin they gums do he be clappin and shootin guys
Actor or a movie star rapper revolutionized
What is his race nation or creed
Is he Arabic Black Latin Asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water talked to the heavens
Spit at judges stepped on peasants
But in reality I just entered your galaxy
September 73 up in these wild streets
Fuckin these wild freaks a harem of hoes God damn
And my mystique got em tearin my clothes

My nigga smoke with one lung

Only way you die if its meant to be

No discussion is the principle we bust and its the end of you
Now we knockin on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink my kind of war
Death angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin for you whos gon win
The hands of time or the hands of medicine
Dont cry witness your fate this is your wake
Walk by your casket spit in your face
Enter the fog dog the light is your guide
And when youre gone all your niggas gon light it with Nas

Verse 3
Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now

Do it like this niggas right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now lets say it all together let the ceremony start
I shall  stay real stay true stay holdin figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear
I swear thats how we pledge allegiance to the alliance
Of underworlds killers and thugs though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green and pass it around pass it around

Chorus
Now tell me what yall smokin

Verse 1
Uh uh yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas  too real Nas  true king
Its however you feel go head you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I dont kill soloists only kill squads
Fame went to they head so now its Fuck Nas
Yesterday you begged for a deal today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since  Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit its funny I once said
If I ever make a record I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock asleep
I never asked to be top of raps elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

Chorus Sugar Man sample
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man

Verse 2
Now wait a sec give me time to explain women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal high smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old my flesh rot away
But thatll be the day when its peace
When my gat dont need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for Gods help why they love hurting me
Im your disciple a thug certainly
Im the N the A to the SIR
If I wasnt I mustve been Escobar
45 in my waist staring at my reflection
In the mirror sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a kings throne my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis this is what I changed to
And God Im so thankful

Chorus Sugar Man sample
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man

Verse
Listen up gangstas and honies with your hair done
Pull up a chair hon and put it in the air son
Dog whatever they call you God just listen
I spit a story backwards it starts at the endin
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one screamin shoot dont please
I put my fifth back on my hip its like a VCR rewindin a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin reverse slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin crazy like go he there
Sittin in back of this chair we hittin the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin records backwards of ACDC
I give my niggas dap jump out the van back first
Back upstairs took off the black shirt
Im in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so yall can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like outside right we
So with my mouth wide holdin my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze plenty for you
Cause Jungle said block your on enemys the
Hung up the phone then the phone rang
Im laid in the bed thinkin about this pretty young thing
Who left she came back her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her no hell she talkin about me kiss
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin with no hands a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me stressed really Im
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin through the door she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And thats about the time the story begun
Thats when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said Son we found that nigga we gotta kill

Outro
Beep
Ayo son ayo son you hear me you hear me
Listen man this dude right on the block
Right now man I found him right now

Verse 1
All I need is one mic
One beat one stage one nigga front
My face on the front page only if I
Had one gun one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did pure
Like a cup of virgin blood mixed with
151 one sipll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips plottin shit
Mad violence who Im gon body This hood politics
Acknowledge it leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us siren roll up and try knockin us
One knee I ducked could it be my time is up
But my luck I got up the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin between the spots that Im hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back  fuck gettin hit more sirens
This is my hood Ima rep to the death of it
Til everybody come home little niggas is grown
Hoodrats dont abortion your womb we need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stickup kids with no conscience leavin victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is bout nigga the time is now

Chorus
Yo all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
Thats all I need
All I need is one mic
All I need niggas
All I need is one mic
Yeah

Verse 2
All I need is
One blunt one page and one pen one prayer
Tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact maybe more than one look back
At all the hatred against me  fuck all of them
Jesus died at age 33 theres 33 shots
From twin Glocks theres 16 apiece thats 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin 17
27 hit your crew six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime hope your funeral
Never gets shot up bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin is fair niggas roll up shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin tastin revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years too many times
Now Im strapped with a couple of MACs too many 9s
If yall niggas really with me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
Theres nothin in our way they bust we bust they rush
We rush lead flyin feel it I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war lie em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now

Chorus
All I need is one mic
Thats all I need niggas thats all I need
All I need is one mic
Theres nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic
Thats all a nigga need to do his thing yknow
All I need is one mic
This is all I need

Verse 3
All I need is one life one try one breath Im one man
What I stand for speaks for itself they dont understand dont wanna see me on top too egotistical
Talkin all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is niggasll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns Im blastin cause Im a cool nigga
Thought I wouldnt have that ass done Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl eternal souls clashin
War gets deep some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars brothers knifin each other up in
Prison yards drama where does it start
You know the block was ill as a youngster every night it was like a
Copll get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler purchased my Range niggas throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished shoulda knew she wasnt
True she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin I never make the same mistakes movin with a
Change of pace lighter load see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin police how can a kingpin squeal
This is crazy Im on the right track Im finally found
You need some soulsearchin the time is now

Chorus
All I need is one mic
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic
Thats all I ever needed in this world fuck cash
All I need is one mic
Fuck the cars the jewelry
All I need is one mic
To spread my voice to the whole world baby uh

Verse 1
Yo explode my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude I mastered this Rubiks Cube
Godzilla fought Gargantua eyes glued to the tube
Was a long time ago John Boy Ice
Geronimo police jumpin out Chryslers ez wider paper
Pops puffin his cess punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes killers
Saw Divine Goon and Chongo Lil Turkey
RIP Tyrone member no cursin front of Ms Vercey
Big Percy Crazy Paul the Sledge Sisters
My building was 4016 once in the blue hallways was clean
I knew all that Id seen had meant somethin
Learned early to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin carefree laughin got jokes on the daily
Yall actin like some old folks yall dont hear me
Yo Im in my second childhood

Verse 2
Yo dude is 31 livin in his moms crib
Exconvict was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair still slingin got a crew
They break his moms furniture watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin Ls
In the same spot he stood since eightyfive well
When his stash slow he be crazy
Say he by his moms hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers different blocks different years
Sittin on different benches like its musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life hes on the corners at night
With young dudes its them he wanna be like
Its sad but its fun to him right He never grew up
31 and cant give his youth up hes in his second childhood

Baby girl shes always talkin name droppin hangin late
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy craves shoppin
E poppin Ecstasy takin wont finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin stuck with limitations
Lustin men many hotels Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he dont get that love he deserve
He the Sun she the Earth single mom even worse
No job never stay workin mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person
Never matures all her friends married doin well
Shes in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twentyseven argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess shes in her second childhood

Intro
This is a journey
Into the worlds most largest and notorious projects
Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers

Verse 1
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin some stories
First theres this arrogant fuck his names Cory
Hung around my mans Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevors still locked up Lakes gettin his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh whatever
Cornchip Buckwheat lookalike its Mega
Right Mega was his name sorry about that
But its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
Always actin tough a jokester be frontin
He got snuffed he got shot in the thigh he did nothin
But thats Nas always lookin out for bredren
Cause when bredren dont return love it dont stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit real recognize real
Still laughin to the bank and shit
Back to Cor got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes Im always on his mind
Nonsense not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch you from around the way its sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge we gotta have unity

Refrain
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it

Verse 2
Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies
Theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigys my dog
Through the ups and downs robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what nigga Youre butt and it got back to me
Askin a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You aint from my hood dont even rep QB
Nature moved to Marcy
Man dick riding Nature nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy far far away
Backward ass niggas man fuck them niggas
Go head with the program man proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher car thief
Of course we aint friends you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies ghouls and gangstas
Cops drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich its just not
No more morals no loyalty no more community
Queensbridge we gotta have unity

Refrain
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but its these cowards that kill it
So they say

Verse 3
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan

Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin up house my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P how many times aint you shamed that
Jungle was bustin his gun to get your weak chain back
They dont respect you a cheques due for me for your fame

All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

Refrain
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah this is the time we destroy and rebuild it
They say the bridge is over the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but its these cowards that kill it
So they say

Nah never that nah yo yo

Verse 1 Nas
I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest every day is a chal
I would think Im a part of USA and be proud
Confronted with racism started to feel foreign
Like the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission never know whats next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe every continent
Yo theres Asia Africa Europe France Japan
Pakistan America Afghanstan
Yo theres Protestants Jews Blacks Arabics
Call a truce world peace stop actin like savages
No war we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time its been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon why then
Must it go on we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die we all Gods children

Chorus Nas and Amerie
All this hate cant last forever uh cmon
Its time that we stand together yeah for the world
Everybody wants to rule the world what what what what what cmon
World peace world peace world peace world

Verse 2 Nas
Yo theres brothers on the block posted up like they own it
Thats they corner from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like dog you safe whenever you with me see this is my town
So the youngsters grows in ghettos goes to prison
At an early age already know its against him
So in order for him to survive one day he must open up his eyes
To the set backs and rise
Cause everybody wants a shot in this land of opportunity
Look at what this countrys got
There shouldnt be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he aint fixed home yet
The earth wasnt made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds to home it belongs
I want land mansions banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa oil in my control
The worlds natural resources all its residuals
But then comes foes I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service
I guess attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel yo

Chorus Nas and Amerie
All this hate cant last forever uh cmon
Its time that we stand together yeah for the world
Everybody wants to rule the world what what what what what cmon
World peace world peace world peace world

Verse 3 Nas
Yall know thats my style to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love be a chain in cause
You alive right now
Theres so many thats dead or locked up inside the beast Im a hot light now
Its whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up cause time reveals
All this hate cant forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven its like you right here and never passed
You just transcend I know Im gon see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Aint nothing without struggle listen up its critical
We used to fear arms now the weapons are chemical
In HipHop the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid and unless
Poppin any rappers head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me so fly you cant near me
You scared of a mirror my theory is that  knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner we gotta get ours now

All this hate cant last forever uh cmon
Its time that we stand together yeah for the world
Everybody wants to rule the world what what what what what cmon

Yo niggas aint forget shit know what Im saying

Niggas aint gon forget that you know what I mean
Yo what this war just show me is like

Verse 1 Nas
Ayo its packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devils lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do a fuckin killa
Mothers a dopefiend embarrassin me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery cant remember him was probably 3
Why didnt my folks just die in this society
Why wasnt I a child of a doctor who left stocks for me
Two little brothers two sisters them shorties gots to eat
Mothers a junkie she twisted so all they got is me
Im the provider with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold or holdin revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin me high
It comes to me slowly the words he would cry

Chorus Nas
My country shitted on me My country
She wants to get rid of me Naw never

Verse 2 Millennium Thug
It is I that step up
Me that dont give a fuck you that foe then its all over soldier
Hummers and Ranges through the desert
Fuck a 20inch long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin for manslaughter
I gotta get back for what they owe
Shootem in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag hold tie gag
Forget the life had now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
Im a mad man this is a real life movie Mad Max
SKs AKs max ABRs spittin and it aint a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin I come back but yo

Verse 3 Nas Millennium Thug
Yo Im sittin behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin on a visit God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo its some for rape
Some brothers innocent I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo Im wishin I was in your shoes
Holdin machine guns
Clean fun shootin dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
Its Americas plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo Im startin to think its all a scheme nobody cares
I know the warden is readin the scribe
But yo I swear its a billion dollar business
Courts lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system Im bout to rebel

Verse 4 Millennium Thug
Theres not a bitch in sight
Or block bench or black gate
Or gray fence look who fucked it all up Mr President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin bent
Now its state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here his head came apart
What a bloody mess a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine at night I hear grown men cryin
You know Im spittin mine
I aint goin out here we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
Im checkin my chest holdin my head
Catchin my breath watchin my back
Smokin this grass beatin my dick thinkin of ass
I dont know what they broadcast the newsflash is fake
Everyday Im feelin like you I wanna escape
And if yall niggas feelin like me yall niggas just say

Chorus Nas
My country shitted on me My country
She wants to get rid of me Naw never
Cause the things I seen We know too much

Ayo its poison ecstasy coke you say its love it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin shot given poison

Verse 1 Nas
In hospitals shots riddle the block little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin mind what is this the hundredth time
Sendin flowers to funerals readin Rest In Peace
You know the usual death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these blackkiller companies is makin money off us
Fast food Cola soda Skull and Bone crosses  its all poison

Chorus 2 Nas
Ecstasy coke you say its love it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good given choices

Verse 2 Nas
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin hopin that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless
Thinkin a perm or bleachin cream will make them better when theyre gorgeous
White girls tannin liposuction
Fake titties are implanted fake lips thats life destruction
Lightskinned women biracial
Hateful toward themselves denyin even their blood
I dont judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison thats even worser than drugs

Chorus 3 Nas
Yo its poison ecstasy coke you say its love it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants with the poison

And any thoughts of takin me down is poison
Who want beef now My heat shall anoint em PLAOW

Interlude Nas
Never to worry all the wrongdoers got it coming back to em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em
Everybody reaps what they sews thats how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse but well get through it yall be strong

Verse 3 Nas
The Chinamen built the railroad the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed em
They call it Thanksgiving I call your holiday hellday

Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last
Im with my heckles connectin and we hittin the lab
This is my level fuck if it get you mad

Chorus 4 Nas
Its all poison all of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about kis its all poison

Verse 4 Nas
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey lightskinned with herpes
Fuckin sisters in Harlem Brooklyn and DC
This is the problem cause he never tell em he got it

Drives a Benz hangs at all the parties
All the concerts backstage where the stars be
Rockin they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
Whats your name Where you from
Chain blingin thinkin girls everywhere is dumb
Takin pride in ruinin their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom give him head He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate believin in karma
Those on top could just break and wont be eatin tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin on a niggas dreams
They leave when that nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin dudes thats neglectin their seeds
Instead of takin care of em theyre spendin money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies
Cause when them kids get grown
Its too late for you now you old and you gettin shitted on
Its all scientific mystic you know the Earth and the stars
Dont hesitate to say you heard it from Nas

Verse 1 Nas
Uhh yeah uhh
Blessings of life to the children they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me this old niggas words couldnt be realer
Im on top now slightest drama Ill have ta kill ya
Cause animals sense weakness sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material havin no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive cop a new five
Circle the block where the beefs at
And park in front of my enemys eyes
They see that its war we life stealers hollowtip lead busters
Theres no heaven or hell  dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God your mind keeps lurkin the earth
Watchin your own murder reoccur

Chorus Blitz
For ever struggle every strip and every ghetto
For every nigga totin inner pain and heavy metal
For every child thats born and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle every strip and every ghetto
For every nigga totin inner pain and heavy metal
For every child thats born and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning

Verse 2 Blitz
Its Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked refused 3 to 9s went to trial for me
Basically Im just reality loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt no street is exempt
Extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin pictures of my pain illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind in these fatal times
Vest crimes nickelplated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry still Im sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin high to relieve the pain breathin in the game
Exhalin guilt sin and shame misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring luck or anthrax
I stand back hopin Ill make it through tomorrow

Verse 3 Nas
My skin is a art gallery right  with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin kids freeze in winters they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzs and feel no remorse
Drivin past them in the lively fashion diamond colors clashin
Red stones blue stones red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when Im with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her its lessons
Black princess its a ugly world
I put my life up for yours see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadows jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
Im lonely
Hold me its gettin darker

Chorus Blitz
For ever struggle every strip and every ghetto
For every nigga totin inner pain and heavy metal
For every child thats born and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning
For ever struggle every strip and every ghetto
For every nigga totin inner pain and heavy metal
For every child thats born and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another morning

Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon be the first nigga we attack
Dont want that but it comes though most of the time when you dont know
Stickin together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon stick up for
Each other like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors
We aint Club Nouveau

Verse 1 Big Boi
Many a day has passed the night has gone by

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said Baby boy you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past your assll be a haswhat
Thats one to live by or either thats one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure
Andr got to her station heres my destination
She got off the bus the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group aint comin with it
But Im witchya cause you probably goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin but examine all the flawskywawsky
Awfully sad and its costly but thats all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shits creek Its weak is the last quote
That I want to hear when Im goin down when alls said and done
And we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down
All yall can say is Them niggas earned that crown but until then

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes y
Nothin is for sure nothin is for certain nothin lasts forever
But until they close the curtain yall know its him and I Aquemini

Verse 1 Big Boi
Now is the time to get on like Spike Lee said Get on the Bus
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin its a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch Familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman how in the fuck do you think we gon do that man
Ridin round Old National on 18s without no gat man
Im strapped man and ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times and swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you aint got no rims nigga dont get no wood grain steering wheel
For real you can go on chill out and still build let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill pay your fuckin beeper bill bitch

Chorus Andr 3000
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die

But until they close the curtain its him and I Aquemini

Verse 2 Andr 3000
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
And lived happily ever after but thats another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby ballers and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling what you bought so cut that big talk
Lets walk to the bridge meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
Its them poor babies walkin slowly to the candy lady
Its lookin bad need some hope like the words maybe if or probably
More than a hobby when my turntables get wobbly they dont fall
Im sorry yall I often drift Im talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Dont want to be it but its needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause
Is every nigga with golds for the fall Naw
So dont get caught up in appearance
Its OutKasts Aquemini another black experience

Chorus Andr 3000
Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes y
Nothin is for sure nothin is for certain nothin lasts forever
But until they close the curtain its him and I aquemini

Verse 3 Big Boi
The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know dat some say we problack but we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks you bust rhyme we bust back
Getget back for real niggas thats out here tryin to spit facts
You hear dat You cant come near dat maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin shit like this

Verse 4 Andr 3000
My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twinAndr Ben welcome to the lions den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make itthats the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again cause I swear I spot one every now and then
Its happening again wish I could tell you when
Andr this is Andr yall are just gon have to make amends

Chorus Andr 3000

Ten dollar dreams scheme for a sack of that believe that
Im wit whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin my cocaine raw
Drop sixtytwo off the brick jump back
Twenty over now thats mo money to get
Slick we fin to lick on this corner without gettin caught
But time keep a sleepin and money gettin short
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin fuck him
That why he ride through the hole with the do swangin
But I make moves shake them tricks up out they shoestrings
Be more precise when we do things
Cause life is like shakin the dice but I buck back twice

Shit cops and robbers niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin you aint knowin how much money you spent

Who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin everybody smokin em out
When you was broke though they was missin
Now you ridin bout fo deep startin to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support my fault forget to mention
You dont even have a checking account wasnt thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak N Ale Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope its payin the bills so you gon do it
But legislation got this new policy three strikes and youre ruined
Now where your crew at Yeah

We better watch what we doing and look out for Joe Nab
And quit reing up and standing on this same old block

But still aint did nothin that aint been done befo
You cant be trying to showcase just put it down for your spot

So I think when I finish selling my last sack
Ima take some of this money go and give some back
Cause people wont forget about the time you gave knowmsayin

Yeah Im back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme about where my roots at
Yeah Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah GA is in the house so check it

Verse 1 Big Boi
February 1st 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack now hes gots responsibilities
Stayed at me grannys while me mammy was at work
And she couldnt watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home down in the Westside projects
Changin over foodstamps and hittin a lick was next see
Im just a playa like that my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white tshirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin or floatin a Brougham is what Im sportin
Sade is in my tape deck Im moving in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets thats where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts lickin leaves rolling reefer papers
Im slightly slouched in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave and the hoes they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the fiends follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
Its everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go head on with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because Im true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars you shit out of luck
Because the Westside aint taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Hook Sleepy Brown
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch

Verse 2 Big Boi
See niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years so these niggas aint gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangols so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your moneys spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as theres that tic tic followed by that bump
Im down to stick a ho if she got a Gstring
Cause the niggas in the Point aint changed main
You might call us country but wes only Southern
And I dont give a fuck PFunk spot to spark another

Hook Sleepy Brown
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch

Verse 1 Big Boi
Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew
Lets say her name was Suzy Skrewcause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player Im dickin the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her slayed the bitch like Darth Vader made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada her wig was sharp and sporty that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
Its foggy I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven oclock its gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall wearing a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck I wanted to sex the ho up
She said Lets hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck
I said Cool I really wanted to cut you but thisll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too
She said she understood and everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil Will CD and a fuckin poster its like that now

Hook Sleepy Brown  Big Boi
Its like that now you better go on
And get the hump up out your back now
Its about four or five cats off in my Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
Its like that now its like that now

Verse 2 Andr 3000
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said What you wanna be She said Alive
It made me think for a minute then looked in her eyes
I coulda died time went on I got grown
Rhyme got strong mind got blown
I came back home to find lil Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

Verse 1 Andr 3000
Baby did you hear that Yeah baby I heard it too
Look out the window golly the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals havent a clue as to what the funk is going on
Im on the telephone dialing the Dungeon Hello
This Dre bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby grab the baby cause baby it aint much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and thats a sign
Omega nigga IFOs are landing in Decatur
Hope Im not over your head but if so you will catch on later
Played the track guess she could not take it anymo
Raping her heavenly body like a ho coochie so
From niggas constantly fucking her never loving her
Never showing appreciation busting nuts in her face when they done

Who said good folks is not supposed to die

Verse 2 Big Boi
The sky is falling nobody balling they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs but the Hornets they won
Nigga we slum kept all the guns I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew theyd try to ram me
But Im stabbing making my way on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky east west no clouds
Him coming now fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay Yeah yeah she chillin
We should be at The Dungeon shortly aint nobody on they porch see
Approaching the final exit Im thinking I see four horsies
But I dont though nigga you wont know until its on ya
I put that on my dope boys from ATown to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know theyre smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

Niggas laugh but my expression wasnt hardly the same
Show me respect cause its due you keep the fear

Verse 2 Andr 3000
Yo now you and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat feel like a trachea oh dummy
The pain thats in your chest done made its way
Down to your tummy you wide open you start smokin wit ya girl
She nigga bashin sayin you dont need em in your world
Niggas all dogs If niggas all dogs then what you call broads
Felines in heat meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin
Oh now its really crunk cause yall silly drunk
And your girl done got to thinkin
She talkin bout Girl you look so beautiful
You say thank you bein nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice But shes back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get
Dont let her have her way with you shes gonna have a fit
Youre the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Heres what you do  you
Grab her by her neck throw her on the wall
Say Bitch dont ever disrespect me never not at all
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Then black ball laws of balance at all cost

Verse 3 WitchDoctor
Que pasa que pasa Check this out
Quiet nights like this might twist one for the mota
On the balcony I got a sofa
Nights like this is perfect for this Spanish Fly
Can you come over somethin I wanna show ya
Told ya once we was gon take a trip touch you
With my lips where you like it its time dont fight it
Piggyback ride to the sofa in the microwave
I got your favorite Stouffers lasagna thats how much
I want ya fuck flowers
The ceremony starts from the shower with the water
I got somebodys daughter in the Doctor headquarters chillin
Prepare for this sex drillin she said somethin in Spanish
Got me feelin mannish me and you fin ta vanish
Real quick feel this shit got cheese tryin to make cheese
To get you pregnant overseas
Maybe make sho thats my seed
Quiet nights like this bachelor like me is single
Talkin to you Miss Bilingual
Lets mingle in the crowd watch them show pop some Moet
Tryin to get you so wet never been to Spain
Never been a lame horny ever since I been a tiny
Fuckin with niggas with ageless bodies
Talkin to me while I squeeze it bare
Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair

Bout fo niggas and fo hoes it aint gon be nobody losin
But they choosin
Better get in where you fit in cause its crucial
Im tryin to cut bout two of them girls

From the front to the back this cognac got my throat burnin like burlap
Everybody cheesin knowin these hoes gon cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew

The easiest was the meanest but the skeezer was a beanie
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies
So I checked her like the king I am no disrespect intended
Told her and her silly friends

You know the club dont close til four
Lets party til we cant no more

Verse 2 Andr 3000
As the plot thickens
It gives me the dickens reminiscent of Charles
A lil discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville USA
Via Atlanta Georgia
Alil spot where young men and young women go to experience they first lil taste of the night life
Me Well Ive never been there
Well perhaps once but I was so engulfed in the Olde E I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine bowlegged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with Set it Off in the right
But it all blends perfectly if you let the liquor tell it
Hey hey look baby they playin our song
And the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality its only about 3 AM
And three niggas just don got hauled
Off in the ambulance sliced up
Two niggas don start bustin wham wham
And one nigga done took his shirt off talkin bout
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court
Its just my interpretation of the situation

Verse 3 Big Boi
Yes when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes ya dig
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you  somebodys daughter
Raisin yall own youngn now thats a beautiful thang
Thats if youre on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations that is
Cant gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service  the people at the Post Office
Didnt call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute

Verse 1 TMo
Piece by piece this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho go head and dont be scared
Many a bitch represents and is led
Whichever way no Im not gay
And really dont give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs to feed takin what we need
To succeed you know what we gon do on this road
We gon explode now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth long as breath is in my body
I got proof Im not scared

If you scared say you scared

Verse 2 Gipp
Whos scared
In this world Im Gipp in second the mutant
The third the Geechee how many ways can you reach me
Now most be scully went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine the season to rhyme
Been down like brown like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high while others were duds
Live high up on the hills to escape the floods
Situation they change like faces and names
Went from cool to plain from lame to flame
Man down or not man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think we aint movin out this spot
And Im out

If you scared say you scared

Verse 3 Andr 3000
Yo paragraph indent I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope hint hint
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint
Now hes twentyone and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey whats the haps Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap
Baboon on your back but whats sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyones undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you cant hide it
Maybe your son tried it rehab too crowded
You scared she scared they scared I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it

If you scared say you scared

Verse 4 Big Boi
February 1st 1975s my birthdate
The player the BOI was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave you betta believe I tote that shank
So what yall thought bruh
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums this one feel like the beginning
The intro the Goodie we kinfolk nigga its fin to jump off
But now its time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon cut off
Psych the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart dont pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone like Marilyn Manson you cant hush me
Yeah

Verse 5 Khujo
Heatll make anything move
Even Tyson can get laid down with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind dont give me mine
I go off like mines blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings and die like fuckin men
I dont care how rough you roll we cant be shut down
Aint no openin up shop we already established
You lap doggin we boss hoggin
Grown men dont beg for attention
Keep wishin high heels clickin
Paper champions leavin with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin at twelve
On the bottom bunk holla at me
Six to the left last one cant turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead devils dont have enough to purchase my essence
In da head missin ounces zip code eight miles
Suckas think I got they package
But they still eatin moomoo oinkoink
And fowlfowlfowlfowl repeats

The truth hurts but you cant be scared of it
So remember that OutKast Goodie MoB
Still standin for somethin while yall fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our powers in numbers
You can deny the lie but you cant deny the truth
You scared you scared say you scared

Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars make a million mo
First class broad treat you like a nigga po
You wanna say Wait but youre scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and its moving fast
Tryin to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds then you go on home

Verse 5 Big Rube
I must admit they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain from the host of cocaine
From them whores from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
Theyre from the Glock rounds and lockdowns and burials
The seeds that sow get devoured by the same locusts
Cause its a hard row to ho
If your ass dont move and the rain dont fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong so some survive
So youre surprised now Im bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride fool I dont wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted without infanticide
Its like that red sprite you cant imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid twofold on technicalities
Clickin your heels scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe though
I dont think we in Kansas no mo though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldnt be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening

Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South the ATLiens aint changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga thats from the ATown see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality fallacy butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for yall Im looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows bwoi
The nigga the BIG like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks cause yall niggas jokes like the Joker
Im sick of these wack ass rappers like Im tired of hoes in chokers

Challenged Andre to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low I guess you wilding

Dont you love the way we claiming Bankhead stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb thats never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop

Verse 4 Andre 3000
Yeah tight like nuts and bolts sluts and hoes they get evicted
Im dealing wit Queens in my castle aint worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like Im they way up out the projects
Cant put you on my payroll and no I aint got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying Well rap for food
My face is bawled up cause I aint in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the windex
Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax
Error bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle

Oh hell there he go again talking that shit
Bend corners like I was a curve I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard its not where youre from but where you pay rent
Then I heard its not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows amongst other things but Im not worried
Cause when we step up in the party like a mouse you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr Pickles

Or will it feel that if we tune it it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone

Honey Im home but Im not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now Im sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team and like your daddys wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens so back the hell up off me

Verse 4 Andre 3000
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The worlds a stage and everybodys got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so Im ready for war okay

Verse 3 Big Boi
Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like ES to the PN cause we adjust to the beat in the zone zone
Honey Im home but Im not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now Im sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team and like your daddys wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens so back the hell up off me

Verse 4 Andre 3000
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The worlds a stage and everybodys got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so Im ready for war okay

Verse 1 Andre 3000
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian
Want a description My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there cant be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that man fuck them niggas Im going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems thinking its better for em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it had it alked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy wanna pretend
Like you Ms Goody FourShoes even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chillun
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
Im willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my seorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now its real Jazzy Belle

Verse 2 Big Boi
See what if you was a playa real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life lobster steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes life as you conceived it
But your conception deception looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and its depressing
Theyre digging up in your thighs leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bailbonds
Steadily calling me Antwan cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch dont play me cause youre janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame anigga dont even know yo name
Its a shame you cracking em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
Im leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake dont get me
See I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause youll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber yeah you know what Im saying

Verse 3 Andre 3000
See me and ol girl in the blackonblack Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps sticking together like grandma and grandpapa
In this dogeatdog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school now they dyking

Verse 4 Big Boi
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds dumb
Deaf and fine they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be I know shes sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
Cause they burning anyway Big Boi use her and abuse her

One for the money yes sir two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go round tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs this shit here must stop
Like Freeze We making the crowd move
But we not making no Gs and thats a nono

Verse 2 Big Boi
Check it a onetwo a onetwo dope niggas in the Cadillac

Chunky asses passes getting thrown like Hail Marys

Some nigga was saying something talking bout smoke something Hey man you remember me from school No not really
But he kept smiling like a clown facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me What kinda car you drive
I know you paid I know yall got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that yall done made
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True Ive got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week

Remember the football socks aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs now

I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so lets crank up a session
Like TriCities High School was pulling em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey choking off da peewee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you nathaniel but swolled up
Hootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell em Big Boi did it I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl when you giving up them drawers cause

Poof back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high

While the rest of the country bungies off bridges
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me
Cant even get no back rub these days
Aint that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now thats hard

Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me freaky you
Cant help but be aroused
Scuse me Lord lustful thinking
But thats the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods
And laid with the squirrels
During PE wed be
Exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on
Until we felt excited then aaaah
Oh now its on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere

And Ill see you on the next song

Cause thats like backboards without the rims

Like the niggas who owned the liquor store
Crack cocaine pimps and whores

Before a nigga like daddy was born

Scared looking up in your face boy I see dead

Enemies in the Ps freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with wouldnt I
Wouldnt I be the wrong one to try
Never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo
Flows on like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street

Never baking rebuking Satan
We had you waiting
For the Second Coming funny how time flies when youre rhyming

Compose wont yall get sick of that cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that aint hiphop
You find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then Im happy

Cause Im gon dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later
Cause we might need you in this war Im wailing on you traitors

Words of a change I dont feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Aint thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it til I get with
Adapt and overcome oh hum hum
Go get my gun load up for fun and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from MLK to Cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes now its quarter kis stacking Gs
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings and fed time to writing rhymes
It aint just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it cant happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes its just a dream

Be rhyming catch of the day when the recipe calls for blackened
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and its enticing how them Joness sing
So Im gonna sing just like them to get where they at
Ill even break my by back to touch their rim if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever thats looking tasty water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit wont call no names cause thats not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
But if you dont you never will you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel

Luck only counts in rabbits feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you dont mind me eating off of yours
Process smmmoking like Jerry
Meanwhile fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test the potency
Why laying here they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
I wish I never did what I did now face this bid
It was the company you kept the many places you slept
When you shouldnt have geeking like a rat jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
Got you niggas where they want you again

To dicks oh six serving them in the mix but aint no mystery
You know the history about this clique bitch
Oh what you want me to call you slut
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS Im afraid thats why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut every month thinking Ill let that fire roll
Like chimneys and smoke signals maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream home team banging them with these hits
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

About that pimp shit that walk with dat limp shit that hemp shit
Looking up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy who didnt come to court
On a Tuesday April Fools Day dont get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninetysix
Buying another Fleetwood Diamond took it so know wes in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
Cause them niggas at the corner sto been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways high days are better than sober ones
Dont be biased but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know Im babysittin
Yall dont know nothin bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dipping
It aint over why that why that til the bitch open her mouth up
And sang

Verse 3 Big Gipp
Took me a long time to get here

Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you dont educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade let my hair drag
Back and forth like a seesaw
Jumping Lily to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
Im broke in like some old men
Whod stop dem or would stop
Im dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
Its ninetysix Im in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream

It wont be over til that big girl from Decatur sang

I had the best of life in my clenches but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending dont even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times I think Im crazy then I say forget it
Or maybe its the devil infiltrating and like RiddickBowe

Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential levelwhat are we doing
Fooling ourselves clowning ourselves playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We cant babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we cant get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture thats painted
Tainted as the mind whos blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mindnumbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and dont look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon

Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see theyre making their paper so I guess I cant complain
Or can I I feel theyre disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving aint tasting right
My stomach cant digest it even when I bless it
Im confessing one more lesson from the South we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go head and diss it while real hophippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts

Hook Debra Killings
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

Verse 2 Big Boi
Uhh born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
Its the nigga the BIG be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
Im thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew thinking theyre robbing you you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems Im reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Dont expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust us we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin niggas dippin

Hook Debra Killings
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

Verse 3 Andr 3000
Our dearly beloved we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we aint gon stop until we hit the big screen
Psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
So we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

Verse 4 Big Boi
Like some eagles people dont understand
Just like their parents dont be caring
Im speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it get it but you aint pimping no bitches
Cause you flauging falling like leaves into driveways
Isnt it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old

Hook Debra Killings
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

Outro Andr 3000
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old

Im pretty sure the verse get pissed enough to miss the bus refers to the Montgomery bus boycotts in the 50s considering that Outkast is a southern group

I say stand up on deception of time all of Revelations
And recognize this mind on the reality of horror
Known as mankind

This line is mostly wrong I contacted Big Rube years ago and surprisingly enough he responded back thanks MySpace If I remember correctly the correct lyric is

I say stand upon this section of time marked by Revelations
And recognize this mind numbing reality of horror known as Mankind

Its wrong all over the internet which is why I asked him directly Hope this helps

The closing track to OutKasts classic sophomore release ATLiens features a great spoken word verse by Big Rube before the duo begins to ponder their future

Verse One Andre
One for the money yes uhh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin
Off instrumentals had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot known that we could rock
Doin the hole in the wall clubs this shit here must stop
Like freeze we makin the crowd move but we not makin no Gs
And thats a no no

Verse Two Big Boi
Yeah uhh check it
Ahh one two ahh one two doe niggas
In the Cadillac they call us went from Players Ball to ballers
Puttin the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggas say motherfuck that playin they payin
We stay in layin vocals locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry Outkast yea dem niggas they makin big noise
Over a million sold to this day niggas they take it lightly
Ninetysix gon be that year that all yall playa haters can bite me
around this bitch

Chorus repeat 2X
Me and you your momma and your cousin too
Rollin down the strip on vogues
Comin up slammin Cadillac doors

Verse Three Big Boi
Back in the day when I was younger hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rallys bullshit pull shit
Off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was stoned like white boys
Smokin them white golds before them blunts got krunk chunky asses
Passes gettin thrown like Hail Marys and they lookin like Halle Berry
So so fine intertwined but we aint sippin wine
Wes just chillin Im the rabid villain and Im so high
Smokin freely me Lil B Greet Mon and Shug
And my little brother James thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at them rats know mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick and mama Im suckin dick now
We movin on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eightytwo
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

Chorus

Verse Four Andre
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
That I just came from some nigga was sayin somethin
Talkin bout Hey man you remember me from school smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
Facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me what kind of car you drive I know you paid
I know yall got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that yall done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you dont move yo feet then I dont eat so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia this aint gon stop so we just gonna continue

To whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper but Im tangled in my cord hum
Bored kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so Im running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
The damsels in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor and that Im a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin warmer
They only getting colder hell maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament to see who can be me
Better than me its a permanent smile on my face
Because you said you dont like my style
But thats OK but just make sure you dont touch that dial
And well be cool touch it and yous a fool
Look Ill get you hooked yall crooks might even move
To Atlanta Georgia get a wife and daughter
Start a new life and all that wrong you do youll make it right

Congratulations Im a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal criminal minded nigga so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo ass its bout to tear
Intended for anyone filling out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
Im firing on the spot go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle Ive been patiently waitin
Now thats a virtue cause pussy nigga Ill hurt you
Like the presidents approval rating by servin yo ass with words fool
Slam yo back to the curb bruh a sanitation worker
Cause youre trash Im taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because its no longer valid
Go head recycle repackage then put it back in my cabinet
Boy thats germs Im fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the BIG go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around Im right after Martin Luther
No JR period senior cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biologicals intact
Talk bad about the fam catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact not fiction Rumpelstiltskin you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Dont go against me Caine I want you to go out there
Kill them marks and come back is you with me

God only knows what Ive gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

Verse 1 Big Boi
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger couple of kids in minivans
Standin in the stands like a fan watch her little man
Run ball And everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the hide the spouse in the house
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
Motherfucker shit gotdamn asshole

That didnt do his part heartbroke or no more marriage
When it happens youll be slappin yourself rememberin
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin was splendid see she was grinnin and spendin
All of her time wit the kids an in the kitchen shed cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin I had paperwork on the misses but I didnt

A ho gon be a ho and it dont matter about you stressin
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection

Lord be havin mercy on my soul
Im havin the impression that my life gon be a bowl
Of cherries but its very hard for me to cope
Got tired of bein broke
This ATLien aint got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while yall made up yall beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975 never thought Id make it this far
Still battlin in this racial war
Tryin to find solutions to the situation Im facin
Only thing thats free is my flow that yall be chasin
Lettin my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like droppin books lets stop the crooks from robbin you
Of your brains and such usin welfare as a crutch
Im in it for good you into my hood you wont be findin much
Hope that when Im gone yall remember this
What we stood for fuck that fame and that glitz
Its beginnin to look a lot like the endin
And got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin
Revelations gettin impatient and now Im dead
Remember what I said Im gone bow ya heads

Verse 1
Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
Twan aint always in a vibe for spitting I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasnt ready to be no father maybe kinda sorta
Cause when I saw her I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here yall
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog
Back in 94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck they aint tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine now lets deliver to the masses

Hook Sleepy Brown
Its been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye goodbye goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly I fly I fly so high

Verse 2
Welcome to my life I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens we was killing it
And then my auntie passed she was like my mother I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
Its your birthday even on your worst day
Live it like the first day Im Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I I be on that kryptonite that means I cant be hurt

Gotta leave this place its been cool but I got to go

Hook Sleepy Brown
Its been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye goodbye goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly I fly I fly so high

Bridge
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
Ill be back again
Know we been though a lot and I aint perfect
But I swear to you Im a changed man
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
Ill be back again
From the caboose

Verse 3
And now its time to say goodbye they shouldve turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
Im a family type of person but Im deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
When your faith is in the right place see he aint gon let you flop
You can say whatever you want Bet you cant do it like me Boy stop

Bridge
Before you say you cant hit goal
Please no excuse this time dont be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
Its time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place its been cool but I gotta go
I can take it from here ladies yall done a good deed tonight

Hook Sleepy Brown
Its been a good long road

Verse 1
Nnnnot too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeontoed
But things have changed it aint so simple
Now life is a musical

I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said hey hold up fore we put out another song
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Cause aint nothin changed its simple
Hey lets make a musical

Hollywood Divorce

Featuring Snoop Dogg  Lil Wayne
Produced by Andr 3000
Album Idlewild
    
Hook Andr 3000
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce

Verse 1 Lil Wayne
And Im a star
Yea and I dont have to go to Hollywood
Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think theyre stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day wed take it back like Hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
What would you write if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you dont even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python I meant Cobra
Im so not sober Im high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda you can call me a roller
Hold up your grills glistenin
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
Whats the real sense of it
Bling bling I know and did you know
Im the creator of the term I just straightened the perm
Aint let it sit too long they just makin it burn
And make a movie of our lifestyle but they earn
Like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece
Thats why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I bes the little nigga cooler than antifreeze
Defrost on your window pane  Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood its Little Wayne dont make me none
So thats why I got a prenup
I do

Hook Andr 3000
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce

Verse 2 Andr 3000
Yeah Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I dont
If she aint got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve I dont be on no curb
She aint no junkie neither I aint no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap she aint know how to act
Now that Ive got your undivided attention Im
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon stack promise me you gon ball
Promise me youll invest three fourths of it all
For what So your kids kids kids can have some cheese
Cant get with it Get get get get get on your knees
Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Dont like what I write Shoot me a bird

Verse 3 Big Boi
Starts off
Tenth grade the way was pave for me and Dre to create
Like Dr Frankenstein the arts and crafts
Now could we make a difference
Antwan Patton and Andr Benjamin
Been jammin for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
Thats quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think its dismissed
Part two the sequel all new Kast
Just aint the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
Theyre lame and their life is pretty plain
MMs with no nuts
Wont show up facetoface straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a casebycase basis like the judge
What about these lyin ass hoes tryin to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
Nigga please
But even she can walk well miss her we aint gon fake it
But God dont make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

Hook Andr 3000
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce

Verse 4 Snoop Dogg
I do love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights camera action its game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife
To love her and cherish her for all your life
I solemnly swear to dare share take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
Its been a long time we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence  is that right
But you love the Dogg gave me the spotlight
And now Im growin up showin up blowin up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me need me dress me
Now its so messy straight cut out and left me

Outro Andr 3000  Snoop Dogg
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues rock jazz rap
Not even talkin about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood its over
But its cool
We just keep it goin and make new shit
Take our game take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb thats a cold thang

Verse 1 Janelle Mone
Welcome to my world oceans vs mountains

Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
call her the poor girl cause she loves to fight them
Im quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See Id like to fall in love but
Not that type of guy
Oohwee you got my clouds on fire
Were tight rope walking and the worlds the wire
Remember kissin on Broadway you die
I was bein your baby and tickin your tock and yo clock
See we done jumped the broom and now you know Im goodpending
And I was dreamin bout children Emily and
Oh darling baby with the daddys eyes
And it meant so much to me it meant so much to me
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
I needed you you know
But when the love is gone its time to go

Chrous Janelle Mone
If you dont think I mean it
Then youll feel it when Im gone
I said Im done enough of your love
I said Im done enough of your love
Im up til 3 oclock in the morning
While you party up til the dawning
I said Im done enough of your love
I said Im done enough of your love
Darlin aint no feelin left its just the killin
Oh just grab my gun and lets go out
Just grab my gun and lets go out
It aint no room for love its just this burnin
Got me reelin
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

Big Boi
Oh baby its mo baby its workin on the 6
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like boohoo then boo fuck you and fuck you too
Fuckin bitch
Kids cover them ears
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus yo plate
But wait now Dont you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours now its all yours
Thats hard Its all yours Good God

Chrous Janelle Mone
If you dont think I mean it

Constricted by the muthafuckin boundaries an ounce of weed
Or a pound of dro couldnt place you on the planet where Im transmitting
Life from Bro Bra bruh Brother Broham
Cadillac on vogues strike a pose then the door slam
Wham nigga wham Dont they say that in their show dad

Like everything is alright clearly tight to def
I can see clearly now analyzing every step step
Clearly you can feel me cause its beating through yo chest chest
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip but wet
With no tint not deject clearly Im a vet
And not no veterinarian but clearly pit bulls are the best are the best are the best
Like the OUTKAS clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you actin like ya dont then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
Cause the ticket is a oneway clearly back we wont be coming

Verse 1 Big Boi
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out or even pull your fucking heater
To make his whole crew believers youre harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that dont be sounding like King Shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just aint good
Just being a hustler serving the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month so Im hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto yo
But thats aight though cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take theres a dollar to be made
Im digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep there it is now its time to smoke that dime

Chorus Big Boi
If you smoke a dime then Ill smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime then Ill smoke a dime

Verse 2 Andr 3000
Time is slipping slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they dont know me
Come and listen to my story I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the booboo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick Im in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall Im having a ball making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter Paul and plus that Mary Jane
Im rolling reefer out of a Regal how could I refrain
From being rough from being tough from being dangerous
Im hanging with the PA nigga aint no changing us
See you can try if you try if you dont you dont
If you wanna battle its either that you will or you wont
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas dont comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that right you bite you fucked up
You wont be getting away this time Im real as hell so whats up
I rip shit wit pimp shit Im slanging it from the South
Talk bad about the Atown Ill bust you in your fucking mouth

Nowhere to duck bullets fly niggas die
By getting blasted how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw I take that back thats my problem
Turning and walking away
This aint gon work when they be robbing
As long as Big Bois still living never standing by my lonesome
Step up nigga if you want some

Chorus
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
Wes having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
Its just a pimps players Mack daddies East Point
Its all about that cess in yo chest Its the joint
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
Wes having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
Its just a pimps players Mack daddies East Point
Its all about that cess in yo chest Its the joint

Verse 2 Big Boi
Well nigga you softer than silicone used to pump up tits
Its that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
Im quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope but in 1994
Im making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect cause wes gon be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah it was so hard to say goodbye Im a man now
Im at the end of my street so its time to take my stand now
I call the wild because its time to take the streets
So if you aint got the vertebrae or big enough nuts retreat
Im ready to wet em up like cereal
Just an international playa coming through your stereo

Chorus
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
Wes having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
Its just a pimps players Mack daddies East Point
Its all about that cess in yo chest Its the joint
Aint no thang but a chicken wang

Off my street but in my hoodhood they hollering ghetto
Dont got no neighbors they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Aint shit that we can do but rest in peace pour a brew
On the concrete remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy
They know not to test us test me do me try me
Tripping with that drama my Berettas right beside me
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Yall ask me what the fuck Im doing Im releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger Im taking it one day
At a time I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre Ill take it to the HoJo bitch
Just to let you know yeah

Chorus

Verse 4 Big Boi

And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun

Load it clip up after clip Im packing my gauge if I feel it
The Glock the gat the nine the heaters
See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you
You posed to be the quickest draw but man I hail em faster

Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips Ill send you to an early grave
You fucking slave you better try another way
To take me out is truly something difficult
Dont even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
Im out of bullets letting loose my last clip
Ima kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah thats how I do
You know thats how I do you know thats how I do

Interlude
Hierrr this is the Captain  speaking
We are now descending into Hartsfield International Airport
Id like to welcome you to Atlanta
We have clear blue skies over Atlanta
Which by the way is the home of the Atlanta Hawks the Braves and the Falcons
To the far left you can see the Georgia Dome
Which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag

Atlanta has been called the new Motown of the South
And is the home of LaFace Records
Organized Noize Productions

If you look to your far right you can see Decatur
And below you to the right is East Point and College Park
Home of the red dogs rap cats and robbin crew
And home to the player the Lacs and the motherfuckin Outkast

Big Boi 
    
Verse 1 Big Boi
Well its the MIcrooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please aint nothing but incense in my atmosphere
Im bending corners in my Lac boi
Cause thats how we be rolling here
Deep the slang is in effect because its Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo heaters cause you sposed to cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now Im just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid cause it aint nothing to see

Verse 2 Andre 3000
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No my heart dont pump no KoolAid
Jump and youll get too sprayed
Who raise yo block The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting swiftly
They aint gon get me got something fo em
The devil up in yo grill and you still dont even know em
Show em whos the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes I got soul
Thats something that you aint got
Thats why your style is rot
ten stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell swollen got my pockets business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that its that

Hook Choir
Its that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you dont abuse it
We gonna get cha high high

Verse 3 Andre 3000
Time to drop these bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ho
And knock em up off they feet like a Southern hustler supposed To do Is in the house like a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
Im packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue its funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

Verse 4 Big Boi
Well okey dokey Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville can you handle that you rat
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge PUMP
You want to do a jack I heat the barrel til its empty get me
See I aint Finlay getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but dont try gaffling me
Cause sleeping youll get served with some Southern hospitality

Verse 5 Big Boi
Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day be rolling like that today hoe
So back up off it get up on it if you want it yall
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Players Ball yup
So now I step rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Verse 6 Andre 3000
Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue the sun is beaming its seeming

Verse 1 Andr 3000
Ill be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Yall cant stoop to my level Im like the devil or whatever
Im picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I aint bragging folks dragging me up and down the road
Theyll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet come Dasher come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns I think that is the answer
But the question Should we take that bullshit from them people
Im making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Aint no sequel no saga no way out Im nervous
Ive had it up to fohead of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger and Im wishing and I wonder
Damn will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said Im half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart we back on the saddle
No longer yall know yall had us down for some years
Its the call of da wild nigga uh there it is

Hook CeeLo Green
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me x4

Verse 2 TMo
As I step up the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect so I get respect
Dont call me T its a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo mane
Smoking that dang dang making mics swang
In my 280 Z nobody can see me cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn Id probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam

Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You cant hang with this see aint no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because Im dangerous
I breaks em off like I was Beat Street see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking break on out or get your life taken boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut your wig split
Simply means Im bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how Im kicking it
Coming around the ghetto victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it Ill still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit thats simply how I run my shit and thats how it be
That nigga BIG BOI that be me yeek
See Im a playa got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like rightyeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So dont flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG original gangsta not quite
But maybe when Im locked up lifting weights getting swole right
Lifes a bitch with a Gstring its either in your ass or it aint
So you can see who can really hang
But yall dont wanna do nothing yall can go to hell
Aint no playas in office cause Im locked off in a cell
So can you feel me nigga

Hook

Verse 4 Khujo
Khujo coming in dope bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro dont come round me with your flim flam hot damn
Its a jack top of the burbs and my notebook is a bird
Ks madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot desire in your pot is something wicked
But you cant feel it stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past now its time to blast that ass
Shhh Mr Knighton take off your hat
Cant even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping oh my peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions decisions to make oops here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits
This is your brain on drugs this is your brain
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest its gettin horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl yahhh
I let out a call to da wild

Verse 1 Big Boi
Well it is I the pimp playing nigga that you heard about
Yeah I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
Ive been a player since the age of two
Thats when I learned to walk grab my crotch talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp thats what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets thats where I growed up
And make my money cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it Im on my own Im in my zone
And nothing wrong you dont belong you left me standing alone
Yeah Im the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins shit I got all that
But you aint know Im the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite Dolemite not shit I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head greasy face eating watermelon
To drug dealer armed robber now convicted felon

Hook  Big Boi
I wonder how you would be actin if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt thats how I payed my dues
Uh 123 thats how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas thats in back of me

Verse 2 Andr 3000
Oh heavenly Father why do you even bother watching over me
Growing up a little G my mama thought Id grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This aint no secret garden so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own Im letting the trigger be
Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when niggas slanging quarter keys
Just trying to make it then of age come through take it
I aint forgot about yall women who be working Nikkis butt naked
At Magic City shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I aint got no sense thats what I got them thinking
I think about Barack strap myself and keep on danking
Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path Ill leave you draining like a fountain
Yes its been like that since way back in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

You need to git up git out cut that bullshit out

Well uh get up stand up so whats said you dickhead

My mama made me do it but the devil he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddys brothers I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemarys baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell I treat em all like hoes see I pimped em
Bitch never had my money so I never whipped em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa aint a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up git out git something

Throw me over in the fire let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutants mind
Im getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
Its eight in the morning and aint nobody up yet
I got my long johns get my coat and throw on my ball cap
Im headed out the door to get off in my ride
Im digging through the ashtray hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaicas best and when I light it up I hear a voice in my head
You got to git up git out and git something
Now I know its on my day is finally started
Back up in my crib eat my shit break out quick in my slick
84 Sedan DeVille steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs Im busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area Im scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops fuck Elgin Bell

Yall telling me that I need to get out and vote huh why

I got to register I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta ay
Yall could not tell me nothing thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13 start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips over to East Point still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school Id rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class Id rather be up in some ass
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rollypollies
Damn thats fucked up I shouldve listened when my mama told me
That if you play now you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with

Big Rube
Operating under the crooked American system too long
OutKast pronounced outcast
Adjective meaning homeless or unaccepted in society
But lets look deeper than that
Are you an OutKast
If you understand and feel the basic principles and
Fundamental truths contained within this music you probably are
If you think its all about pimpin hoes and slamming Cadillac dos
You probably a cracker or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just dont understand
An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes his hair
His occupation his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself are you an OutKast I know I am
As a matter of fact fuck being anything else
Its only so much time left in this crazy world
Wake up niggas and realize whats going on around you
Poisoning of the food and water
Tampering of cigarettes
Disease engineering control over your life
Take back your existence or die like a punk
This is Big Rube sayin right on to the real and death to the fakers
Peace out

Intro
Greetings earthlings Take me to your leader ooh shit

Hook
DEEP you want to go DEEP Ill take ya DEEP
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
You let me hit the stage thats when I got my folks hooked like

Verse 1 Andr 3000
Deeper than deep dish hammers and vogues
Deeper than thee fish in the Ocean
I got my gun on standby like Coast Guards
You boast hard youll get your salty ass crumbled like erb word hey man
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I aint the one with the curse so disperse yes catching plagues
Niggas catching AIDS niggas getting sprayed niggas on they way
To a dead end you wont catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I dont eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8 but now I shove it down your throat
Quote If they kill they own folks what you think they gonna do to you
Im Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your muthafucking spine
No I make that three cause I dont wanna hear you whine

So you know that its DEEP

Hook

Verse 2 Big Boi
Well you want me to get DEEP well then I will

So if you pulling a tool nigga you better use it
Cause if youre threatening my life better believe Ill be a fool with it
I dont take no shit from nobody
I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn no pain no gain so Imma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up you get done up Imma end it
Throw the gun up out the window see the corner that I bent it
Its just so simple how we get so DEEP
Learn a lesson pick up the album when it hits the streets like

Hook

Verse 3 Andr 3000
No I aint never been pimped by the system
Thats because I aint no slave
Dont be trying to sunbathe never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Yall think Im stupid cause I shoots em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball Ill show you how to shoot it
My heads polluted cause Im zooted bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordans came out yall figure that I got em
But no I dont because I dont be having funds
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Yall could not be just like me if yall was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off Im in that ass like interior
Oh step in my Cadillac lets ride through the hood
Eh why dont you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
Thats living on a whim thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor can I gets a little backup
Please dont let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we equal

Gonna take yall deep so go back

Hook

Verse 4 Big Boi

And I dont give a damn muthafucka cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through I shall never call you master
You DEVIL the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain its beginning to smell like dog yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
Youd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp flip the script if you can get with this
They call me Big Boi I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it then you bite the big one yeah

How to be the smooth operator dominator
In the state of Georgia hip hop standard destroyer
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer
He from the dirty now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldnt object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth this
Planets standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
Youve obtained you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff locked up no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears and my peers
I hear the end is near no fear we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like

Verse 1  Big Boi
First rule in this thang never let em see you sweat
Never let em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect em as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm out of dangers way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you wont find it for sale
Unless youre in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldnt abort that case
Nobody to take your place family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run

Verse 2
Once upon a rhyme one time when I was a child
Flip that smile upside down now
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny
Didnt have many but had enough to get by enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dads relationship
Take a trip you bring potato chips Ill bring the hot sauce

Verse 3
1979 Dirty South local lounge
Flip that smile upside down now
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic language mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
Ive grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the game plan cause we got that hot sauce

Ok I start out all alone
Cause my baby mama left me
Now theres nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms Jackson done got cloned
Well its some real shit and Im living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter my baby my baby mama all escaping me
In the wind she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you cant win

Hook x4
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Verse Two
Round two a single parent what is Big to do
Throw a parrty Not hardly Im trying to stay up outta that womb
Or that puss uss I said uss
Luther Vandross couldnt make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed pushed to the limit Smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was suffering the house was feeling wicked
The cat got sold the dog got old the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most part you fuss fight fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds grown folks blind to the sign

Hook x4
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Verse 3
KO knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter dont want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son he cant talk when I change him hes peeing
I think hes pissed I cant dismiss the matter of the fact
Because he saw you and me argue now the energy is coming back
Set an example a positive pattern keep life on track
But Im married to the music and committed to the wax tapes and CDs

Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care

Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thunder no wonder it cant be smothered
Or buttered up buttercup melt your sauce
You a Chuck E Cheese bouncer chumpin off the boss

And Im sick as a cough did I mention its raw

And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars

Thats makin me spill my guts chill Big lay in the cut
For what I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nuttin all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel

And chalked it up basically America you got FUCKED

Operation Anaconda  ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders did they ever find Osama
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice
See AlAmin got life and Fred got dead Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom
As we read together as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things wont be no better
But it got to you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves airwaves energized and SHOCKED you

Verse One Big Boi
Big slide into the mode time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen I
Dont think that I can get out this hold
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I cant move I cant eat I cant even breathe
Cant even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees no Ps to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning
Butwhat about repentance
What about detention
What about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen
What about repentance
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah

Hook  singers
Why are we here Huh Huh Huh
Please tell me  what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr
OW

Verse Two Big Boi
Life is nothing but a dream so peaceful and serene
Unless youre being evil then you on the devils team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon youll have to sew those bad seeds
Please any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that Im merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying
What about repentance
What about detention
What about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen
What about repentance
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah

Hook Sleepy Brown
Sometimes life can keep you down with your face all in the dirt

Verse 3 Big Gipp
They call me Mr Ravioli Mr Streudel
Mr Poke Em with the Noodle Mr Cockerspaniel in your Poodle
After school tutor Roto Rooter addicted to follies

Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian

Talk to me now 84 hard 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies they want to walk wit me now talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch hit her in the eye for me now

Verse 5 Ludacris
Ludacris yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile crankin the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx

They dont believe that well stab them in the abdomen
From College Park Georgia to College Park Maryland
So put your fist up boy you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline yes ladies and gentleman
Denenen A hundred thou bitch Diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro reaching for The Strap Below
Or with some nasty hoes eating pistachios
Yall driving Subarus stuck in your cubicles
Im stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Hook

Verse 6 Big Boi
Fourth and goal should I take the three point field goal
For the score or should I roll around and take the ball
Up the middle the gut the what the hole
Cranium overload overthrowed now we got seven more
Points on the board fa sho
BIG BOI me oh my I think Hes blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu its in there giving you some of the best of me
Playa pimp gangsta poet we gon spit it we gon show it to yo ass
Youre a champion were my dads last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say Big Boi can you pull it off without your nigga Dre

Verse 1 Big Boi
Well heres a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situations ugly like In Living Colors Wanda
Word up
Now everybody play dumb but theres some that succumb
Or fall victim I will overcome
Any hurdle or obstacle thats in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last
For the risk you took trick you shook your ass
For some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now thats ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot you got that phat purse
Pocketbook stop and look pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life
Your dignity the only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebodys wife

Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda now shes out of a job
She would slob on a knob for a little less than a yard
A massage you could drill her like a sarge
She would charge and rob pick through your pockets
She got the tricks watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the nightstand fuckin with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously there was a knock on the sliding glass door Bitch its me
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped now Im getting in your shit

Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block
Didnt have to break a steerin column didnt have to cook a rock
A damn goodie twoshoes that what they call ya
Never judge a person or a book by its covers
Just because my tone is darker than yours a little tanner
You never took the time out examine yourself boi
 are you black white Asian
Indonesian or Borean thats black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathin
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seein
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that PA sticker on it cause they scared we gon curse
But the knowledge is the power the cowards get devoured
Any hour any cipher any way to any height
Because I might just snap on a fuckass nigga
Might clap a cap at a suckaass nigga
In the meantime Daddy Fat Sax gon chill out
He might just pull out his pistol
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kent you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus Jason my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Aint no uno we a duo deuce dos to a pair
A player stiffen the competition

If you brunette Legally Blonde I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake and beyond
Antwan raps on raps on clap off clap on
I switch the flow so quick you cannot fathom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good but you sound like shit
And your team lookin shitty to death

Verse 3 Killer Mike
My nigga Big Boi said watch em as they gawk and they gander
You can follow or lead like Commander Picard
You can have The Whole World
Or be satisfied with the boulevard overstand
This young players rhyme
I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine and Im
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mineAqueminis

You know what I take that back why You was alive
Date of conception interception cause the sperm did collide
From T n A to DNA feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didnt put a halt to our very existance
We livin breathin soon well be teethin
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages

I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus
Of them crackers but Ephesians 612
Said it wasnt flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness
In high places so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang but my name aint Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle

Thats beyond bright this day will be done right
There is a war just waiting on the other side of the door
But Ill be bringing God to the gunfight
Cant live forever so have some fun right
Lifes a bowl of candy you can have one right
You can handle if tomorrow never come right
Youll get used to singin if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldnt have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playin Go Fish but not below this
Before I go I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse perhaps youll consider resetting

Verse 4 Andre 3000
Got a sweet lil darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her but act like I dont want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how Im feeling Id holla that its irrela
I dont get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record have you ever rode a horse
Like for you to send me to Pluto I said Of course
But if you aint a sweety indeedy I wont endorse
Han Solo til Im hit by the bullet so may the force be with you
And Ill hit you when better time permits
For now show me samples examples why youre the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that Im in
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend

Verse
I met you in a club in Atlanta Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like Yeah nigga right
But you gave me your number anyway
You were on the talcum
Powderhows about them oranges
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day studied the history of music
By night just to pay for that shit youd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impossible
We were both the same age but I
Suppose wasnt on the same page but in
The same book of life so Id page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when youre on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head Im thinking cool
Just when I think Im going down your shirt
Youre hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
Youd dropped me off by the Dungeon
Never came in but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling crack sack by sacks so they could function
WWWWell yes and no
Yes we were selling it but no it wasnt blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled ho
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear you know what Im saying
But I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve 7 digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But when I got home I never did
By the time I did heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied see you later
When he got the good news thats life shit
Now Im 19 with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque but Im living with my poppop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more follow me
Are you starting to gather what Im getting at
Now if Im losing you tell me then Ill double back
But keep in mind at the time keep it real was the phrase
Silly once said now but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona and Freakniks
Made you wanna drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South but that aint a Kodak
Moment on went myself and Big Boi
Well you knew him as Twan
Thats right you were around before this shit begun
When Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drove it back with some Yak
Girls used to say Yall talk funny yall from the islands
And Id laugh and theyd just keep smiling
No Im from Atlanta baby he from Savannah maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down hey we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes
Shes playing tennis disturbing the tenants
15love fit like glove
Description is like 15 doves in a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose agree
Enough about me hows about you Hows the lil kid
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadnt smoked or took a shot of drink
Cause Id start the second album off on another note
Now that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see Id balled out and fore I fall out
Id slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise yeast was the street
To make bread never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
Id meet Muslims gangstas bitches rastas and macaroni niggas imposters
So on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching but I started liking this girl
Now you know her as Erykah On and On Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone Why you
Do that girl like that boy You ought to be ashamed
The song wasnt about me and that aint my name
Were young in love in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion had a son
By the name of Seven and hes 5
By the time I do this mix hell probably be 6
You do the arithmetic me do the language arts
Yall stand against the wall blindfolded we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Mama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because shes smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit thats been sitting in his yard
You fix it up you trick it out you give it rims you give it bump
You give it all your time because thats all you can think about
And thats as far as I got
music fades

Radio Interview
And thats as far as I got and where I wanted to go
Knowing the whole summer thats all you could think about
Even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up
You need a jump like your need and your want to grow
And you change all the time
So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer
The next summer you didnt want that Rabbit no more
You wanted something bigger and better
So the summer passed and now the Rabbits old
Right right so now you want a Cadillac

Verse 1 Andre 3000
All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playing married or paying child support

I love your mom and everything
But see I aint the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down

On the oak tree I hope we feel like this forever
Forever forever ever Forever ever
Forever never seems that long until youre grown
And notice that the daybyday ruler cant be too wrong
Ms Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me thoughts of she thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me had
I pray so much about it need some knee pads
It happened for a reason one cant be mad
So know this know that everythings cool

But fuck that Im looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism like school lunches

You wanna approach us buzzards and vultures

Stack big bank honey folders

Leaping lizards keep me slizzard my minds expanding

Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers

Got a little baby girl four year Jordan
Never turn my back on my kids for them
Should have hit it quit it rag top
Before you reup get a laptop
Make a business for yourself boy set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four but we on a roll
Hold up slow up stop Control
Like Janet plan it Stankonias on ya
Moving like Floyd coming straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pulling off a belt cause a whippings in order
Like a threepiece fish fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell then I hit the border
Pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5
Im a microphone fiend tryin to stay alive
When you come to ATL boy you better not hide
Cause the Dungeon Family gon ride hah

Verse 1 Andr 3000
Hello lord its me again
I just wanna make love to the whole globe
And all her girlfriends
Now dont that make ya mind move
Like smoke patterns me on my way to Saturn wit a bomb
Namviet Viet or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast they know who gon win
Now wont that make us all fools like class clowns
Praying Private Ryan comes round
Sound travels at onethousandonethirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it hurry
When niggas stop biting thats when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick do you know what desire is Huh
Apparently not thats why you get what you got
Now answer this do you know what fire is Yeah
The body of hot the motivator of pots
Snot spit shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think Im finna vom
You move it like you mean it shell cum
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day play is no longer
The feelin gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

Verse 2 BReal
Look at the way you look at me I see it on your face
All your hate emanates but you still hesitate
Cause you want inside of my head but dont know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that I see the way you were
See the way you smirk
Im catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXLyoure a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
Im the outcast coming to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life thats come to pass
Dr pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
Im the bomb planted in your carwhy you frozen
Pop the tape in ignite the explosion
The world is mine the world is yours the world is ours
The world is lost the world is tossed

Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
Its kinda hard to execute when you aint feeling it that day
Jumpin the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the publics ears fucked up cant hear
Atlanta Georgia where yall at right here
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and ninevolt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace but then explode like booty traps

Verse 1 Big Boi
Back on the microphone your number one controller

Im so cold Im tryin to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life dont happen like its suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything dont always happen like you plan it
Demand it over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting cause its heated in the kitchen
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
Youve got to follow through struggle to complete your dreams
No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers 5417

Yeah too Democratic Republic fuck it
We chicken nugget we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Bluecollar scholars wholl take your dolla and wipe my ass with it
You living for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said Oh hell naw but yet its that too
You cant discrimahate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it
To put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision
Do you want to live or wanna exist
The game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

And Im free just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow just like a brook a stream the rain
And I fly just like a bird up in the sky
And Ill surely die just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day it turns to clay
It blows away it finds a ray it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe
Just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow just like a baby blossoming
And its beautiful
Thats life thats life

Feeling every drip drop she can generate imitate seesaws
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp simply cause he dont like love
What can make a nigga wanna ache break all rules

What can make a nigga wanna lose all faith in

Five thousand one hundred ten days is a short period of time
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what Im talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I shouldnt I I cant I have to Mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality fatality fatality fatality

Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity
With its own lusts its own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe
Engulfing encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep but not one of destruction
But of creation elation in the remaking
No faking in the relation no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
Til aint nothing but Stankonia

Hangin on my livin room wall my first joint and it went gold
I want to lamp I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight gettin my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now its just a big dream
Cause I find myself in a place where Im last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybodys doin bad
Yo mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin away I gotta make wakes
Receivin all types of calls from Upstate
Yo I cant cope with the pressure settlin for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind Ghostface carry a black 9 nigga

Im makin devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

Verse 2 Inspectah Deck
Well Im a sire I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah

Youll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Dont talk the talk if you cant walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk

Rebel to the grain theres no way to barricade me
Steamrollin niggas like an 18 wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin theres no survivin

Verse 6 Masta Killa
Homicides illegal and death is the penalty
One justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity
Its the master of the Mantis Rapture comin at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie paralyzin the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin contender

In the front in the back Killa Beez on attack

Verse 1 Raekwon
I grew up on the crime side the New York Times side
Stayin alive was no jive
Had secondhands Moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth yo rockin the gold tooth Lo goose
Only way I be gettin the G off was drug loot
And lets start it like this son
Rollin with this one and that one
Pullin out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin woolas at 16
And runnin up in gates and doin hits for high stakes
Makin my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better same damn Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sickass clique and went all out
Catchin keys from cross seas
Rollin in MPVs every week we made forty Gs
Yo nigga respect mine or here go the TEC9
ChchickPOW Move from the gate now

Chorus Method Man
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money
Dollar dollar bill yall
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money
Dollar dollar bill yall

Verse 2 Inspectah Deck
Its been twentytwo long hard years Im still strugglin
Survival got me buggin but Im alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
Tryin to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short now I face incarceration
Pacin goin upstates my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldnt be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin chase
Sellin base smokin bones in the staircase
Though I dont know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess thats the time when Im not depressed
But Im still depressed and I ask whats it worth
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
And stray shots all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shortys runnin wild smokin sess drinkin beer
And aint tryin to hear what Im kickin in his ear
Neglected for now but yo it gots to be accepted
That what That life is hectic

Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money

Roughneck Inspectah Decks on the set
The Rebel I make more noise than heavy metal

Verse 2 Raekwon
The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back relax wont smile

For cryin out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Theres more again catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats if Rap was a gun you wouldnt bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin star
Cause who I are is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Pointblank as I kick the square biz
There it is youre fuckin with pros and there it goes

Verse 6 RZA
Yo chill with the feedback black we dont need that
Its 10 oclock ho where the fucks your seed at
Feelin mad hostile wearin Aropostale
Flowin like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe then attack the globe
With the buckus style the ruckus
Ten times ten men committin mad sin
Turn the other cheek and Ill break your fuckin chin
Slayin boombangs like African drums
Hell be comin around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah another one dare
JuJuggerGenius take us the fuck outta here

Verse 7 GZA
The Wu is too slammin for these Cold Killin labels
Some aint had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they moneys gettin stuck to the gum under the table
Thats what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20watt light bulb
Shouldve pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors theyre scared to death to pump these
First of all whos your AR
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he dont know the meanin of dope
When hes lookin for a suitandtie rap
Thats cleaner than a bar of soap
And Im the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and lets have a mud fight

After laughter comes tears

Verse 1 RZA
Check the script me and the gods gettin ripped
Blunts in the dip forty dogs in my lip
Had a box boom boom the bass would blast
We was laughin at all the girls that passed
Conversation brothers had began to discuss
Hey yo Rob remember that kid you bust
Aw yeah he ran but he didnt get far
Cause I dropped him heh heh heh heh heh ha
Not knowin exactly what lied ahead
My little brother my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder its a hot day in the summer
Didnt expect to come across a crazy gunner
Hey Shorty check it for the bag and the dough
But he was brave looked him in the eye and said No
Money splattered him BOW Then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screamin the noise up and down the block
Hey Rakeem What Your little brother got shot
I ran frantically then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up then I held him by his head
His eyes shut thats when I knew he was
Aw man How do I say goodbye
Its always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks I was laughin all the time
I taught him all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

Chorus
After laughter comes tears

Verse 2 Ghostface Killah
Me and my man my ace Big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy you know how it is when youre blitzed
Three oclock in the mornin somethin got to give
Moe said hell go first I said Ill take next
Here take this raincoat and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore I said Be for real
Shes not even worth it to go raw deal
A mans gonna do what a mans gonna do
He got buttnaked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by Moe Im out without a doubt
Im not pumpin up I am airin out
Hey yo he came out laughin with glory
Im surprised hes still livin to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie like a Whammy he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with OPP
Aint nothin wrong but he got caught with the HIV
Now no life to live doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears

So I cant even see no more
Im calling my Black woman a bitch
Im calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
Im lost brother can you help me
Can you help me brother please

Uncle Pete
You see what we did we lost the love
Im talking bout the love the love of your own

Popa Wu
But brother but brother but brother check this out
I still dont understand man Im all high off this shit man

Uncle Pete
Well what Im trying to say my brother
Why why do we kill each other
Look at our children what kind of a future

Popa Wu
This is the training thats gonna be given to you by the Wu
Brothers and sisters

The revolution the revolution will be televised televised televised

Its time to rise and take our place so we can inherit the universe
The planet Earth belongs to God

This is nineteenninetyseven

Every square inch of it that he chose for himself is the best part
Behind every strong woman youll find a strong man
And behind every strong man youll find a strong woman
The universe is not completed without the sun moon and stars
Want to be free
Thats man woman and child
To all you fakeass niggas who think you gonna survive out here
Without your Black woman youre wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
We are original man the Asiatic Black man
The maker the author the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million with the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million four billion four hundred million
All over the planet earth
Mandela Mandela
Arise you Gods its the time for the revolutional war
Malcolm X Malcolm X
Thats the mental war
Thats the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns the alcohol and everything
Thats the mental devil that exists within your body
Thats destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Dont look towards the sky cause theres no heaven above
Dont look down beneath your feet theres no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through

Uncle Pete
There is only one God
There is a whole new one faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah

Popa Wu
At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless Im dumb deaf and blind
You ever heard about the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind that has a beginning to him
And his ending is about to come

Uncle Pete
If you take one step I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain swim the deepest sea with you my brother
I know you got to be strong gotta hold on

Popa Wu
Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
Theyre slaves of the mental powers
They dont know who the true and living God is
And their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And theyre easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you cant see him with the physical eyes
Theyre also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims and Muslims sons
Peace we out

Cut to KungFu clip
I have given it much thought
It seems disaster must come
At best only postponed
Shaolin KungFu
To survive must now be taught to more young men
We must expand get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread

Verse 1 GZA
Reunited double LP world excited
Struck a match to the underground industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off softass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions throwing your best known compositions
You couldnt add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from getting visuals is habitual
Youre more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall formed a mural
He took a look saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster thats impossible to manage

Verse 2 Ol Dirty Bastard
Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus making no fuss I gots tough love
Unglove the noose watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse heavy at the booze
I dont walk I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall looking properly
But comely I UFO you Wright Brothers

Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us

Solid as a rock when I strike target
Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
Herbals got me where I wanna be right now
Dont know the time
Check the hour on your sundial watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
Each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew SUUUUUUUUUUU Enter the Wu
36 more deadly Chambers to take you through

Verse 1 Inspectah Deck
My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze my solar raysll burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves catch this rap page
I glide like hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master with the faster blade track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Nonfiction the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance dominant intelligence
Wu original true colors step from the melanin
The most high most try to get close by
And overthrow I but choke with they hopes up high
I circulate the tristate and vibrate beyond the Richter
Fly sistas flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten poly like Cochran and Sharpton
Narrow margin of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog observe the stats

Verse 2 Masta Killa
Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The WuTang Dynasty has emerged
From this elite fleet I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe
Seeds of MCs that these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off the chrome might tend to squeeze off
And spray an array of shots
That travel downwind just respect my prolific pen
As I ascend the minds of the weak
To rise and take power Eiffel towering over the land
As we stand expanding our cream
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned

Chorus
Oh baby for heavens sake
Oh baby for heavens sake

Verse 3 Cappadonna
Yo yo this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Darts blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here my year drop the stupid LPs everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavyhanded locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates sneak inside the club low eyes
Low down dirty twelve thirty night time crawlers
Offthewallers basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nineseven
Slang reverend put the best work in

Shake them niggas

Verse 1 Raekwon
Scary hours no money out smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield Lucille switched cracks on shields
Shes a rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirtyfive beans
Hit the cell phone regulate with well known Tone
A Wally kingpin who also slam the strike edition
What up Corleone smoke the bone Tone phone me
What up He tried to slang there address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air Rastafarian bird piping that
Switchin Benzes ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like hes sitting on a lump hes sitting on junk
You wanna pull a heist draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned theyre Century Fox little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks wheelyin blocks
Rich lifestyle spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now Sun it still shine shed light now
Breakdown liquidate God fucking grab the nickel plate
Spenser For Hire tension when we mention Dryer
Hes a slave cop behave pop
Isuzu Beige Top will blow that cat at the Purple Haze spot

Verse 2 Method Man
I remember sticking fiends at the onesixooh
When we was starving ducking fiveoh paying em dues
Times is hard in the slums Im from they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging slipping cracks in
Your camouflaging now you snitching on the squadron
Thats something niggas cant pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and WuWear garment
So I see no need to mention the potency
Of a sting from a killa bee kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high you hijack
These friendly skies aint for you they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung aint got to tell you where its coming from

Bridge Method Man  La the Darkman
Catch us swimming with these sharks now you rap villains
I feel the same way you niggas feeling
We feel the same way you feeling let it be known let it be known
What the blood clot you niggas dealing you crash dummies
Cash rules still dont nothing move but the money

Verse 3 Ghostface Killah
Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas nameplate dude lost weight
Summer 88 started a fight that cant wait
Ask Dorothy same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like a hundred ounces Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch ass no trousers
This souped up individual stuck the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver Un threw up all in his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His shapeup was all fucked up Heze had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo stacking his shit financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out

Verse 1 Method Man
Apocalypse Now mind over matter
Next batter be Tical put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with
Murder track what Slang killing it touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong one thousand lashes

Verse 2 Raekwon
Detonate that pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys Oakland As stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice finger itchy like lice hair fell out
Something to conquer stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck yall act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis chilling like
long inhale

Verse 3 Masta Killa
As my brothers and I reign rebellious changing
The courses of time devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine all minds one no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing you must take Allah for fool
Wheres his Jewel Was he using Mathematics as a tool
Tell me the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking seeking where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm

Verse 4 Inspectah Deck
Mind arson my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls Im wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house its girls night out pull a handful
Heavenly laced stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

Verse 5 Ghostface Killah
Magnificent heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent Range whipping Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings suplexed off the rope magazine
Coconut juice walnut colored shoe ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third kids back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death Kobayashi couldnt stop me
Getting caught up in my world HagenDazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl cave your whole world in

Verse 1 GZA
Yo too many songs weak rhymes thats mad long
Make it brief Son half short and twice strong
No doubt it took time searchin eventually
It was prime urgent for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MCs with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt until twenty thou out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You cant flow must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Venue packed a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldnt recognize blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin
Catch a single deal a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardless to whom or what five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony drop twentyfive flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars his prints on the strings of his guitar

Chorus Ol Dirty Bastard
As high as WuTang get
Allah allow us pop this shit

Verse 2 Method Man
Tical got a hold on ya doin exactly

Deep in the dirty dungeon buggin lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched John John
Bring the phenomenon I cold crush
MC inferiorities they froze up ice cold
As we move on saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo INS another code red danger break out the vest
Now its tactical warfare its all here
Come with your shield and hardware it be on here
Dont ever roam in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable
Conditionin be critical
Peace to Tang gettin high on your physical dis next drink

Verse One UGod
Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust rec room style for you brothers
Times ticking erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial style jab vocab slow
Alphabet run construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model
For a breather dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down come with something thats round and profound
Blood brothers people of colors we get down
Watch this fly force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle serious a man
My mic clapper death wish everlasting plan
Heavenly God body know me as the cleaner
Night champion old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama fly swatters

Break
Number two Chao San Poi

Verse Two GZA
This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks thats rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isnt enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggasperfect your own speech
Shit is copper it aint worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura

Verse Three Raekwon
Twist the DAC up them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up fiftytwo block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick shes German Luger
Get the shit on light a fresh pack bust it open
With the seal on Dunn deal on this with the real on
Necks rocky ring call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer home decorater player
Mic immigrants nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy God deadarmed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make ShortyWop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me

Verse Four RZA
Yo MCs wonder whats Hip Hop thunder
Tell you the truth its just one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz
Yo inhale this paraphernalia a Wu memorabilia
Melba the fortune teller tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we scoop up CREAM like Breyers
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirtysix assorted Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded youre fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body with five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin well brush you

Break
Hes a womanizer but hes an expert at throwing knives

Verse Five Masta Killa
Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley niggas couldnt fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live Glocks I hold
Shots I give while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and whos liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme fiend for the capo
Regimes of the WuTang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery

Verse 1 Ghostface Killah
Ayo I roll like a bat out of hell evil acapells fly
Spitting out of my grill before I hit the sky
With springtime colors juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair plus yours the look gold
God the old chain and ball technique got these
Vegetable lasagna niggas in they whips jumping out they seats
18 Bronzeman Part II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice we in your hood we might circle
Hats down low in the Range switch lanes
Change my tire peel out real loud on the stage yo
I shitted on your hood kid I shitted on your hood
Got to your burner too late Im looking real good
Draped out shining like a fresh fifty cent piece
Yo girlfriend come here oh shit you my mans niece
The gourmet pocket twenty bombs made of clay
Sexcapades take place we fucking 48 shades
Might walk up in your studio time slap your engineer
Lighter fluid to DAT style hand me the matches now

Verse 2 Raekwon
Ayo rainbow Rollie on the wrist now whats this
Niggas bless this eight and a half Bally banana twist
E shakes puffing on lye feeding the seeds plate
Pulling out old 38s to rob gates
Major wake up the kid telltales make a nigga head wake up
Beats break the nigga whipped take off his time
Honolulu status gladdest the rich rock cabbage
And dollar vans grands that nigga mad savage
Stationary Hall of Justice niggas came clumped out
Just came home now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life til the Sun burn out
Thats my word move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinking roll with the Mac bent Ac10
Most of my team Five Percent
Check what the live said rolling with Guess vests pedestrians
Yo holding my nuts fucking thousand dollar lesbians

Chorus Ghostface Killah  Raekwon
Yo the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord and live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind
Yo the Older God put me on to how to rock this
Maintain 360 Lord and live prosperous
It only takes a lesson a day just to analyze life
One time in the respectable mind

Verse 3 GZA
Let the shot spark soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs theres no escapement
Gunned down three in town hit king from seven crowns
Spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded back in the 83 summer heat
Up in 309 park rhyming off the drummers beat
I stalk the city streets demonstrating mic wrecks
All looking stank I aint playing with a full deck
And as they nervously stare I know they scared
They saw the coming of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name assassin Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posses the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite camouflage and blend
Those that got styles they got identical twins
Dont stretch the small thing copycats are finicky
Without skills they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age

You my Dirty whore you that Dirty whore
What else you gonna do to it
But bust it bust it though baby bust it
Who else who else is gonna do it
This is dedicated to all you bitches

Verse 1 Ol Dirty Bastard
Knew this bitch named Trash she had a hella fine ass
Cant ask blew my hope in the past
Niggarette gave me gonorrhoea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you should have seen her
She had a baby face creamer Purinas called up talking Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon I had her walking on the Moon

Verse 2 Cappadonna
I seen you at the five and dime wasting your time
Oh you shine Im looking at your ass from behind
You walked by smelling like watermelon
You might make me a felon my eyeballs swelling
My nuts start yelling excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you Im sick
My medicine is can I walk with you
Fantasy after that we can cheat
Laid on the bed handcuffed with hard meat Long stroke smacking smack it then broke
Nothing cant stop my continuous poke
Compound porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it

Verse 3 Ol Dirty Bastard
Dirt Dog be bouncing on bitches like frog
I pollute the air up like smog bitch
Im up my jacuzzi peeping this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy
Dirt Dog aint choosy pussy move me
Pretty black dick up in the booty I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Dont got no fucking room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze bitch you a tease
Titties small I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit Im through with this bitch
Old hen please cant get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty Gs overseas
Im doing the breeze in my 850

Verse 4 RZA
Suicidal she been in more hotels than bibles
Idol worshipping bitch wasnt the type to make bridle
Strung on how the bitch manoeuvred her tongue
From the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasnt choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf cigarette
Pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sinning against their women
And enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was nonvoid
And shameless her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession caused niggas to get the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied said she had Urinary Tract Infection
I tried to warn em and bomb em but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom

woman moans oooooh ahahhh ohh

Outro 4 Assassins samples
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible

If we die the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed

Intro Inspectah Deck
Yo This goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated for those who aint make it

Verse 1 Inspectah Deck
Yo in the housing thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways memories stays engraved
All my live brothers is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger blind to these lies they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men women and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex thats in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle cant let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase performing a sting
Its hard to keep control I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold and they eventually sold
Their life and times deadly like the virus design
But too minute to dilute the scientist mind

Chorus Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa Both
You cant party your life away Drink your life away
Smoke your life away Fuck your life away
Dream your life away Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Verse 2 Masta Killa
A voice cries from the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations babies being born with
Disfigurations experimentations
On their faces there bear worryations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This cant be little Hussein his uncle cries
As he drops to his nephews side holding his cane
Just give me a name of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness and left us to witness

Verse 3 UGod
Yeah yo Curses from war innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways hands solemn in praise
Tree of life more precious than rubies golden game
The wise shall flourish inherit Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion vision
Blow spin and sin and killing whats revealing
Its a never ending battle with no ending or beginning listen
Zero process progress become the hunted
Americas most wanted good life flaunted want it
Some love the speed some satisfy a need
Some want to be down young gun seed jungle breed
The strong must feed someone die someone bleed
One flew astray and it caught my little seed
Can it be the ice savage trife life made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes pipes
Take in my energy breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best

Chorus Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa Both
You cant party your life away Drink your life away
Smoke your life away Fuck your life away
Dream your life away Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Verse 4 RZA
Yall bitches love dances and pulling down your pants
While your mans on tour your spending up his advances
Your friends aint shit all they do is drink smoke and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in six
You either high school dropouts one to three copouts
Fifteen years old shorty ass and top out
Ninetynine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade minimum wage Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab Im going mad
Took two drags off the blunts and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites through the night by the dawn
Early light why is sons fighting for the stripe

Verse 5 Method Man
As we dwell through this concrete hell calling it home
Mama say take your time young man and build your own
Dont wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream no more kings
The cash rule everything now we going down
These babies looking up to us its up to us
The Million Man March MCs get on the bus
But envy greed lust and hate separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer brothers we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel killing each other

Chorus Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa Both
You cant party your life away Drink your life away
Smoke your life away Fuck your life away
Dream your life away Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right I might find me a suite
Its a quarter full moon I arrive women swoon
Well groomed dance hall packed full room
Lady move peep my glide peep my zoom
Keep in stride smoke the la smoke the boom
Feel the fumes consume toxic tunes
Hellbound species forty ounce typhoon
The ultraviolet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble Ark builders Gods thrust
Beams of light stop your breathing its hunting season
Honey eyeballing down for no reason
Grab her close play post wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight  Its yours

Verse 3 RZA
Stop the fader of the RAM blast more watts through my preamp
Them cant stress the beat vamp the shitll get blamp
At full throttle hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles leave you stiff as models
You fag you couldnt pull one drag off my blunt
You couldnt punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs cant fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

Verse 4 Inspectah Deck
Its only natural actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold check the sick shit explicit

Rebel I outlaw split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C4

Check out my beaver baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son thats my word
Spot a rapper run him down throw him out in the third yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down six to go flash his strobe lights
Im open RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts heres a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks rock the W and Spiegel books
AnheuserBusch kings came through and stopped your whole juks
Spitfire Kangols watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news like when your man go
Ends blow windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song now watch her water break

Intro Ol Dirty Bastard
What yall thought yall wasnt gonna see me
Im the Osiris of this shit
WuTang is here forever motherfuckers
This like this 97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Lets do it like this
Ima rub your ass in the moonshine
Lets take it back to 79

Verse 1 Inspectah Deck
I bomb atomically Socrates philosophies and hypotheses
Cant define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery possibly they spotted me
Battlescarred Shogun explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked performing live on your hottest block

Verse 2 Method Man
As the world turns I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence the hardheaded never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire transform into the Ghost Rider
A sixpack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back
In the line of fire holding back
What My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at
Niggas is strapped and theyre tryna twist my beer cap
Its court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot We smoke pot
And blow spots you want to think twice I think not
The Iron Lung aint got to tell you where its coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

Verse 3 Cappadonna
I twist darts from the heart tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks certified chatterbox
Vocabulary Donna talking tell your story walking
Take cover kid what Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your six cant rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect arts and crafts paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all yall to all praise due to God

Interlude Ol Dirty Bastard
The saga continues
WuTang WuTang

Verse 4 UGod
Olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory the agony of defeat
We crush slow flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh conquer its war
Allow us to escape Hell globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom tranquilized with anaesthesias
My orchestra graceful music ballerinas
My music Sicily rich California smell
An axe kill adventure paint a picture well
I sing a song from SingSing sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon rotating ring kings

Verse 5 RZA
March of the wooden soldiers CCypherPunks couldnt hold us
A thousand men rushing in not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like Flair
Escape from your dragons lair
In particular my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like Im fucking ducking fiveyear probation

Verse 6 GZA
War of the masses the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray niggas get slayed on the song

Verse 7 Masta Killa
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds thats heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the WuTang Clan
As we engage in battle the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Verse 8 Ghostface Killah
Yo yo yo fuck that look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Pumas on my mans rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend bitches overheard you scream
You twofaces scum of the slum I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in 81
Sound convincing thousand dollar corkpop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston get fly permission
Hold the fuck up Ill unfasten your wig bad luck
I humiliate separate the English from the Dutch
Its me black Noble Drew Ali came in threes
We like the Genovese sazon season these degrees
Its Earth 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence the wave burst split the megahertz

Verse 9 Raekwon
Aiyo thats amazing gun in your mouth talk verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer BlueTang all up in the highriser
New York Yank visor word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean see yall the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made em jump like Rod Strickland

Verse One RZA
Fusion of the five elements to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate livin irrelevant
The most benevolent king communicatin through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted Allahs heard and seen
Everywhere throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere thermosphere stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
EightyFive percent tenants depended welfare recipients
Stapletons been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes then examinated
Blood contaminated vaccinated lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization Food and Drug Administration
Testing poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron

Verse Two UGod
United Nations gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural a capella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon military bomb fest
We want sanitary food planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco body shit
Get your shit together fore the fuck Illuminati hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep jewels keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind elevate stay behind
The sun gotta shine keep on cremate
The whole Babylon times up move on
Kings on your pawn checkmate no fakes
Supposed through the gate case closed
Things get froze when it comes time chosen ones
Will holding guns we take flight with no fright
And attack never fear cause our words is clear
Whats been done cant be undone Son we cant care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind we unified as one
Half of black folk we half broke smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlasting essence stay flying over Egypt

Hook Tekitha
For you to defeat the Gods
Impossible you can never defeat
The gods
Impossible
For you to defeat the Gods

Verse Three Ghostface Killah
Call an ambulance Jamie been shot word to Kimmy
Dont go son nigga you my motherfucking heart
Stay still son dont move just think about Keeba
Shell be three in January your young God needs ya
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back excuse me bitch gimme your jack
One seven one eight nine one one low battery damn
Blood comin out his mouth he bleedin badly
Nahhh Jamie dont start that shit
Keep your head up if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In SixtyNine his father and mines they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left told me rock it with respect
I opened it seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one oh shit here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw kissed him
Rubbed his hair turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the blue coats Officer Lough took it as a joke
Weeks ago he stripsearched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car Dirty Tasha are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher blood on his Wallys like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It cant be from Yoohoo to Lees
Second grade humped the teachers about to leave
Finally this closed chapter comes to an end
He was announced pronounced dead yall at twelve ten

Outro Raekwon and Tekitha
Now what my man is trying to tell yall
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin and we decreasing
So at the same time when you play with guns
When you play with guns son
That causes the conflict of you going against your own
You hear me so lets pay attention
Straight up and down cause this is only a story
From the real

She fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown

Hook
Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto street

Verse 2 Cappadonna
Yo all of yall niggas got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this not a licensed driver
Show yall niggas whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your clich
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I aint friends with you only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue
Its my turn live niggas could pass
Twofaced rappers push they shit last
Straight off the edge into the rubbish
Peep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my thoughts get published

Outro
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility

Little ghetto boy playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up

What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility

Little ghetto boy playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility

Intro Masta Killa
As we return to the 36 Chambers
The RZA the GZA the Ol Dirty BZA
UGod Chef the Ghostface Killah
And Meth Rebel I soldier for the foreclosure
Dont forget about the Masta yo

Verse 1 Masta Killa
Motherfuckers halt when my Colt start stomping
Thunder strikes your land with the jolt
Your stamina level is low like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye cant detect
The infantry peep the weapontry as I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
Ive not yet begun to stung its the ethics
And rigorous training methods of the Abbott
Incite oversees the opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates breaking down your resistance
Leaving competition defenceless
Masta hiphop antagonizer
Dumb deaf and blind civilizer with the silencer

Verse 2 UGod
Piledriver Tut boulder face blow Hulk
Anger rap book causing chess blade smoke
Monster truck punk elephant gun poke
Jawbreaker humanoid vice grip choke
Face the inferno maestro pull it
Pipe hard slang bite the golden bullet
Never sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away freeze back feedback play out in sweet
Action packed rap bite it stomp on the beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth Tony Atlas
Wu status now wisdom to the masses

Verse 3 RZA
Cock back my tongue like a hammer
My head is like a nickelplated bammer
Spit 45 caliber grammar
At the speed of wind makes you bleed within
Crack your skull without penetrating your skin
Reign of champ official Wu stamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programming fat tracks at Camp Crystal

Verse 4 Method Man
Home on the range rebel with a pen
Writing critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mr Mef Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my sex pistol deal me in

Verse 5 RZA
The bewildering Killa Bee quickly sting ya
I aint gotta lift one fucking finger
Make sure the God Irief turns on the ringer
We ducking the subpoena
Fatal Flying Guillotine machine from Medina

Verse 6 Masta Killa UGod  GZA
Check the 150 millimeter heater
As it blows holes through your fucking speaker
Making you weaker creeping inches centimeters
Fifty caliber street sweeper
Shots from Shaolin that go to Massapequa

Verse 7 Method Man
Thingsll never be the same after this one
Ghostrider spit flame lay back and twist one
Recognize the Gods came for one accord
One mind and one common cause thats the shit son
Play them crows out position you might hear me
But you dont listen competition come and get some on
Red marker still bleeding through the paper
Of his sick premeditated murder caper

Verse 8 StreetLife
I walk with the Shaolin strut burn a dutch
Watch Street eat em up Cold Crush bum rush
Spot rusher get touched bagged up handcuffed
Yall niggas cant fuck with us

Verse 9 Ghostface Killah
Pass me the Black Velvet embassy suite killing me
Spell it Maxi Priest caught me in a daze up on Delancey Street
Stand solar deadly vengeance with a crowbar
Its like the dreads worshiping Jah so Aloha
Pineapple crush 850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spitting off the roof holding my change
Yo its ragtime universal 12 Monkey mind
Its like stalking through your airport with a chunky 9

Verse 10 StreetLife
The underboss Staten New York
Bloodsport gun talk holding fort back take em to court
Its the burner Shaolin bound face down you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked stretched on a back block
Yo its warfare when you ring here slugs fly through midair
Landing thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron where the head rest for the conquest subway
Wordplay ricochet through your projects crime pays
Matched up in a staircase in a dark place embraced
By the treyeight Im in so deep I cant escape
These crime situations I stay in man formation
A shot echoes through the ghetto locations yall remain
PLO slam cats like Bam Bam Bigelow
Throw a flow like Nomo relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro hanging MCs by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno

Intro Inspectah Deck
Aiyyo yo eight niggas down just enough
Fuckin around with my sound city
Yo bring backup city
Fuckin with me and mine
Murderous check it yo

Verse 1 Inspectah Deck
The world is shifty we living just enough for the city
The rough witty Killa Bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone foes attempt to gradually clone
Labelled MIA and I send the casualties home
In closed coffins Wu storming like the light brigade
Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon inside the cyber age
Crime pays the laws long arm be tryna strong arm
Walking timebombs who thrive on firearms
The charm smoker I hit the dread with a poster
We told em to show him love and exposed the black toaster
Composer was shook I took your bad looks for joke
Get your back broke deep throat this Murder I Wrote
The antidote be seeking like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted Dead or Alive Rebel I escapes
Across the desert sand leaving no footprints to trace
Keep a war face your place conceal the baby knives
On the North breaks I still shine in shady times

Hook Inspectah Deck
We living just enough living just enough
Just enough for the city for the city
Just enough for the city

Verse 2 Inspectah Deck
In the jungle I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off DOC be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my guidance
The facts tell gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence a vision
This is way beyond four corners escape this mental prison
Before were all goners now embrace the world
Before the World War explosive bomber visionary soldier karma
My code of honor mind still scarred from the drama
Trauma sent to victim witness them run scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die son its bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The futures here catch me on computer software
Warfares inevitable Rebel I hold several government official
Issue 38 specials that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but Im taking 40 devils

Hook Inspectah Deck
We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the city

Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open push your seat back just flow
Thats how we doing it

Verse 1 Raekwon
Bound by honest sword take over the set rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the TEC crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamills Whitewater Scandal
Wally sandal just a sample my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
One nasty can blew my pen sterile wont perform if Im not lampable
Asking my manll get you slapped down play the anthem
Lit it who with it champagne get it thats the ticket
Silent nines sounding like crickets snatch your workers shipment
Pull her hair long dick it we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve guess who ripped it

Chorus UGod Raekwon
Projects My niggas survive just like a movin target
Projects Where niggas live and some sell garbage thats
Projects Try to escape the flying shells dodging
New York projects Im living large yo stop miraging

Verse 2 Method Man
Sign of the times conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune theres a crime
This technique is TEC9
Blast at any close encounter of the third kind
This be the evil that man do we dismantle any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and cant handle my flurry
Hear me you jam on you want to scare me
Dont even kid me shit in my coat aiming at your kidney
Pressure red hot like chilli pepper
Black n Decker hardware avoid the leper
Five oclock shadowboxer hold down the sector
Bet your bottom dollar lecture be hard to swallow
007 mark the secret agent
That macks well and gets smart through entertainment
Welcome to the killing fields with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas going through changes

Chorus UGod Raekwon
Projects My niggas survive just like a movin target
Projects Where niggas live and some sell garbage thats
Projects Try to escape the flying shells dodging
New York projects Im living large yo stop miraging

Verse 3 Ghostface Killah
Suck my dick its the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into your face plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees with your sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole think I can fit three
Your pink lips spreaded and shit let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Pingpong pussy wide world the womb
Titties sagging stomach on some shriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screaming that its talking to you daddy
Farts breathing out your lips splashing my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Almighty dick ran in with a cape some call him engine
Lightning rod bob black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a Great Adventure cigar in your garage
Frightening pussy have you fall out like Remy on the house
Watch the teeth for sobbing my shit you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy leave the friction burns plus beef I hone
The condom broke bitch you got AIDS Im shaking in my bones

Intro UGod
Give me the cue

Verse 1 UGod
Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the phantasm
Verbal smarts spark the word visit my scripture
Exotic wine holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down would you crown renowned kings

Verse 2 Method Man
Theres no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs thumbs down
Prepare Killa bees it be warfare this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair truth or dare
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on youve been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon how many bomb
Must we drop in the NinetyNow
Walk a mile in my shoes get the street news from MethTical

Break RZA
Glocksll be spitting you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocksll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo

Verse 3 RZA
Its common sense how I master my circumference you dense
I get locked the fuck up released on my own recognizance
Cant be judged young bloods bust back like scuds
WuTang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level yo I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style your weak proposal
Aim for the official initial is Ruler ZigZagZig Allah
All that other bullshit aint permissible
Annual increase of the WuTang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible every egg aint edible
My tracks remain Unforgettable like Ol Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Buy Melchezidek a skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor WuTang

Verse 4 Masta Killa
The weight of the fam is on our back and we cant fall
Victim to this long hall of fame meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That cant be contained WuTang

You talking bout he what he what he what he did
Told them he cut his eye in sparring

Slam dance tarantula style yous a fan of the
Monopoly king Slavic poetry

Mack truck hitting soloist Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth fist swift and boneless

Verse Ghostface Killah Raekwon Both
Yo up in the MGM coked up psych
Six niggas walked in flashing they gems peace Aight
One dark skinned nigga fiftysix inch rope wrapped around twice
Smash the Gilligan boat with ice
They threw sign language ordered hot coffee
Wit a danish
Relax whispered they Rap entertainers
Had Lizzy on two Japanese birds with furs look good kid
Laid back handling hors dourves
Its like round three We too black for BET
You memorize the 1 to 40 Im at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesnt perform his duty what shall be done
Pardon me God that nigga got a gun
Bulging out his sweatpants check out his stance
See the side of his grill Look like my cousin Lance
Left hand rocky Guess watch Yo I think I did his Clarks
He wanted crush bone leather with the strings dark
Now I remember He from Bear Mountain
He and Mitch Greene shot the fair one Near the water fountain
Seventh round Chavez bleeding from his right ear
Yo keep your eye on that same nigga from right here
Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne
Ghost had the fly Gucci mocks wit no socks on
Seen Deion Sanders in the back with the phat fur on
Working them hoes with the fly Wu shirts on
Mixed drink session Dun Pour me some more
Chef leathered down blinking at Chant Moore
Tenth round Chavez tearing em down Sweet Pea get ya shit off
Its like blacks against the Germans Getting hit off
Smooth and them walked in Brownsville representing
They sent a bottle over autograph blessing
Chef pull out the doodoo twist the dank  pink noodles
Yo Im bout to roll one Matter fact twist two of those
Yo they wound up stopping the fight
Steels took a point away from Chavez

Verse 1 Raekwon
My team be bellyaching hungry niggas on the swarm again
Piranha nigga bite dick yo son its on again

Listen kid yo you was born to be a pawn but Im a bishop
Back to the novel yo Son its logical
How you figure God What Flow on the track flip the obstacle
Now my proposal rips the global
From California to courts its over God told taste the soul food
Remember baggy jeans Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what My Wallys got messed up
Autograph pressed up what blessed enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that Land O Lake that Mazola rap
Will get you sent back represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians la costra nostra
We moving through your hood like we supposed to
Flexing Lexi Diamonds hold the settlement
Tekitha bust your gun boo like that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Ad on the billboard store check it now you get the gold dick award
Its like jail and its the sixth floor
Test me floating in the SE now lets see
Half of yall niggas built your vine from my stress tree
Faggots homos yo my flavor liver than adobo
Stay militant kid twist ya like Bolo
You fucking idiot playing with my Clan but you be fearing it
Fake one Im guaranteed to make you take one

Tired of yall mostly inspired by yall
So what the deal now link up with us or put your shield down faggot

Break RZA and Raekwon
Faggot you fuck around punk seven fifteen
We battle for cream nigga

Verse 2 RZA
You want a pound crab Nah let his hand swing
I ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings
No more said knew your chump ass was dead
When I saw the 44 reflecting off your shiny forehead
Its WuTang nigga aint nothing changed nigga
Still Shame on a Nigga who tried to run game
Your version of perversion fucking bitches on Persian rugs
Washing niggas like detergent its the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steeles 12 gauge front page Daily Chronicle reads
Hell up in Gotham take heed and protect your seeds
You fall like autumn leaves
You lack tranquillity in your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone ancient poems of poetry
Old scrolls explosive head bullets black hooded Timberland footed ninjas
With Full Metal Jacket clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price
Im certainly a heist for your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly WuTang Clan rules society
Because of variety so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me diary ya Irie
I need 18 points on my next joint
This high anointed king to make a deal I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must have been sniffing
To catch something so dope it left Monica Lynch pussy dripping
I fuck hundreds of bitches and split millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor legal caine grind like Nicaragua
I gave birth to MCs thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dicks been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the worlds best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the onetwenty lessons
Or my queen and my seed and the home that I rest in
Enter my zone get blown in 99 sections

Verse 3 Method Man
This rhyme has no limitation this time theres no hesitation
Collecting minds at the door
You want it niggas its yours the flavors raw
What the fuck you think Im flowing for Its rhyme and reason
Bite the bullet niggas is fowl and its duck season
We at odds till we even motherfucker
Bad asses high times lower classes
Taste mine straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to him room service under pressure
And mad nervy waving guns at the clergy
Ticallion we aint worried keep them sick niggas 730
Picture this watch the birdy
These bastards is old and dirty with sharp hymns
That be stabbing you pins and needles needles and pins
Nough said dick in your mouth like Tempest Bled
As I race track with thoroughbreds ducking the Feds

Verse 4 Raekwon
Yo my ice look fly upon the keyboard son
Niggas ran up on me lord praising what we do by the laws
Thats right exile the fake hit them niggas like weight
Feed em food let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction thats the whole science on my production
Yall niggas guess who stuck son left his nuts hung
Switch finger itch staring at you like a bitch
Maybe yall niggas snitch
Yous a loner Adidas shell top while I sip a Corona
Read the Robb Report then bone her
Buy you some jewels heres some food
Not necessarily mean to be rude boo check out the analoo
We in the mushrooms chased the Heineken the custom
Baggy jeans thick ropes god sliding through customs
Chill yall niggas know what time it is
James Bond beamers behind me on Bacardi Limon
Check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan he caught a slug for lying
Yeah you was lying wheres the cash crying
Militia rolling in position Casa Blanca Cuban Link Christian
Lex retali back whistling fake fucks

Verse 1 Raekwon
Blade thrower sword swinga killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas name your GodU Kareema

Ray Catena cut your joint Wolverine
The Longines wrapped around the wrist law seen her
How I got that yo threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot seen her it richocheted tapped Tina
Now Im out lampin in Korea with Talima
We moseyin sweatsuit Adidas best believe

Verse 2 Inspectah Deck
Yo this is MC wizardry killa bee invasion
Men of respect blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles straight out the basement
I suplex your rep left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites double edge dice your larynx
My hiphop is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock its like bblock and EGlocks
Youre ill your trail ends thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like the big eights for takin up space
Never did fear em stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine burns your retina
Urban journal plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after I be Self Lord And Master

Verse 3 Ol Dirty Bastard
I be the Ironside get touched with the chloride
Take walk with the NineFinger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown iodine

Verse 4 UGod
Yo box talk sequence powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty wet buttnaked with my dick out
Im direct golden best golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot dummyclapped mummywrapped and stitched
The Jeffrey Dahmer Notre Damer sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank harmony cake cut
A can of asswhoopin Flurry shake break you fucks
Struck love crooks waffle iron hooks
Chef cocaine cook a marvelous book
This deathbed doctrine paper for the youth
What remains a sabertoothed tiger in the booth

Verse 5 Cappadonna
Last night I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life females are trife stay tight
I detect that parasite satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped
Come to do shows my slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic Im the poor black man
Working hard for the grand I understand clear
Dont fear peep my new gear its different from yours
My style drop like drawers you see me on tours
Dont you wait to say peace the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track just then the core attack
Wu article Cappa five CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold bangle never make me throw darts
Check out my arts when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts aim me at the charts

Massage peppermint oil shampoo and pears
Cinnamon aloe natural for you hair
Soak lavender soap coconut conditioning
Honey lather blood flowing love listening
Motion lotion breeze over the ocean

Hot milk bath steam shower rubbin
Diesel splash long lovin in your oven
Bake it off break it off til it gets soft
Passion fruit pussy cat want to touch it off
In and out fragrance patience Hersheys Kisses Guinness Stout
Stress reliever soak your feet air them out
Brain message think about pink
Stress relieving no dishes in the sink
Upper lower left right neck dont play
Back rub Calgon take me away
Waterfall beads streams plush and lavish
Comfort me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea sipping tea
You and your queen melodies and trees 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze
Sprinkle water on chocolate butter scotch flowers
Vapor action tropical sunshower
Baby powder relax feel for an hour
Sand suntan snuggled up snug
Snowey days fireplace oriental rug
Thugs lay on the couch pull it out perfect balance
Chemical stimuli two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence what surround us
Whats the finest wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat flutes play jazz music puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed early morning sun treats
Sunset level suprise sunrise sail
Lay on the couch while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel Barry White acapell
Violin good medicine sound swell
Sunshine life love right without the hell
Taste sugar quiet storm seasick
Slowdance drink like nights over Egypt
Having stabbing calm chilling now we rolling
Company ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force warm tingle of the golden
Open loose ice cubes kiss your belly
Alcohol palm trees peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl fantastic melodies
Soon taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon fly wine quiet storm
Now its high noon raspberry spices
Cherry breath drink from the mountain sip the very best
Sounds of the shore every winter is a war
Paradise life recipe now pour
Musicness model gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through the threshold do my duty
Happy ending go to rest Sleeping Beauty

Outro UGod
Yo this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear champagne bubble bath
Heavy smack on that ass like that

Damn man these radio stations be bugging
Its three oclock in the morning
Damn this hip hop shit just keep it
They gotta slow this shit down man you know what I mean

Verse 1 Tekitha
Fiends were never waiting in the hill
They ran one step ahead
But the jiggy was always there
Upon the project pavement
There was death enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
As I lay there with my baby
We would look from the window and cry
Then suddenly in the sky
Between the new world ages
We were blessed and WuTang fills the ear
With the melody of a train Lord is suddenly here

Chorus Tekitha
False MCs are melting in the dark all the weak LPs are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape out early May
And I dont think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hiphop gamell never be the sammmmmmme

WuTang WuTang WuTang

Verse 2 Tekitha
Upon the project pavement
There was death enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
Between the new world ages
We were blessed and WuTang fills the air
With the knowledge that God posses
As I lay there with my baby
We would look from the window and cry
Then the WuTang sign appears in the sky

Chorus Tekitha
Billboards started melting in the dark all the weak MCs are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape of Earthly pain
And I dont think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hiphop gamell never be the sammmmme
And I dont think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hiphop gamell never be the sammmmme

Is stay close to your families and all your loved ones
Cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
They killin for pennies knahmsayin
Peace to the Gods we got a heavy job yo yo

Trouble follows behind a wicked mind 2020 vision
Of the prism of light but still blind
Because you lack the inner every sinner
Will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
Throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
You cry out your words fly out and sounds die out
You remain unheard sufferin eternally internal external
Along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
Releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
And permanently upon this journey
Through the journal of the book of life
Those who took a life without justice
Will become just ice ice ice
Its been taught that your worst enemy couldnt harm you
As much as your own wicked thoughts
What devils fought we wrought and lets annoint
Now youre bein persecuted by that universal court court court
Iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
With rose petals and jasmine as men use talismans
Burn some incense chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
Im convinced Allah is God always has been always will be
You could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be
Ninetythree million miles away from the sun
Til you realize you and the sun is one like the knowledge
Know the ledge to where your heart is
Or fall off into the internal hell thats uncharted
Light travels at the rate of 186000 miles per second
Through time and space until it reach a target
And once were freed of darkness and show em where the path
From which the Red Sea was parted into these straight
At the narrow gate but wide is the road to destruction and hate
What you thought life was a sport A game
One hundred years short know the soul is immortal
Walk through many portals and those who go astray
Will pay a judgment day and these few years of wicked bullshit
Aint worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
With dragons and snakes and any pain you can imaginate
Instead I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
Of life and fed God Degree of light to my head
Its been said the fool who sleep is already dead so I stay awake
And take care of my brother and uncover reveal the skin
So we can see each other cause every color
That makes the light appear duller whos the colored man
Whos the original whos the biochemical
Whos the grafted digital digital digital digital
Digital yo yo yo yo yo

Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
While niggas minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
The sea of reality they cant inhale deep devils have em
Stagnant a trapping the 45 magnum
And shatter bone fragments
Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet
Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
Liftin weights readin ancient tablets back on the block nobodys havin it
Those who havent learnt get returned
You freaky ass niggas get burned
Some walk around like they aint concerned
With the hell goin on inside the world
Why do grown men molest little girls
Is it because the girls breast has swelled
To the size of a woman although shes twelve
The whole world is sick sick sick
Trapped up in six six six
I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
Tryin to carry on wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon
A vagabond tryin to steal sportswear from Paragon
Goin in circles like a ferris wheel
Undernourished meals I cherish hope drown inside the sea of life
Use my third eye for a periscope and take flight to the edge of night
To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
You couldnt see a spark of light
While others play ball I recall me and GZA Dirty
Hangin in halls bangin on walls
Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue
Kept razorblade between the jaws breakin all laws
Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
To wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
To funnel the PFunk smokin woolie blunts
Dust cocktails and primos shot more dice than casinos
Back when WuGambinos were called FOI MCs
All and Together Now Crew BCC
REC Posse GP DMD
Ol Dirty stalked East New York GZA maintained Franklin Lane
I was going to Thomas the Jeff where students got slain
Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis
Took share time in Marquis UGod general contractin service
While Meth Chef and Deck was off the New Dorp
For white boys who took steroids
Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
Back when our girlfriends was virgins
Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Murry Bergtraum
A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving
These young Gods was seekin
Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Barton and Medina
Girls who sung like Sarafina
On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her
As if I dreamed her
I was dead broke now I will use key notes to make Gnotes
So its always hope
See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
To the heart of Medina but Shaolin is the brain
So take heed to these words
And feel the power of the Sunshower

Approachin the final hour
Power equality Allah Cees everything
Lets come together under the wings
And take flight WuTang the saga Rzarecta
In your sector

The Fuck
Its just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back just flow
Thats how we doin it

Bound by honest sword take over the set rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the tech crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamills wife fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew my pen sterile wont perform if Im not lampable
Askin my manll get you slapped down play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it thats the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air long dick it we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve guess who rip it

Quick get on your knees with yo sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole think I can fit three
Your pink lips spread it in shit let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Pingpong pussy wide world of wombs titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that its
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY farts breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Allmighty dick ran in with a cape some call him engine
Lightning rod bob black candy cane attatched to God
Thick like a great adventure cigar in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit

Plus beef I hone the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS Im shakin in my bones
