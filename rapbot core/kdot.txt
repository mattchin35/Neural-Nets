Intro
Gather round Im glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner

Listen Keisha Tammy come up front

Chorus
Now I dont give a fuck if you

Kendrick Lamar
Fire burning inside my eyes this the music that saved my life
Yall be calling it Hip Hop I be calling it Hypnotize
Yeah Hypnotize trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for Aint nobody gon win that war
My details be retail man I got so much in store
Racism is still alive yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that nigga look at that line its so diverse
They getting off work and that wanna see Kendrick
Everybody cant drive Benzs and I been there so I make it my business
to give em my full attention tenhut man I gotta get my wind up
Man I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up oooh
Matter of fact dont mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit had a microphone I tossed it
Had a brain then I lost it Im out of my mind
So dont you mind how much the cost it penny for my thoughts
Everybody please hold up your wallets

Thats starstruck and roast you oh my HiiiPoWeR

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Im tired of yall cause everybody lied to yall
Do you believe it Recognize them false achievements
Its treason and Im Tylenol I knock out when you knock it off
Knock of the doors of opportunity Im too involved

Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically Im UFC
If a UFO had came for me Ima come back with the head of alien
Dont alienate my dreams get it right get a life

Put wings on my back that a plane or angel Both

Song   Hol Up

Kendrick Lamar
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
theyll probably think Im a terrorist
Eat my asparagus then Im asking her
Thoughts of a young nigga fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds I know you dying to meet em
Ill probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches twenty million and a Comptown fitted

Chorus
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Yeah big shit popping Section 80

Kendrick Lamar
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off I call a bitch a bitch
A hoe a hoe a woman a woman I never did nothing
but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that Im easily peddling
with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults Im too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old the wiser man
Truth be told Im like 87
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance dont know which one is a Christian damn
Who can I trust in 2012 Theres no one not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help somebody

Chorus
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Yeah big shit popping everybody watching
When you do it like this nigga losing aint an option
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Hol up hol up hol up hol up
Yeah big shit popping
Ay ay kick her out the studio Ali

Kendrick Lamar
Twentyfour seven nigga working his ass for it she popping that ass for it
The King of Diamonds with diamonds I never do ask for
They checking my passport Im too accustomed with customs
She call in the task force I killed it somebody cuff him
They want me fastforward the game and why you complain

When you pushing a RAV4 you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport her feet on the dashboard

Chorus
Hol up hol up hol up hol up

Song   ADHD

Kendrick Lamar
Uhuh fuck that

Chorus
Eight doobies to the face fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case nigga fuck that
Two pills and a half wait nigga fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age dont exist

Kendrick Lamar
Man I swear my nigga tripping off that shit again pick him up then I set him in
Cold water then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feeling that he feel today
You know when youre part of Section 8 and you feel like no one can relate
cause you are you are a loner loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger stronger
Im in the house party tripping off my generation sipping cough
syrup like its water never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
that the world is bout to end who gives a fuck We never do listen
unless it comes with an 808 a melody and some hoes
PlayStation and some drank technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see is a big crowd thats product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebels dream
Yep her president is black she black too
Purple label on her back but that dap
is like when she take it straight to the head then she look at me
She got ADHD

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Like whoaoh whoa
Whoaoh whoa I dont got a limit just give me some more with it
Whoaoh whoa I dont got a limit just give me some more with it
Whoaoh whoa They always told me ADHD did it
Whoaoh

And then she started
And then she started feeling herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon how I rap baby how old are you
She say twentytwo I say twentythree ok then we all crack babies
Damn why you say that She said where my drink at
Ima tell you later just tell your neighbors have the police relax
I stood up shut the blinds closed the screen JumboTron
Made to the back where she reside then she said read between the lines
Yep hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she might just open up when the new flow start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now
Its nothing we can do now somebody walked in with a pound
of that Bay Area kush she looked at me then looked
at it then she grabbed it then she said get it understood
You know why we crack babies because we born in the eighties
That ADHD crazy

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Like whoaoh whoa
Whoaoh whoa I dont got a limit just give me some more with it
Whoaoh whoa I dont got a limit just give me some more with it
Whoaoh whoa They always told me ADHD did it
Whoaoh

Kendrick Lamar
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on It was early in the morn
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction Ive outgrown
Damn girl why so much
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Dont you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
Its the beauty in her but when the makeup occur
I dont see it all I see is a blur

Chorus

He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
 My complexion in a direction Ive outgrown
I feel like its not enough
 I can never put on too much makeup
 Yeah I know your imperfections I be constantly stressing
 From him is where I get it from
 They tell me I need to smile at least once in a while
 I hate my lips my nose my eyebrows
Its the beauty in me but what he dont see
 is that I had a black eye beep
To be continued eleven

Were far from good not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
with the top down screaming we dont give a fuck
Drink my forty ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
cause the kids just aint alright

Oh shit nigga something bout to happen
Nigga this shit nigga this sound like thirty kis under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs dont smell it

Kendrick Lamar
Welcome to vigilante eighties so dont you ask me
Im hungry my bodys antsy I rip through your fucking pantry
Peeling off like a Xanny examine my orchestra
Granny said when Im old enough Ill be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby washed up
Pussy fix your panties Im Mr Marcus you getting fucked uh
You aint heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain Vicodins couldnt ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained to go against Dracula
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like its the 90s
Bullet to your temple youre homicidal remind me that

Chorus Kendrick Lamar  RZA
Compton Crip niggas aint nothing to fuck with

Lets hit the county building gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a fortyounce to the neck
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down get a sixfour better know how to drive it
Im driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racing racing past Johnny because hes racist
1987 the children on Ronald Reagan
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch
Im really out here nigga You blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress
Like really out here He copping some blow hoping that he can stretch
Newborn massacre hopping out the passenger
with calendars cause your day coming
Run him down and then he gun him down Im hoping that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson dont mean nothing because

Kendrick Lamar
I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing my daddy tired
I need me a weapon these niggas ride
every minute hour and second ministers tried
to save me how Im gon listen when I dont even hear God
Heaven or Hell base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son stare at the sun
and youll be looking in my eyes homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway this for my niggas
Uncles twentythree hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that Im so determined to blow
that you hear the music I wrote hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A MetroPC phone then you went back in
So when I touch the pen the pen is in my view
Ima get it right just so you

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
Smoke good eat good live good 5X

And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police they gon have to come and get me

Kendrick Lamar
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
Id like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
Im twentythree with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich but wealthy theres nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful the city got my back
Before that I give them my torso
You think about it and dont call me lyrical
cause really Im just a nigga thats evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So wont you bare witness while I bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On Wanna Be Heard probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio he aint know
I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it hell probably be
out of work laid back while he

Chorus Kendrick Lamar

Exercise your ism and dont depend on no one else

Chorus Ashtro Bot
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Kendrick Lamar
Uh and Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr Shakur thats her favorite rapper
Bumping Brendas Got a Baby while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking she start running
like FloJo dont care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough dont see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy but she dont know her father thats ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
And Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is Gods temple
and its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
Shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen whats between her thighs hed compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
It was a block away from Lueders Park I seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
And Lord knows shes beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized shell never escape the allure
of the black man white man needing satisfaction
At first it became a practice but now shes numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners redemption
That sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing
through that block away from Lueders Park I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder left her dead raped in the street

And this is rigamortis

You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
Im on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin
and then I end on cloud nine
And thats important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
And dont be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And Ima be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and a tie is suitable
and usual its suicide
CSI just might investigate
this fucking parasite

He dead
Amen

Thats what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Feragami so many
and cool enough for the seventies
Nigga paybacks a bitch
and bitch you been living in debt with me
That Im more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
to say he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling thats irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldnt think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
Its just me Jay Rock Soul and Q
So the system aint why we cute
Nothing else you can do

Chorus 2

I rapped him and made him Casper

Ill pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners
Wont you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
and its casually done
And tell em my salary come
in lumps of a hundreds
Dont talk to me bout no money
The sun is under my feet
and I come in peace to compete
I dont run if youd rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest street
and I get busy on many emcees
Really ballistic anybody can see
Any assistance everybody done see
some persistence recognize I be
really too vicious the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets
Better partition better dot you T
and I gon mention how the fog you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
and Im charged up and the catastrophe
is starstruck and the audacity
of yall fucks never could hassle me
and yall luck just ran out youll see

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
It go one two three
Two in the front one in the back seat seat
Seat seat looking for a victim of an AK47
Hundred round each each each
But why must we retaliate Is it human nature
I dont know I look for the answers later
Make a right there they go sometimes gotta

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
Im dying inside I wonder if Zion inside the Heavens
A condom a rollie pain a fat blunt and a MAC11
Thats all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But Im right on the edge on Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinners advice
Well its probably you am I right If Im wrong you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling its so appealing to pray
I wonder if Im just a villain dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me dont worry bout it
I give em back they deposit no money just total silence
Im running they say Im wildin a youngun with lack of guidance
Theres hundreds of us with problems more money more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an outofcontrol artist thats dealing with life the hardest
Thats on my life but regardless Ima

Chorus

BJ the Chicago Kid
Yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure I lost one of my biggest believers ohh
Close deaths make you think about your life
like if I had the same chance twice what would I do different
Id tell her I loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when Im done recording swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in Heaven saying they at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Dont take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord what kind of life is this
Mama I just wanna sing
Mama said according to get everything
you gotta risk everything
So Im smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians

Whats your life about Enlighten me
Is you gon live on your knees or die on your feet
Theres fire in the street fire in my swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
Ive never seen a crop circle
but Ive cops circle the block I puff squares
But I swear one day Ima stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams Uncle Sam aint no killing me
One two three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch fuck the penitentiary

Section 80s babies blame Ronald Reagan

The homie got wet so we tryna soak it in
The president is black but you cant vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify the people they gon peep it universally
We might not change the world but we gon manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot wont you let these cats know
We knew wed be here like back in 04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist em
Were not victors were victims
The bigger picture isnt developed yet
Like what if kids were celibate
Or what is Tammy came across a real man
who didnt play games like children
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriends girlfriend let the world end
And everybody tripping off twentytwelve
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
Odd Futures aight but our futures not
That martial law shit drop we gon all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fastfood use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public work your lil ninetofive
Dont forget to pay your tithes and thank God you alive HiiiPoWeR
And on another note
we focussed like the Hubble Telescope Soul

See a lot of yall dont understand Kendrick Lamar
because you wonder how I could talk about money hoes clothes God and history
all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common
Only half of the truth if you tell it
See I spent twentythree years on this earth searching for answers
till one day I realised I had to come up with my own
Im not on the outside looking in Im not on inside looking out
Im in the dead fucking centre looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
Thats an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money hoes clothes God and history
all in the same sentence
just know I meant it and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
Im not the next pop star Im not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation

A generation of bliss and disobedience
No they cant control us no they cant control you
No they cant control us but we control each other
We build our own world
If you dont leave with nothing else tonight you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
or our family
Heart honor and represent

Kendrick Lamar
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80 HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
Im falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengetis clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like its a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig Charlottes Web is gonna miss you
My issue isnt televised and you aint gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat because our lifes an instrumental
This is physical and mental I wont sugarcoat it
Youd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I dont want no plastic nation dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs

Chorus
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Fivestar dishes food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You cant resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Kendrick Lamar
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama I cant turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widows peak uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak uhh
Them demons got me I aint prayed in some weeks uhh
Dear Lord come save me the Devils working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane I need a license
to kill Im standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids write your own hieroglyphs

Chorus
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR

I mean the shit is Bobby Seale making meals
You cant resist his HiiiPoWeR

Every day we fight the system
just to make our way we been down for too long

Never liked the system
We been down for too long
But thats alright nananah

Kendrick Lamar
Who said a black man in Illuminati
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once Im on that pedestal
Frightening so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill dont sing or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said Bang the drama it bring
is crazy product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water thats why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me lets set it off
Cause a riot throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids write our own hieroglyphs

Chorus
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR

Intro
Lord God I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life and be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus name Amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians push an 04 MercedesBenz
Hello my name is Kendrick she said No youre handsome
Whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancin
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin shades now cool
Where you stay She said Down the street from Dominguez High
Okay I know thats borderline Compton or Paramount Well is it Compton
No she replied and quickly start battin her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful What you tryna get into
She didnt tell just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now Im likin her
Conversation we having probably enticin her
Who could imagine Maybe my actions would end up wifin her
Love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us
Its deep rooted the music of bein young and dumb
Its never muted in fact its much louder where Im from
We know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetriuss irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin a nut
I wanna come over whats up Thats what I told her 
soon as this episode of Martin go off Im tryin to get off
I was in heat like a cactus my tactics of bein thirsty
Probably could hurt me but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my mommas keys hopped in the car then oh boy
So now Im down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin Alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
Im thinkin bout that sex  thinkin bout her thighs 
or maybe kissin on her neck or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin up my texts
I looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse
And Im a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
Im hopin to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
Im two blocks away 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay she wavin me cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face and then I see
Two niggas two black hoodies I froze as my phone rang

Chorus
I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me Lord forgive me  things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my VIBE bitch dont kill my vibe

Kendrick Lamar
Uh look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous I can say that I like a challenge 
and you to me is painless you dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge even a small lighter can burn a bridge

Interlude
I can feel the changes I can feel the new people around me 
just want to be famous you can see that my city found me 
then put me on stages to me thats amazing
To you thats a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
Youre trying to keep it deprived and only cosign what radio does
And Im looking right past you we live in a world we live in a world 
on two different axles you live in a world you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to this shit is vital I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain rather a seasonal name Ill let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Imma break out and then hide every lock Imma break out and then hide every lock

Interlude  Chorus

Outro
Bitch dont kill my vibe you aint heard a chorus 
like this in a long time  dont you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings hide your feelings now what you better do
Ill take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream its alive
My New Years resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe bitch dont kill my vibe

Song   The Art of Peer Pressure

Kendrick Lamar
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the Federales will roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
I hope the universe love you today
cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate if its necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know you think its an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
of the working world we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth usually Im drugfree
But shit Im with the homies

Yeah nigga we off of pill and Remy Red
 Come through and bust ya head nigga
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
 where my niggas pour up fo and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my motherfucking niggas
 Hop out do my stuff then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact I hope out that motherfucker
 and be like dodododo Dododododo

Its 230 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
Ill tell you to suck my dick then Ill continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the lightskinned girls in all their little dresses good Lord
They knew we werent from round there
cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions the perfect combination
Before we sparked the conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didnt like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger
I mean I never was stranger to the folk neither I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
Thats ironic cause Ive never been violent
until Im with the homies

Just riding just riding
Me and the homies
Bullshitting acting a fool
Me and the homies
Tripping really tripping
Me and the homies
Just riding just riding just riding

Bragging bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didnt make me feel that bad
Im usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up beefing if we aint got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still nigga what is you saying
Pull in front of the house that weve been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right then made a left then made a right
Then made a left we was just circling life
My mama called kicking it
I should have told her Im probably bout to catch my first offense
with the homies

police sirens ring

But they made a right then made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure
Me and the homies
This is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure
Me and the homies
And this is the art of peer pressure
 This is the art of peer pressure

This is the art of peer pressure

The only thing we had to free our mind free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs see dollar signs
You lookin like an easy come up ya bish ya bish

And thats a lifestyle that we never knew we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

Chorus One Kendrick Lamar  Anna Wise

Pick your poison tell me what you doing

Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and thats just how I feel

Chorus Two Kendrick Lamar  Anna Wise
Nah nah a dollar might just fuck your main bitch thats just how I feel

Santa Claus dont miss them stockings liquor spillin pistols poppin
Bakin soda yola whippin aint no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue everyday Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do when you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut them serpents lurkin blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs but its all good
Broken promises steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree

Every second every minute man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high hands up high hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now put me in the mood
Im talking bout dark room perfume
Go go

Kendrick Lamar
I recognize your fragrance hol up
You aint never gotta say shit woo
And I know your taste is
A little bit mmm high maintenance ooh
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Yall curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party She wanna go and party
Nigga dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga that aint good game homie sorry
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
less I write it down for real PS

Chorus 2X Kendrick Lamar
You can get it you can get it
You can get it you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want Poetic Justice put it in a song

Drake
I really hope you play this
Cause ol girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
Youve been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It dont make sense
Young East African Girl you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its all right here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doing that walk for
When I see that thing move I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
PS

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talking poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb Its you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb Its you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve I want that interference
Its coherent I can hear it mmhmm
Thats your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me mmhmm
Breathe slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely yours truly
And right before you go blind

Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby

Kendrick Lamar
Look inside these walls and you see them havin withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you Im tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that Im easily prey I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building its probably big as a building
Me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
But what am I supposed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that I aint but know Im accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place they was wonderin if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I dont mind because one day youll respect the good kid mAAd city

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
All I see is strobe lights blinding me in my hindsight
Findin me by myself promise me you can help 
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standin still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask Lift up your shirt cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter Hes probably young but I know that hes down
Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
He dont mind he know well never respect the good kid mAAd city

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
All I see in this room 20 Xanies and these shrooms
Grownup candy for pain can we live in a sane society
Its entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20 Xanies and shrooms
Some grownup candy I lost it I feel its nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid mAAd city

If Pirus and Crips all got along 
Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time Im in the street I hear YAWK YAWK YAWK YAWK

Chorus
Man down where you from nigga
Fuck who you know where you from my nigga
Where your grandma stay huh my nigga
This mAAd city I run my nigga

Kendrick Lamar
Brace yourself Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is culdesac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was Me LBoogs and YanYan YG Lucky ridin down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin your hand out the window check yo self
Uh warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow dance 
with society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where censored hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time with the slidin door fuck is up
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
Pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch a wall of bullets comin from
AKs ARs Aye yall duck
Thats what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man goddamn all Hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in 94 fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose you wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty just pieces BGs up to preapprove
Bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess

Kendrick Lamar
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the livin room in my mommas pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still wont ever know my life
Kendrick aka Comptons human sacrifice

Interlude MC Eiht

MC Eiht
Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drivebys in the hood lately
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip we in the hood still
So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a motherfucker stand

Kendrick Lamar
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16 would you believe me
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some Now  Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip the Children of the Corn they vandalizin
The option of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive hit the powder 
Then watch this flame that arrive in his eye this a coward
The concept is aim and they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton USA made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what

Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank

Kendrick Lamar
Now I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
I was in a dark room loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
that Ima get fucked up filling up my cup I see the crowd move
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

Chorus
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots
Ima show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor Ima dive in it
Pour up drank head shot drank
Sit down drank stand up drank
Pass out drank wake up drank
Faded drank faded drank

Kendrick Lamar
OK now open your mind up and listen me Kendrick
 I am your conscience if you do not hear me then you will be history Kendrick
 I know that youre nauseous right now and Im hoping to lead you to victory Kendrick
If I take another one down Ima drown in some poison abusing my limit
I think that Im feeling the vibe I see the love in her eyes
I see the feeling the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize this is parental advice then apparently
Im overinfluenced by what you are doing I thought I was doing the most then someone said to me

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
When the lights shut off and its my turn

Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Kendrick Lamar
I woke up this morning and figured Id call you
In case Im not here tomorrow Im hopin that I can borrow
a peace of mind Im behind on whats really important
My mind is really distorted I find nothin but trouble in my life
Im fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive
Everybodys a victim in my eyes
When I ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering Get em
I got em and I aint give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngn in pajamas and Duntaduns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child Im proud and well devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever Ima push it wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope three gunshots

Chorus  minus first two lines

Kendrick Lamar
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section80 the message resembled Brendas Got a Baby
Whats crazy was I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judgin her past and shit
Well its completely my future her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit
And Ima need that 40 dollars
Even if I gotta fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park Im followed by a married man a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with Es
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes I run away and never do miss em
See my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet a leader you need her to learn something
Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught
Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed
And Im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
My sister died in vain but what point are you tryin to gain
If you cant fit the pumps I walk in Ill wait
 Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song
Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great
A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get or die tryin
Im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin
fading You lyin to these motherfuckers talkin about you can help em
With my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
Dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga this bullshit

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away It its today I hope I hear a
cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots
And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of wonderin when Ima rest
And youre right your brother was a brother to me
And your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the TV screen
By any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between
Her personal life I was like It need to be told
Cursin the life of 20 generations after her soul
Exactly whatd happen if I aint continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
Fightin for your rights even when youre wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when Im gone
Now am I worth it 
Did I put enough work in 

Chorus  minus first two lines

Promise that youll sing about me forever
Promise that youll sing about me for ooohhh

I say what I wanna say when I feel
and I look in the mirror and know Im there
With my hands in the air Im proud to say yeah
Im real Im real Im really really real 4X

Kendrick Lamar
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him you love them you love her
You love so much you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold with the sequin
You love handbag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold thats green I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you cant see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks youll still say youre lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women you love keepin control
Of everything that you love you love beef
You love streets you love runnin duckin police
You love your hood might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes cant you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A dont come free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word but but what if I got love
I love them I love when I love her
I love so much I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause youre the girl I attract
I love second verse cause youre the homie that packed
Burner like a stove top that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact I love it so much I dont love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I dont love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that Im season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility Im talkin about
Hatin all money power respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real

Kendricks father
Kenny I aint trippin off that Dominos anymore just calling 
Sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy but dont learn the hard way like I did homie

Oh and Top Dawg called the house too 
I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio 
But look you take this music business serious and put out something me and your dad can step to 
Shit you know we from Chicago you know thats what we do

Interlude Anna Wise

If I dont hear from you by tomorrow I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes 
Come back a man tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton
Let em know you was just like them
but you still rose from that dark place of violence becoming a positive person 
But when you do make it give back with your words of encouragement
and thats the best way to give back 
To your city and I love you Kendrick

Married to the game and a bad bitch chose

Straight from the CIA set it on my lap
Take a few M16s to the hood

Kept me up watchin pornos in poverty  apology No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate like myself

When you got the yams whats the yams

Kendrick Lamar  Anna Wise
 The yam is the power that be echoes
 You can smell it when Im walkin down the street
Oh yes we can oh yes we can I can dig rappin
 But a rapper with a ghostwriter what the fuck happened
Oh no  I swore I wouldnt tell
But most of yall share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a twoman cell a twoman cell
Somethins in the water somethins in the water
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then Id rather be a bum than a motherfuckin baller

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
 The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor echoes
 Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
 247 365 days times two
I was contemplatin gettin on stage
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say

Chorus  minus last bar line

You goatmouthed mammyfucker

Kendrick Lamar
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybodys suicidal they dont even need my help
This shit is elementary Ill probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city everybodys screamin Compton
I should probably run for mayor when Im done to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin out the court buildin woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past twentyfive and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life aint shit but a fat vagina
Screamin Annie are you okay Annie are you okay
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin king

Bitch where was you when I was gunshot
By the time you hear the next pop the funk shall be within you
gunshot Now I run the game got the whole world talkin
King Kunta  everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta  black man takin no losses aw yeah
Bitch where was you when I was walkin
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin
King Kunta  everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Outro Anna Wise
Funk funk funk funk funk funk
We want the funk We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk you gon take it

Intro Kendrick Lamar
What money got to do with it
when I dont know the full definition of a rap image
Im trapped inside the ghetto and I aint proud to admit it
Institutionalized I keep runnin back for a visit
Hol up get it back
I said Im trapped inside the ghetto and I aint proud to admit it
Institutionalized I can still kill me a nigga so what

Interlude Anna Wise and Bilal
If I was the president

Kendrick Lamar
Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo somethin for somethin thats the obvious
Oh shit flows so sick dont you swallow it
Bitin my style youre salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up never lactoseintolerant
The last remainder of real shit you know the obvious
Me scholarship No streets put me through colleges
BE all you can be true but the problem is
A dreams only a dream if work dont follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
Ill tell you my hypothesis Im prolly just way too loyal
KDizzle would do it for you my niggaz think Im a god
Truthfully all of em spoiled usually youre never charged
But somethin came over you once I took you to them fuckin BET Awards
You lookin at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of em
Somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
I shoulda listened what my grandmomma said to me

Chorus Bilal
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass Boooy
Shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
Oh now slow down

Snoop Dogg
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
He was fivefoot somethin God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said

Kendrick Lamar
Fuck am I sposed to do when Im lookin at walkin licks
The constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
The private jets and passports presidential glass floor
Gold bottles gold models stiffen up the ass for
Instagram flicks suckin dick fuck is this
One more suck away from wavin flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him quickly because he got it
Its the recession then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds
No more livin poor meet my 44
When I see em put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick know they your coworkers
But its gon take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see Im on the clock once that watch landin in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor
Well thats me at these awards I guess my grandmomma was warnin a boy she said

Chorus

Outro Snoop Dogg
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
He was fivefoot somethin dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you cant
take the hood out the homie took his show money
Stashed it in the mozeywozey Hollywoods nervous
Fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service

I remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same

Song   These Walls

woman moaning and groaning

If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 If these walls could talk
 IF THESE WALLS COULD TALLLLK Sex

Anna Wise
She just want to close her eyes and sway
If you if you if you
Exercise your right to work it out
Its true its true its true
Shout out to the birthday girls say hey hey Say hey hey
Aw girl Everyone deserves a night to play play
She plays  only when you tell her no

Chorus Anna Wise Bilal
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reignrain when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when Im in it I love it when Im in it ohh Ohh

Kendrick Lamar
If these walls can talk theyd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket Im not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall tellin me they full of pain resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me Im just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable exclamation
Interior pink color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when Im here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might CRUSH

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
If these walls can talk theyd tell me to go deep
Yellin at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down thats my religion
Walls feelin like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I dont know how long I can wait in these walls
Ive been on these streets too long
Lookin at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ I mustve missed them
Im not involved Id rather diss them
Id rather call on you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon CRUSH

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
If your walls can talk theyd tell you its too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash em on the yard
Take the recipe the Bible and God
Wall tellin you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin no callin CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say youre reputable not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bulllike  a killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin the warden would afford them
THAT SENTENCE SO IMPORTANT
Walls tellin you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusin my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin on a famous rapper
WALLS CAN TALK TALK echoes

I remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
 Sometimes I did the same abusing my power full of resentment
 Resentment that turned into a deep depression
 Found myself screaming in a hotel room

I place blame on you still place shame on you still
Feel like you aint shit feel like you dont feel
confidence in yourself breakin on marble floors
Watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that Im yours
But you aint shit Im convinced your tolerance nothin special
What can I blame you for Nigga I can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
A baby inside just a teenager wheres your patience
Wheres your antennas where is the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100000 but never reached her
I fuckin tell you you fuckin failure YOU AINT NO LEADER
I never liked you forever despise you I DONT NEED YOU
The world dont need you dont let them deceive you
Numbers lie too fuck your pride too thats for dedication
Thought money would change you made you more complacent
I fuckin hate you I hope you embrace it I swear

Kendrick Lamar  in drunk cracky voice
Are you the reason why momma and nem leavin
No you aint shit you say you love em I know you dont mean it
I know youre irresponsible selfish in denial cant help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden everyone felt it
Everyone heard it multiple shots corners cryin out
You was deserted where was your antennas again
Where was yo presence where was yo support that you pretend
You aint no brother you aint no disciple you aint no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Lil brother you promised youd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas On the road bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time thats unforgiven
You even Facetimed instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover well
Third surgery they couldnt stop the bleeding for real
Then he died God himself will say You fuckin failed You aint try

sniffling

I know yo secrets nigga mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin on yo heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys aint been speakin nigga
Yall damn near beefin I seen it and youre the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk deep swig
I cry myself to sleep bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin to pieces earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know yo secrets dont let me tell them to the world
about that shit you thinkin and that time you swig Im bout to hurl
Im fucked up but I aint as fucked up as you
You just cant get right I think yo heart made of bulletproof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda felt that black Revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say You GOTTA go
And if I told your secrets the worldll know money cant stop a suicidal weakness

 Kendrick Lucy dont slack a minute Lucy work harder
 Lucy gon call ya even when Lucy know you love your Father
 Im Lucy I loosely heard prayers on your first album
 Truly Lucy dont mind cause at the end of the day youll pursue me

Like a Chevy in quicksand Yeah that sloppy

So it seeeeeeeeems

Kendrick Lamar
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap West West West
We dont share the same synonym fall back West West West
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimickin radios nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
Visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
Gamblin Benjamin benefits sinnin in traffic
Spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
Winnin in every decision Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isnt it lovely how menaces turned attraction
Pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writin blue magic
Thank God for rap I would say it got me a plaque
But whats better than that The fact it brought me back home

Chorus
We been waitin for you Waitin for you
Waitin for you waitin for you

Kendrick Lamar
I know everything I know everything know myself
I know morality spirituality good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you I know everything
I know Compton I know street shit I know shit thats conscious
I know everything I know lawyers advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom I know bad religion I know good karma
I know everything I know history I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isnt meant for me
I know everything I know cars clothes hoes and money
I know loyalty I know respect I know those thats ornery
I know everything the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if Im generous at heart I dont need recognition
The way Im rewarded well thats Gods decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids dont gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life Im knowin how much its worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didnt know shit the day I came home

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro gap in his smile
Handmedown sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin new laws momma passed on home trainin
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
 You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 Oh I forgot Dont Kill My Vibe thats right youre famous
 I used to watch on Channel 5 TV was taken
 But never mind youre here right now dont you mistake it
 Its just a new trip take a glimpse at your familys ancestor
 Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
 And that was bullshit I mean your life is full of turmoil
 You spoiled by fantasies of who you are I feel bad for you
 I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
 If you resist Ill back off quick go catch a flight or two
 But if you pick destiny over rest in peace
 Then be an advocate tell your homies especially to come back home

beat stops then changes

Tell me somethin think Im losin my mind ha
I say where you at from the front to the back
Im lookin for you I react only when you react
Ha I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the 38 special
Maybe youre in a dollar bill maybe youre not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel song starts to fade
Maybe Im paranoid ha maybe I dont need you anyway

Kendrick Lamar
I dont give a fuck about no politics in rap my nigga

FUCK what they talkin bout yo shit is where its at my nigga
Came in this game you stuck yo fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game yo hood yo name in this game
Now you double up time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin to the scripts now hip them Benjamins gon cuddle up
Skip  hop  drip  drop
Flip  flop with the white tube sock
It goes Sherrrrm Sticks burrrrrrn this
Thats what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute out the Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos Monte Carlos Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz PFunkers Mexicans they FUCK with you
Asians they FUCK with you nobody cant FUCK with you

Chorus

Hopped out the Caddy just got my dick sucked
The little homies called they said The enemies done cliqued up
Oh YEAH Puto want to squabble with mi barrio
Oh YEAH Tell em they can run it for the cardio
Oh YEAH Everything is everything its scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin scramblin football numbers slanderin
Niggaz name on paper you snitched all summer
Streets dont fail me now
They tell me its a new gang in town
From Compton  to Congress set trippin all around
Aint nothin new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state which one you governin
They give us guns and drugs call us thugs make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you Obama say What it Do
OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO OBAMA SAY WHAT IT DO

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Everybody wanna talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack or who white and who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hiphop was rappin
Motherfucker if you did then Killer Miked be platinum
Yall priorities fucked up put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic my memory been gone since
Dont ask about no camera blockin at award shows
No dont ask about my bitch no dont ask about my foes
Less you askin me about power yeah I got a lot of it
Im the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby K Dot what up I heard they opened up
 Pandoras box I box em all in by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sittin down with Jay
He said Its funny how one verse could fuck up the game

Outro
I been A1 since day one you niggaz booboo

I remembered you was conflicted misusing your influence
  Sometimes I did the same abusing my power full of resentment
  Resentment that turned into a deep depression
  Found myself screamin in the hotel room
  I didnt wanna selfdestruct the evils of Lucy was all around me
  So I went runnin for answers until I came home
  But that didnt stop survivors guilt
  Going back and forth trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
  Or maybe how A1 my foundation was
  But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city
  I was entering a new one

Song   How Much a Dollar Cost

Kendrick Lamar
How much a dollar really cost
The question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling yall
Gotta see how Im chillin once I park this luxury car
Hoppin out feeling big as Mutombo twenty on pump six dirty
Marcellus called me Dumbo twenty years ago cant forget
Now I can lend em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold the liberal concept that what menll do
Twentyohsix he didnt hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu my American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station a homeless man with a semitan complexion
Asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land
Deep water powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted I knew he was smokin
He begged and pleaded asked me to feed him twice I didnt believe it
Told him Beat it contributin money just for his pipe I couldnt see it
He said My son temptation is one thing that Ive defeated
Listen to me I want a single bill from you  nothin less nothin more
I told him I aint have it then closed my door tell me how much a dollar cost

Chorus James Fauntleroy
All you neeeeed is more to feed your mind
Water sun and love the one you love
All you need the air you breathe

Kendrick Lamar
Hes starin at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin hes starin at me I grab my key
Hes starin at me I started the car then I tried to leave
And somethin told me to keep it in park until I can see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like Im the reason hes homeless and askin ME for a favor
Hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
Hes starin at me I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now Im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck
I never understood someone beggin for goods
Askin for handouts takin it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14
 A humble man is all that we ever need tell me how much a dollar cost

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Guilt trippin and feelin resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
Sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
I should distance myself I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here who the fuck Im kiddin
So Ima tell you like I told the last bum crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines and I recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
I got better judgment I know when niggaz hustlin
Keep in mind when I was strugglin I did compromise
Now I comprehend I smell grandpas old medicine
reekin from your skin moonshine and gin
Nigga youre babblin your words aint flatterin Im imaginin
Denzel but lookin at ONeal Kazaam your sad thrills
Your gimmick is mediocre the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin focus
And Im insensitive and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said Your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said Every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said Know the truth itll set you free
 Youre lookin at the Messiah the son of Jehovah the higher power
 The choir that spoke the word the Holy Spirit the nerve
 Of Nazareth and Ill tell you just how much a dollar cost
 The price of having a spot in Heaven embrace your loss I am God

Outro Ronald Isley
I wash my hands I said my grace
What more do you want from me
Tears of a clown guess Im not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone oh yeah

I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
You know Id go the distance you know Im ten toes down
Even if massa listenin I got the worlds attention
So Imma say somethin thats vital and critical for survival
of mankind if he lyin color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces then wit told me
A woman is woman love the creation
It all came from God then you was my confirmation I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with

Chorus

Interlude
You like it I love it 8X

WooWOOWOOWOOWOO

Where the homegirl Rapsody at
 I need you to speak yo mind real quick loved one

Rapsody
Let me talk my Stu Scott scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep Your Head Up when did you stop loving thy
color of your skin color of your eyes
Thats the real Blues baby like you met Jays baby
Uh you blew me away
You think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my solemn men up north 12 Years a Slave
12 years of age thinkin my shade too dark
I love myself I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light dont mean you smart bein dark dont make you stupid
And frame of mind for them Bustas aint talkin WOOHAH
Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored
Like two ties LL you lose two times
If you dont see youre beautiful in your complexion
It aint complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite uh thats the context
Yeah baby Im conscious aint no contest
If you like it I love it all your earth tones been blessed
Aint no stress jiggaboos wanna be
I aint talkin Jay mmmmm I aint talkin B
Im talkin Daze we got School watchin movie screens
And Spike your self esteem the new James Bond gon be black as me
Black as brown hazelnut cinnamon black tea
And its all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team blues and pirus no colors aint a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
 Teenage gun toters that dont play fair should I get out the car
 I dont see Compton I see something much worse
 The land of the landmines the hell thats on earth

Intro
Everything black I dont want black
I dont like erything black aint need black
Some white some black I aint want black
I hate erything black black
Ohh now we black I dont need black
I dont like erything black I dont need black
Ill die we black I aint on black

Kendrick Lamar  singing
Six in the morn fire in the street
Burn baby burn thats all I wan see
And sometimes I get off watchin you die in vain
Its such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin
But homie you made me
Black dont crack my nigga
My nigga my nigga my nigga my nigga
My nigga my nigga my nigga my nigga

Kendrick Lamar
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin this way since I was 16 came to my senses
You never liked us anyway fuck your friendship I meant it
Im AfricanAmerican
Im African Im black as the moon heritage of a small village pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
You hate me dont you You hate my people
Your plan is to terminate my culture youre fuckin evil
I want you to recognize that Im a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but cant take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
Im guardin my feelings  I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community makin a killin
You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

Interlude
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry the bigger I shoot

Chorus Assassin
I said they treat me like a slave cah me black
Woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah we black
And man a say they put me in a chain cah we black
Imagine now big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip Left scars pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon the block
All dem a say we doomed from the start cah we black
Remember this every race start from the Black
Just remember that

Kendrick Lamar
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean its evident that Im irrelevant to society
Thats what youre tellin me penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me til Im dead
Church me with your fake prophesizin that Ima be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me dont you I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin me as I pull up fill up my tank then peel out
Muscle cars like pullups show you what these big wheels bout
Ah black and successful this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch how can I help you
How can I tell you Im makin a killin
You made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga

Interlude

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me its generational hatred
Its genocism its grimy little justification
Im AfricanAmerican
Im African Im black as the heart of a fuckin Aryan
Im black as the name of Tyrone and Darius excuse my French
But fuck you no fuck yall Thats as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me dont you You hate my people
I can tell cause its threats when I see you I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because youre in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin maliciously he get a chain then you gon bleed him
Its funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin with Pirus only death settle the score
So dont matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State Marcus Garvey got all the answers
Or try to celebrate February like its my Bday
Or eat watermelon chicken and KoolAid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
when gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me
Hypocrite

Intro
Study long study wrong nigga
Hey yall close that front door yall let flies in this muhfucker
Close that door My OG up in this muherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand ackin a fool
Hey hey babe check it out Ima tell you what my mama had said she like

Kendrick Lamar
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin Oh you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness aint the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk we know that its all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

Bridge
Askin where the hoes at to impress me
Askin where the moneybags to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
Its all in your head homie
Askin where the plug at to impress me
Askin where the jug at to impress me
Askin where its at only upsets me
You sound like the feds homie

Chorus
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta try so hard
You aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
You aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie

Kendrick Lamar
And the world dont respect you
and the culture dont accept you but you think its all love
And the girls gon neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation cant protect you if you never had one
Jealousy complex emotional complex
Selfpity complex under oath complex
The loudest one in the room nigga thats a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

Chorus  Bridge

Kendrick Lamar
What do you got to offer
Tell me before we off ya put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction tell me just who your boss is
Niggaz be fugazi bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi niggaz and bitches
who make habitual lyin babies bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me you can never relate me
to him him to her her or that that or them them
Or you you the truth truth you love love to bend bend
In the back back in the bed bed on the floor thats yo ho
On the couch couch in her mouth mouth Ill be out really doe
See loud rich niggaz got low money
And loud broke niggaz got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel

Kendrick Lamar  acapella
I promised Dave Id never use the phrase fuck nigga
He said Think about what you sayin fuck niggas
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats
Sound like I needed some soul searchin
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So Im a dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous sensitive Nword control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
NEGUS definition royalty
King royalty  wait listen
NEGUS description black emperor
King ruler now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies dont recognize we be using it wrong
So Ima break it down and put my game in the song
NEGUS say it with me
Or say no more black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey tell her she right on time

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan onetwo onetwo
Uh when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message

And with that being said my nigga let me ask this question

Interlude Kendrick Lamar
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
Wont you look to your left and right Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan

Kendrick Lamar
Do you believe in me Are you deceivin me
Could I let you down easily Is your heart where it need to be
Is your smile on permanent Is your vow on lifetime
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line
If Im tried in a court of law if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K Lamar
or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind youre very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song its surely a blessing
But a prophet aint a prophet til they ask you this question

Interlude

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Kendrick Lamar
Do you believe in me How much you believe in her
You think she gon stick around if them 25 years occur
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt
You think yall on common ground if you promise to be there first
Can you be immortalised without your life being expired
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time
Like who got your best interest Like how much are you dependent
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretendin
How tough is your skin when they turn you in Do you show forgiveness
What brush do you bend when dustin your shoulders from bein offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissin
What kind of bridge did they burn Revenge on your mind when its mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peacemakin seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone this your lesson for everyone say

Interlude

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The voice of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin with me nigga

Kendrick Lamar
I been wrote off before I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges dont let me resent you
Thats not Nelsonlike want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robbens Island analyzin thats where his cell is
So I could find clarity like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be
See I got to question it all family friends fans cats dogs
Trees plants grass how the wind blow
Murphys Law generation X will I ever be your X
Floss off a baby step mauled by the mouth of pitbulls put me under stress
Crawled under rocks ducking yall its respect
But then tomorrow put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left em for dead
Is it Moses Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red
Is it Martin Luther JFK shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie Is it Jesse Oh I know its Michael Jackson
Oh when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan
That nigga gave us Billie Jean you say he touched those kids
When shit hit the fan is you still a fan

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
The ghost of Mandela hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin with me nigga let me ask this question nigga

I seen it vividly joggin my brain memory
Life no I seen it vividly joggin my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final callin
No birds chirpin or flyin no dogs barkin
We all nervous and cryin movin in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet crackin and crumblin
The ground is shakin swallowin young woman
With a baby daisies and other flowers burnin in destruction
The smell is disgustin the heat is unbearable
Preachers touchin on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust famous screamin in agony
Atheists for suicide planes fallin out the sky
Trains jumpin off the track mothers yellin Hes alive
Backpedalin Christians settlin for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out fire burnin more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom college classrooms been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
Its happenin No more runnin from world wars
Its happenin No more discriminatin the poor
Its happenin No more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishin for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly a moniker of war 
from Heaven that played the symphony thunder like number four
Then I heard What have you did for me I fell to my knees
Pulled out my resume that dated back to June 17th
1987 my paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to Hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that Id excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you say I didnt try for you
Say I didnt ride for you I tithed for you
I pushed the club to the side for you who love you like I love you 
Crucifix tell me you can fix
Anytime I need Ima start jottin everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me always camaraderie
I can see our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearin the last trumpet
All man child woman life completely went in reverse
I guess Im runnin in place tryin to make it to church

Outro
Young nigga act an ass

What did the Asian say A peace of mind
Thats what the Asian said I need a divine
intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believin in Buddha me believin in God
Asked him What are you doin he said Takin my time
Meditation is a must it dont hurt if you try
See you thinkin too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career you ever think of your health
What did the Indian say A piece of land
Thats what the Indian said I needed demand
Tellin me longevitys in the dirt should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best really you should invest
These tangible things expire dont you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage we blessed
Now what the black man say A piece of pussy
Thats what the black man said I needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a wool we like to live in the jungle
Like to play in the peach what you sayin to me
He said Nigga come back to reality for a week
Pussy is power fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldnt be prouder you should allow it
What the white man say A piece of mines
Thats what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Tellin me that he sellin me just for 1099
If I go platinum from rappin I do the company fine
What if I compromise He said it dont even matter
You make a million or more you living better than average
You losin your core followin gainin it all
He put a price on my talent I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
Ima make you some promises that you just cant ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I dont target your market
If you aint signin your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are givin their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your masters mortgage
I need a piece

Tell em when you went to the park and everybody came back and
And welfare dont mean well for you you you you
What about when you tried to do a side for that but you

Do you believe in God If you dont its cool

Chorus Anna Wise
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world toooo me
And that means the world to me

Kendrick Lamar
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular Im drunk
How can I can make them popular Pop em when I want
See Im livin with anxiety duckin the sobriety
Fuckin up the system I aint fuckin with society
Justice aint free therefore justice aint me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now Im thinkin to myself hollow tips is all I got
Now Im drinkin by myself at the intersection parked
Watched you when you walked inside your house you threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creepin through your fuckin door and blowin out
every piece of your brain til your son jumped in your arms
Cut on the engine then sped off in the rain Im gone

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
Drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin the handle

Punch
Lit off Henny Im tryna dismantle
These wicked ways Ive engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel
Wait thats a bit ambitious maybe Im trippin
Maybe Im crazy maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
Its such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still dont recognize my flaws
I guess Im lost the cost of bein successful
is equal to bein neglectful I pray my experience helps you
As for me Im tryna sort it out
Searchin for loopholes in my bruised soul but who knows
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key so I am king

Anna Wise
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh

The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton they tell me that Im blind
I know that Im intelligence my confidence just died

Jay Rock
Carpe diem seize the day I cant compromise
A tapeworm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets they seein me as I pacify
But couldnt fathom the meanin of seein sacrifice

Kendrick Lamar
Im passin lives on a daily maybe Im losin faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why Im awake

Jay Rock
Im sleep walkin Im street stalkin Im out of place
Reinforcin this heat barkin these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates
Or this is just a mirage or a facade Wait

Kendrick Lamar
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I seeee
A Gemini duality personalities always conflict in meeee

Chorus Kendrick Lamar  CeeLo Green
Oh But dont be scared of me girl I can explain
I know its foreign to you I know its hard to believe
God give me the favor let me explain
More than a compliment and I could use some assistance
Let me show you how I can explain
Oh oh shando I spin around two times
Ill be there with the answer let me explain

CeeLo Green
Im bizarre avantgarde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
Its attractive youre intrigued
Am I Mortal Man or make believe
Anything you want I can explain I can explain it
Any misunderstandings baby let me explain I can explain it
Why dont you sit and talk to me awhile I can explain let me explain it
Ahhhh yes let me explain

Kendrick Lamar
My momma told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby no Im not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways praise the Lord
You teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant I mean we
love a woman and think we can satisfy her between sheets
Covers and pillows
Im promisin your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
Im promisin that Im acknowledgin you as my hero cause you believe in me
No youre not easily impressed but I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws look at my flaws look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And thats alright because I like it you and me are the same
Hopefully Im invited hopefully you dont change

Chorus Kendrick Lamar  CeeLo Green
Because I know for sure who you are I can explain
Your momma raised you your daddy raised you
Hand washin your clothes on Sunday let me explain
Walking your brother to school
Three miles away to feed him knowledge so I can explain
Dont you explain that
Dont you explain the reason why your mind it travels let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you but dont you EVER let me explain
Oh oh shando I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise I can explain
I know for sure who you are
Youre the goddess of the odd I am yours I can explain
I am yours I am yours I am yours
I am yoooours yoooours yoooours

Part 2

Kendrick Lamar
Yeah yeah young Egypt
Look look

I feel like Pacino in Godfather Im charged
Our Father who art in Heaven Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin the odds
What an accomplishment broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like yall fear God
You sound frantic I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of makin your choice and writin your bars
Before you poke out your chest loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital
Avenues lookin like evil dead zombies with batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin my stock rise
The salary the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid just premium gas do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags look at my photo
Black excellence pessimist died countin my coin
Hope its evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar
on youth centers buildings and Beamers and blue leather
Forecasted my future this is the future
The mastermind until my next album more power to you gunshot

Kendrick Lamar
Why so sad

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
Walkin around with them blue faces
She said Im down on my luck
And its somethin I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them Color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money and its breakin me down honey

Kendrick Lamar
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
Uh but I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I reup
See I barely have patience and youre relatin
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
You plead the fifth I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut my success Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute Now why you so sad

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you woman I console you woman
You feel like the universe owes you woman
Oh the anticipation of hopin you could make it
Bitches dont prosper chasin education
But youre talented and cant handle it
And your homegirls cant be your manager
365 times four plus more
If ya cant get it right tell me do you got the stamina
But shit aint no money like fast money
Even today Im considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasin stardom how can I fast forward
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I wrote this song lookin at a broke home baby broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies broke boy and babies
Somebody yell Kendrick American they sho is crazy
And I said Why Then he looked me in the eye

And said Nigga you fucked up youre bankin on good luck
You wishin for miracles you never been through shit
Youre cryin hysterical you settle for everythin
Complain about everythin you say you sold crack my world amphetamine
Your projects aint shit I live in a hut bitch
Im livin to keep warm you livin to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waitin on Allah
You played your way through by livin in scifi
Bullshittin yourself you talkin to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When yall came on the boat lookin for hope
And all you can say is that youre lookin for dope
These days aint no compromise
And your pain aint mines half the time
A brand new excuse aint shit to me
Bitch I made my moves with shackled feet
Cape Town

Interlude
In todays day and age
We practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them him and her
But when a blessing takes too long thats when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker why so sad

So I was takin a walk the other day

She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin and havin a hard time findin it
So after watchin her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand you know 
Hello maam can I be of any assistance 
It seems to me that you have lost something

She replied Oh yes you have lost something

Kendrick Lamar
I got I got I got I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power poison pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this since one like this immaculate conception
I transform like this perform like this was Yeshuas new weapon
I dont contemplate I meditate then off your fuckin head
This that put the kids to bed
This that  I got I got I got I got realness
I just kill shit cause its in my DNA
I got millions I got riches buildin in my DNA
I got dark I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again then win again like Wimbledon I serve
Yeah thats him again the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work I know just who you are
See yous a yous a yous a bitch your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched heritage inside your DNA
Backbone dont exist born outside a jellyfish I gauge
See my pedigree most definitely dont tolerate the front
Shit Ive been through prolly offend you this is Paulas oldest son
I know murder conviction burners boosters burglars ballers dead redemption
Scholars fathers dead with kids and I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah yeah yeah yeah soldiers DNA
Born inside the beast my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9 on cell motel we didnt have nowhere to stay
At 29 Ive done so well hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like Im supposed to antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work and absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve and thats a riff gonna plead this case
The reason my powers here on Earth salute the truth when the prophet say

Interlude Kendrick Lamar
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage 
to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA

I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA I live a better fuck your life

This is my heritage all Im inheritin money and power the makin of marriages

Kendrick Lamar
Tell me somethin
You mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when youre in the Matrix dodgin bullets
Reapin what you sow and stackin up the footage
Livin on the go and sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin out the window
Baby in the pool Godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
Phone never on I dont conversate
I dont compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder these are the breaks
These are the times level number nine
Look up in the sky ten is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
Peace to the world let it rotate
Sex money murder our DNA

Mike Jordan whenever holdin a real mic I aint feelin your presence
Feel like Ima learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin aint mutual I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin of no hope
The feelin of bad dope a quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin the feelin of false freedom
Ill forcefeed em the poison that fill em up in the prison
I feel like its just me
Look I feel like I cant breathe look I feel like I cant sleep
Look I feel heartless often off this
Feelin of fallin of fallin apart with darkest hours lost it
Fillin the void of bein employed with ballin
Streets is talkin fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit internet blogs and pulpit fill em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin what Pac was
The feelin of an apocalypse happenin but nothin is awkward
The feelin wont prosper the feelin is toxic
I feel like Im boxin demons monsters
False prophets schemin sponsors industry promises
Niggas bitches honkies crackers Compton
Church religion token blacks and bondage
Lawsuit visits subpoena served in concert
FUCK your feelings I mean this for imposters
I can feel it the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin I feel like take somethin
I feel like skatin off I feel like waitin for em
Maybe its too late for em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for em

The better part the human heart you love em or dissect em
Happiness or flashiness How do you serve the question
See in the perfect world I would be perfect world
I dont trust people enough beyond they surface world
I dont love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics hopin I make amend
I understand I aint perfect I probably wont come around
This time I might put you down last time I aint give a fuck I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb youre dealin with cold thumb
Im willin to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world you probably live another 24

Kendrick Lamar
Now in a perfect world I probably wont be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldnt blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
I know the walls they can listen I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See in a perfect world Ill choose faith over riches
Ill choose work over bitches Ill make schools out of prison
Ill take all the religions and put em all in one service
Just to tell em we aint shit but Hes been perfect world

Yeah I need everybodys motherfuckin hands up right now

Door and his Nike Air Rattles rush the fire exit
No time for battles well I I never expected

Kendrick Lamar
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch dont go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make you
Door in his Nike Air Rattles rush the fire exit
No time for battles well I I never expected
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy  hol up
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch dont go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies stunt on your baby mama sip some lean
Go get a pistol shoot out the window bet your favorite team
Play you some Madden go to the club or your momma house
Whatever you doin just make it count I need some water
Wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
Hop in the shower put on your makeup lace your weave up
Touch on yourself call up your nigga tell him he aint shit
Credit card scam get you a Visa make him pay your rent
Hop on the Gram flex on the bitches that be hatin on you
Pop you a pill call up your bitches have em waitin on you
Go to the club have you some fun make that ass bounce
Its whatever just make it count

Chorus

Kendrick Lamar
I wake in the mornin my head spinnin from the last night
Both in the trance feelings are dead what a fast life
Manager called the lobby called its 1130
Did this before promised myself Id be a hour early
Room full of clothes bag full of money call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry 100K I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin for confirmation hopin election wasnt true
All of us worried all of us buried and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal make us feel cheap
Still and sad distraught and mad tell the neighbor bout it
Bet they agree parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin things change
Revertin back to our daily programs stuck in our ways
Lust

Interlude Kendrick Lamar
Lately I feel like I been lustin over the fame
Lately we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately lately lately my lust been hidin lately
Lately its all contradiction  lately Im not here
Lately I lust over self  lust turn into fear
Lately in James 44 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself lust is all yours

Yesterday I got a call like from my dawg like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin he was mobbin way belligerent and drunk
Talkin out his head philosphin on what the Lord had done
He said KDot can you pray for me Its been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
He was lookin for some closure hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do no better but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin killed
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like Bitch I did that
Aint no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace dont you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece touch my nephew touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact Im bout to speak at this convention call you back

Alright kids were gonna talk about gun control

But is America honest or do we bask in sin Pass the gin

You Crippin or you married to Blood Ill ask again
Oops accident
Its nasty when you set us up then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell FOX to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera

Whats up family Yeah this your cousin Carl man
Just givin you a call man
I know you been havin a lot on yo mind lately
and I know you feel like you know people aint been prayin for you
But you have to understand this man that we are a cursed people
Deuteronomy 2828 says The Lord shall smite thee with madness
and blindness and astonishment of heart
See family thats why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you finally get the memo you will always feel that way

Interlude Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr

I beat yo ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes
Runnin from Poo Poo and Prentice go back outside
I beat yo ass lil nigga that homework better be finished I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted you eat it all that TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought em
Better not hear bout you humpin on Keishas daughter
Better not hear you got caught up I beat yo ass you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass you know my patience runnin thin I got beaucoup payments to make
County buildins on my ass tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here

Seven years old think you run this house by yourself
Nigga you gon fear me if you dont fear no one else

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
If I could smoke fear away Id roll that mothafucka up

Ill prolly die anonymous Ill prolly die with promises
Ill prolly die walkin back home from the candy house
Ill prolly die because these colors are standin out
Ill prolly die because I aint know Demarcus was snitchin
Ill prolly die at these house parties fuckin with bitches
Ill prolly die from witnesses leavin me falsed accused
Ill prolly die from thinkin that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin the line actin too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
Ill prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint my bones snappin
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein too laxed 
Or die from waitin on it die cause Im movin too fast
Ill prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
Ill prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin
Ill prolly die cause thats what you do when youre 17
All worries in a hurry I wish I controlled things

Chorus Kendrick Lamar
If I could smoke fear away Id roll that mothafucka up
And then Id take two puffs 
Ive been hungry all my life

Kendrick Lamar
When I was 27 I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated ten times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money is God playin a joke on me
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before
At 27 my biggest fear was losin it all
Scared to spend money had me sleepin from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my momma stressin
Thirty shows a month and I still wont buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor Somebody thats holdin my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
I read a case about Rihannas accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
The type of shitll make me flip out and just kill somethin drill somethin
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin
I practiced runnin from fear guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old my biggest fear was bein judged
How they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
What they say bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make em highlight my simplest lines
Im talkin fear fear of losin creativity
Im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me
Im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride
Cause my DNA wont let me involve in the light of God
Im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone
Im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more
Im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness
Fear whatever it is both is distinctive
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Searchin for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
Wonderin if Im livin through fear or livin through rap
Damn

Interlude Bekon
Goddamn you goddamn me
Goddamn us goddamn we
Goooddamn us all

Outro Carl Duckworth
Verse two says You only have I known of all the families of the Earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments were gonna feel this way
Were gonna be under this curse because He said hes gonna punish us
The socalled Blacks Hispanics and Native American Indians
are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel Hes gonna punish us for our iniquities
for our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods 
that are the last as of his son so the Lord thy God chasten thee
So just like you chasten your own son
Hes gonna chastise you because He loves you
So thats why we get chastised thats why were in the position that were in
Until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments
and do what the Lord said these curses are gonna be upon us
Were gonna be at a lower state in this life 
that we live here in today in United States of America
I love you son and I pray for you
God bless you shalom

Everything I touch is a damn gold mine everything I say is from an angel

Kendrick Lamar
Oh Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana times is hard
Pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives Im a star
Life is one funny mufucka
A true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
I might be buggin infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts children listen it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest povertys dialect
Adaptation inevitable
Gun violence crack spot federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Wellrespected calm and collected
Laughin and jokin made life easier
Hard times momma on crack a fouryearold tellin his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin and bangin
He was meant to be dangerous clocked him a grip and start slangin
Fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodgin policemen workin for his big homie
Smalltime hustler graduated to a brick on him
10000 dollars out of a project housin thats on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters  caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin but witnesses couldnt prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin
Birdshufflin Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the twotone Mustang that 50 thing
They say 50 came circlin parkin lots and parkin spots
And hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it he brushed them off
And walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken see at this chicken spot
There was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth he worked the window
His name was Ducky he came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside projects Chiraq the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hopin that hed see college
Hustlin on the side with a ninetofive to freak it
Cadillac Seville hed ride his son around on weekends
Threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket
Cross the street from the projects Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in 84
Thats when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin us sellin us devilish works killin us crime
Intelligent felonious prevalent proposition with 9s
Ducky was well aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured hed get on these niggas good sides free chicken 
Every time Anthony posted in line two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didnt kill him in fact it look like theyre the last to survive
Pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma and Ill tell you why
You take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
Give em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers you make em meet again
Inside recordin studios where they reapin their benefits
Then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky Top Dawg could be servin life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight gunshot

So I was takin a walk the other day
